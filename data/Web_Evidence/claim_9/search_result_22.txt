We know what the Second Amendment was meant to protect. Not this | Opinion
Original intent of the Second Amendment
When the Second Amendment was written, the only available, existing weapons I am aware of were musket rifles and large cannons, not rapid-fire assault rifles nor nuclear bombs.
Very little is mentioned in public about the actual wording of the Second Amendment: “A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” This seems clearly to limit bearing of arms to those within a regulated militia, i.e. those supporting the state — not to any person any time.
So, we owe it to our kids and grieving parents to enact a national ban on rapid-fire weapons, perhaps allowing single shot hunting rifles if kept securely locked.

Rethinking the military parade
The parade was beautiful. Perfectly coordinated men and women marching. Height, head angle, uniforms matched to resemble an army of perfect puppets. Faces and mouth movements identical.
I enjoyed watching. It was beautiful. It must have taken years to prepare. As the columns glided by, I imagined the daily drills. Practicing, to pure exhaustion. Seamstresses to ensure hems matched. Officers with rulers measuring height. Each scared to death of making a mistake.
People say the president fumed, comparing the Chinese parade with his own hodge-podge birthday procession. His military members strolled by and laughed to the crowds without paying attention to the VIPs they were there to impress.
They had fun. They’re proud of their country. And they were not afraid. They are ready, willing and able to serve. They know that they would never be asked to serve as cannon fodder for another country in a war raged by a lunatic. And they prepare not by coordinating their facial expressions but by learning how to defend their country. And they’re really good at that. They’ll give their life for their country not because they have to but because they choose to.
So which military, Mr. President, do you prefer?

Package theft in Gig Harbor
I am writing regarding concerns about the U.S. Postal Service here in Gig Harbor.
Over the past several weeks, our neighborhood has been the victim of mail theft wherein our USPS supplied secured mailboxes (totalling 6 in our neighborhood of 15 mailboxes per station) have been opened by a criminal who reportedly has either forged or stolen a master key to the locks.

To this end, they have stolen mail, credit cards and packages and have been successful in this theft to the sum of thousands of dollars of theft (I personally suffered $8000 in charges). When I spoke with the USPS supervisor yesterday, I was informed “there is no stolen master key” and that we “are responsible to keep our mailboxes secure” even though there is no physical evidence of tampering to the mail stations.
They also informed that they were powerless to intervene until they hear from the Post Office Inspector. They suggested that we set up a surveillance camera on our neighborhood; I believe that a government agency should not expect users to enact vigilante surveillance on their property.
