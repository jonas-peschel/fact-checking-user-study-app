President Donald Trump on Monday shared a video accusing Michigan Democrats of “laundering” $5 billion in taxpayer money in the state’s budget.
The video misrepresents and conflates claims made by Michigan House Republicans about what they said was $5 billion worth of “fraud, waste and abuse” axed from the state’s budget in their proposed spending plan.
Trump shared the video on social media without comment. It was created by media personality Christina Aguayo and captioned “Michigan Democrats have been caught Laundering $5 BILLION in taxpayer money.”
In the video, Aguayo claims House Republicans uncovered a “fraud scheme” where money from more than 4,000 allegedly fake jobs in the state budget was being redirected. According to the video, this money went to “questionable gender surgeries for prisoners,” “dubious” arts and culture grants and programs that didn’t exist.
“House GOP investigators claim to have identified the thousands of fake job positions created to justify budget allocations that never materialized into actual employment,” Aguayo said in the video. “Critics argue this was a deliberate tactic to funnel public money back to Democrats, bypassing accountability and oversight.”
House Republicans haven’t claimed the dollars allocated for 4,300 non-existent “ghost employees” on the payrolls are being redirected to gender surgeries, arts and culture grants, non-existent programs or “back to Democrats.”
The dollars that would be saved from axing those positions also totals about $750 million, according to House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township.
Hall has said the departments are using these dollars to “make money.”
“That’s money that (departments) are collecting from taxpayers and they’re just keeping, they’re holding onto it, so we’re going to end that practice pretty fast,” Hall said of the money.
State departments have directed inquiries about the Republican budget to the State Budget Office, which has previously declined to comment about the phantom employee claims.
State Budget Office officials were unable to comment in time for publication Monday.
Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel called Trump’s post sharing the video a “blatant lie” and an attempt to distract from “the disastrous state budget that state House Republicans are pushing.”
“Once again, Trump is lying to Michiganders to try to score political points for his Republican lap dogs in the state House,” Hertel said. “His claim is incredibly misleading, yet he’s still pushing this lie in an attempt to distract Michiganders from the fact that Republicans’ state budget proposal defunds the police and ends free breakfast and lunch at schools.
“Republicans know that their budget is deeply unpopular, so they have to resort to deception and fiction to try to get their budget passed. At the end of the day, Republicans at every level are abandoning working Michigan families and raising prices on everything.”
The attention from Trump on Michigan’s budget comes as negotiations between the Republican-led House, Democratic-led Senate and governor’s office continue to stall.
Lawmakers have until midnight Sept. 30 to agree on a 2025-2026 spending plan and get that compromise budget before Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for her signature if they want to avoid a government shutdown.
“I’m not going to waste one more breath responding to troll posts from the party of lies and deceit,” Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, said of the video. “We have 22 days to get a budget done.”
The House Republican spending plan would slash nearly every state department and agency budget for a total of $7.26 billion. A portion of these savings would fund the House’s $3.4 billion plan to repair the state’s crumbling bridges and roads.
In unveiling that plan in late August, Hall touted their budget as one that cuts “$5 billion in waste, fraud and abuse” in government operations and redirects those dollars to “priorities that people care about, like roads, public safety and education.”
About $2.5 billion of it comes from what Hall called department “slush funds,” accounts where he said dollars for unfilled positions or work projects that aren’t completed are stored away.
Hall claimed these departments lie about what the money is for and then “squirrel it away.”
State Rep. Matt Maddock, R-Milford, alleged some of the dollars were being misspent but didn’t give any examples of expenditures. He said it could equate to embezzlement and that the U.S. Department of Justice “may be looking into this.”
“You know, what we’re on to here, this, in my opinion, this fraud, they are using money that was appropriated to use for a specific purpose by the lawmakers in this town, the people that were elected to tell government where and how to spend money, and they are completely ignoring us,” Maddock said.
Other parts of the $5 billion figure come from eliminating a state fund to attract large-scale investments, the state’s COVID-19 task force, arts and culture grants and more, Hall has said.
