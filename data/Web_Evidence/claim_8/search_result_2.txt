�rial and helped Mr. Clinton during his
presidential campaign to deflect criticism from Vietnam veterans, combined his statement of support with one
chiding the President for "an embargo
on vets" within the Administration
White House officials said they could
not dispute Mr. Wheeler's assertion
that only 8 percent of the men among
Mr. Clinton's senior appointees are
military veterans.
With the presidential directive he
issued today to the Departments bf
State, Treasury and Commerce, Mr.
Clinton set aside the embargo the United States imposed agamst North Vietnam in 1964 and extended to cover all
of Vietnam after the fall of the South
Vietnamese Govemment on April 30,
1975.
Other Restrictions Remain
Administration officials emphasized
tonight that the lifting of the embargo
would not spell an end to other restrictions imposed by Congress against
Vietnam, which will continue to prohibit sales of weapons and some hightechnology goods. In an odd twist, they
also said the Trading with the Enemy
Act would be left in place, although
only to insure that Vietnamese assets
frozen by the United States remain in
American control until the two countries can agree on their disposition.
The officials also strongly rejected
characterizations that the step represented a reward for Vietnamese for
cooperation, and spoke with some lingering bitterness at a briefing today of
the years in which Vietnam had confounded rather than helped the American search for the missing.
Mr. Clinton, who took extraordinary
steps to avoid military service in Vietnam, was in the odd position today as
Commander-in-Chief of marking an
end of sorts to a war in which he, unlike
many of his contemporaries, did not
take pan. But he insisted today that his
decision had not been complicated by
that fact.
"Everybody my age, whethe» they
were in Vietnam or not, knew someone
who died there, knew someone who was
wounded there," the 47-year-old President said. "And I think people in our
generation are perhaps more insistent
on trying to get a full accounting, more
obsessed with it, than perhaps people
who are younger and people who are
older, except those who had children."
Mr. Clinton said he believed that "all
the people my age just want to know
we've done everything we can. And I
think this is consistent with doing
that."
Nominee for Pentagon Job Gets a New Post

WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 - The candidate forced to withdraw last month as
President Clinton's choice to head a
new Pentagon peacekeeping policy job,

much the same work, but will nol need
Senate confirmation.
Administration officials said today

Union, will be shortly become a Special
Assistant to the President m charge of

if the polls are to be believed, agree
with Mr. Clinton and with the Senate,
which voted overwhelmingly last week
lo end lhe embargo.

The flag follows li ade, it is said, and
muiual diplomatic recognition beiween
Hanoi and Washington is not likely lo
he delayed many years more, Ihough
die President specified that il would
have to wait upon "a full and final
accouniing" of America's losses.
Slowly, almost imperceptibly, Vietnam has turned from a tragedy into an
opportunity. Having watched their
(iei man and British counterparts makinp large invesiments there, having
pondered Ihe prospects of turning the
one lime enemy inlo the next Thai- or
Malay style success story, American
businessmen have pushed relentlessly
for loday's change.
But it took more than that; it took a
polilical slralcgy- That was cobbled
togelher largely by Winston Lord, the
Assistant Secretary of Stale for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs, who persuaded Hanoi to provide enough answers lo Ihe vexed question of prisoners of war and servicemen still missing
to enable Mr. Clinion to win the support
of important public figures who had Ihe

credibility on Vietnam lhat he did not.
Among those, by far the mosl important were a pair of Senators — John
Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who
won the Silver Star as a patrol-boat
commander in the Delta, and John
McCain, an Arizona Republican, the
son and grandson of admirals, who
bailed out of his naval attack plane
after il was hit over North Vietnam and
spent five and a half years in an enemy
prison camp.
" I feel we are finally putting Ihis war
behind us, as we have put every war
behind us," Senator McCain said by
lelephone from his home in Phoenix.
"A nation must do that, and 1 am
grateful to have survived to see it,
when so many of my friends did nol. I
feel it is in our Interest lo have a strong,
counterweight lo China, Ihe growing
mililary and economic power In the
region, and 1 feel Ihis will help us a lol
economically."
Anolher who served In Vielnam emphasized the geopolitical aspect.
"We really need lo have a relationship with these people, not for Ihe pasl
bul for (he future," said Frank Wisner,
a career diplomat, now a senior Defense Department official, who served

�other cities, is directed by Jeremy Rifkin, a Washington-based critic of biotechnology.
Mr. Rifkin said in an interview on
Wednesday that the campaign's sue-'cess in convincing companies to restrict the use of the drug illustrated the
public's concern over an artificially
produced hormone, which he said had
not been adequately studied by the
Govemment. "We believe this product
is a hazard to health," he said.
Bui Jeffrey Nedelman, a spokesman
in Washington for the Grocery Manufacturers of America, which represents the $400 billion food manufacturing industry, said the Government had
thoroughly studied the drug and declared it safe for people as well as
cows. Mr. Nedelman said consumers
and food companies were being misled
hy Mr. Rifkin's "theatrics and scare
tactics."
Kraft , McDonalds and Lando'lakes
are among the companies that have
been targeted by Mr. Rifkin's campaign, but they have not issued any
directives to their milk suppliers, according to Mr. Nedelman.
Nervous About Reaction
Nevertheless, Mr. Rifkin's campaign
appears to have made enough consumers worried about the drug that some
companies felt ihey had to respond. In
almost every case, the companies and
food distributors said they were taking
action to ban the hormone in their milk
and dairy products, not because they
believed it was dangerous but because
they were nervous about how their
customers would react
"Food is an emotional issue," said
Cecilia Norwood, a spokeswoman for
Southland. "We felt a responsibility to
take this action because of concern
expressed by our customers."
Never in the long history of technological innovation in American agricul
ture, ranging from the invention of the
cotton gin in the late 18th century to the
introduction of chemical pesticides 50
years ago, has the advent of a new
farm technology stirred such a reaction.
Supporters of agricultural biotechnology say the hormone will help usher
in an era of greater efficiency and
environmentally safer practices on
American farms.
Jim Winkel, a dairy farmer in Vogel
Center, Mich., said yesterday that he
! was anxious to test the hormone in his
herd of 340 cows. "We are a business,
he said, "and if it helps us become
more efficient and competitive, that's
the name of the game."
Ift-Year Govemment Review
The genetically engineered hormone,
known as bovine somatotropin, is produced by the St. Louis-based Monsanto
Company, which will market the drug,
beginning today, under the tradename
Posilac.
A Monsanto spokeswoman, Karen
Marshall, said it would be several days
before the first farmers received Posilac, and it would not begin to be used on
farms until next week.
The drug was made by isolating a
gene that produces natural growth hormone in cows and inserting it into
bacteria. The drug has been under review by the Govemment since 1984,
and last November the F.D_A. approved its commerical use. Congress
then imposed a 90-day moratorium on
the sale of the drug, which expired

,
A day before the introduction of a
neir, genetically engineered growth
hormone designed to boost milk production in dairy cows, some of the
country's largest food companies and
distributors took measures yesterday
to restrict the use of the animal drug.
Among the companies moving to!
keep their dairy suppliers from using
the gene-altered drug, the first important product of agriculture biotechnology to be used to produce food, were the
Kroger Company, the nation's largest
supermarket chain, the Southland Corporation, owners and franchisrs of .
Eleven convenience stores, and Pathmark Stores Inc.
But three of the New York metropolitan region's largest supermarket
chains, A.& P.. Shoprite and Foodtown,
said they would continue to buy milk
from their distributors much as they
have in the past The chains said that
while they are worried about how their
customers will react, they cannot
pledge to ban milk produced by cows
that are given the drug because it is
difficult for them to insure that individual dairy farmers are not using it.
F.D.A. Guidance Sought
:
Some companies and several states
also have asked the Food and Drug
Administration for guidance on how to
label milk and dairy products to alert
customers that they do not contain
milk produced with the genetically engineered hormone.
Jim O'Hara, the F.D.A.'s chief
spokesman, said the agency was considering the requests, but he declined
to discuss what the F.D.A. was considering or when any guidance documents
would be issued.
The company-imposed restrictions
came despite years of review of the
drug by the F.D.A., the National Institutes of Health and the American Medical Association, all of whom have said
the genetically engineered hormone is
safe. The food and drug agency has
said that milk produced with the genetically engineered hormone is indistinguishable from milk th?' r r
In large measure, the companies are
responding to the Pure Food Campaign, a coalition of farmers, consumer
groups, animal welfare organizations
and others opposed to the hormone.
The campaign, which carried out protests that included the symbolic dumping of milk in New York and several

'the stakes in the debate are significant, not only for the companies that
have invested billions of dollars in new
agricultural biotechnology products,
but also for the technology's critics,
especially Mr. Rifkin, who has vowed
to stop agricultural biotechnology by
halting the hormone, its first important
invention. In the interview, Mr. Rifkin
said the campaign had 18 full-time
workers and was spending roughly
$100,000 a month.
"The Amencan consumer is moving
away from high-tech foods, away from
hormones and chemicals and additives
and processed foods," he said. "The
wave in food production is toward a
natural, sustainable agriculture. Monsanto and the grocery manufacturers
who support this product have grossly
miscalculated the trend."
I Even as they moved to restrici the

to enforce their restrictions. All milk
contains detectable levels of the
growth hormone naturally, and the
man-made hormone is indistinguishable, said the F.D.A. Thus the Kroger,
Company,.which is based in Cincinnati,:
said that while it has written to its milk j
producers that it "prefers" that they
not use the drug, which is sometimes
referred to as BST, they also said they
could not "guarantee" farmers would
comply.
"It's our conviction this is not a
safety issue," said Paul Bernish, a
Kroger spokesman. "By the same token, consumers may be unsure about
BST and we are concerned that they
might overreact and stop buying dairy
products."
A spokesman fpr the Great Atlantic
and Pacific Tea Company, which operates about 300 A.&P. supermarkets in
the New York area, said it was surveying its dairy distributors to find out if
they plan to u * the drug.
"But that's asfar as we've got," said
William Vitulfi, an A.&P. vice president "Right now ww're not prepared to
come forward and say that all our milk
will be hormone-frea. We can't It's a
very confusing and nebulous condi' tioa"
Mary Ellin Gowin, & vice president
of the Wakefem Food Corporation, the
distribution arm of Shoprite supermarkets, said: " If we had our own herd and
were responsible for the management
of cows of our own, then we could say
fo. sure that all the milk was from
regular cows. But we're not in that
posiUon."
The company, like many other supermarket chains and cooperatives,
j buys its dairy products from large
dairy distributors that in tum buy the
milk from hundreds of individual dairy
farms. Because the protein hormone is
produced by a cow's pituitary .gland
and is already present in some quantities in milk, it is impossible for distributors or their buyers to test for i t

PARIS, Feb. 3 — Ruling In a longfestering border dispute that has
caused repeated outbreaks of violence,
the International Court of Justice today
rejected Libya's claims to a large
swath of neighboring Chad's territory.
The 17-member court, the judicial
arm of the United Nations, ruled by 16
votes to 1 that the border was set by a
1955 jreaty between Libya and France,
the former colonial power In Chad, and
that the claims of the Libyan leader.

Overhauling School Grants:
Much Debate but Little Gain
By MICHAEL WINERIP
Specul to TTie New Yor* Times
WASHINGTON — Last \ M .
ounng Senate hearings on the
abuses of student financial aid
programs by colleges and trade
schools, che senators were quizzinc Education Department officials about ways to reduce the
billions of dollars in annual losses,
when the subject turned to political interference.
"Every Congressman I have
ialked to wants us to manage this
program more lightly," said Dr.
David Longanecker, the Assistant
Secretary of Education responsible for higher education aid. "On
the other hand, when it comes
down to an institution that happens to be in their general jurisdiction, it is a different story. Thai
is obviously a more legitimate
institution than the others we
should be shutting down."
Eroding Enforcement
There was a burst of laughter in
the Senate hearing room — some
of it nervous. After five hearings
in the last four years exposing
misuse of Federal student-aid
money by colleges and for-profit
trade schools, the Education Department has a good idea of what
needs to be done to regain fiscal
control. The tougher question is,
does Congress really have the political will to let Education do the
job?
It hasn't until now. And as happens in Washington, it is no one's
fault in particular that student aid
programs are losme S3 billion to
$4 billion annually to defaults,
fraud and waste. A favor for the
Congressmen from New York and
Michgan; an amendmeni for that
trade school lobbyist; a lawsuit
by a college association; a piece
of regulatory legislation that is
quietly positioned from 1993 to
1995 — and bit by bit the Education Depanment's enforcement
powers get nibbled away.
The Senator from Michigan nit>bles. For years Senator Carl Levin has successfully pressed the
Education Department to let Jordan College in Cedar Springs,
Mich., remain eligible for the $6
million in student aid it receives
annually. Senator Levin, a Democrat, points out thai Jordan
serves 2,000 mostly poor, minority
students. It is also a school with a
student loan default rate ihat has
reached as high as 51 percent,

is seeking, that is not accredited

Lobbyists With Friends
Then last fall in heanngs before the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investiations.
witnesses testified that many of these same
yeshivas offered cursory courses and siphoned off student aid to pay for the Hasidics' religious operations here and in Israel.
The Education Department was suddenly
spurred to suspend 21 schools from the Federal program. But the schools had already
collected $300 million in Pell grants over the
previous decade.
The education lobbyists in Washingion nibble, too. The nation's student aid programs
were created in the 1960's with traditional
four-year colleges in mind. But through the
years, these programs have been squeezed,
bent and amended to take in education as
diverse as Duke University, hairstyling
schools or courses in pri'-rr!. Efforts to create
separate aid programs have been resisted by
the for-profit trade schools and their allies in
Congress, like Representative William Ford,
Democrat of Michigan, the House Educaiion
Commitiee chairman who once attended a
trade school himself. They point out that
about a third of the trade schools offer degree
programs of two years or longer, and they
say it would be elitist to differentiate.
Delaying Regulation
After Passage,
Postponement
As might be expected, when someone tries
to write a law broad enough to regulate both
Duke University and the Tulsa Academy of
Hairstyling, it is not completely suited to
either. And so, Duke sends its lobbyists into
the Congressional trenches to nibble off paru
of the law they do not like and the hairstylists
send their lobbyists, and by ihe time they are
all through, the regulatory law has some
good-sized loopholes.
Consider the attempts to regulate something as basic as the number of years a
sludent can qualify for a Pell gram, the
Federal Government's major scholarship
program. In 1976. on the heels of student aid
scandals during thai period. Congress passed
antifraud legislation limiting eligibility to
five years. Just as that law was to take effect
in 1980, Congress repealed it. In 1986, Congress again passed legislation, and again, as
it was to take effect in 1992, it was repealed

Continued on Page AJ6. Column i graduate education.
Who was responsible for undoing the regulatory legislation? Lobbyists for the major
trade school group, the Career College Association. They argue that if a person studies
several years for a technical degree, goes to
work in his field and then, because of shifts in
the economy, is laid off. he should be able to
get more Pell aid for retraining.
Or consider the fate of a basic piece of
consumer legislation entitling students to
find out the graduation rate of a college or
trade school they are thinking of attending.
The Educaiion Department tried to enact
student right-to-know regulations in 1986 but
was blocked in Congress, which eventually
passed a watered-down Sludent Right to
Know Act in 1990. Just as the law was lo go
into effect in 1993. it was postponed until 1995.

Who was responsible? The lobbyist for the
colleges and universities, the Amencan
Council on Education. "We urged a postponement," says Robert Atwell, the president.
While he acknowledges "we are not graduatir.e enough ot our entrants." he says calculating graauanon raies is a very complicated
issue" and could penalize nontraditional colleges that have many pan-time and evening
students.

1995. Dr. Longanecker. the Assistant Secretary, said: "1 don't know where it came from
Not from us."
Eroding Regulation
Schools Amend
Potent New Law
In some respects this is a hopeful period
for those favoring tougher regulation of the
7,400 college and trade schools participaiing
in these aid programs. President Clinton's
appointees are acting more aggressively
than any education leaders in years. They
plan to add several hundred staff positions to
the financial aid section, create the depanment's first training program for auditors
and triple to 1,000 the number of schools that
are placed on a strict reimbursement schedule for their Federal aid grants.
They have also started taking advantage of
new tools in the 1992 Higher Education Act,
the most ambitious attempt by Congress tn a
long time to cut waste and abuse.
For example, that law allows the Education Departmem io give provisional approval
to new schools seeking to participate in financial aid programs. During the first two years,
these schools can be terminated from aid
programs immediately with virtually none of
the appeals that usually stymie the department. About 160 schools were given provisional approval last year.
But the history of Federal student aid
programs is that time works against stricter
regulation. Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia
Democrat who is chairman of the Investigations Subcommitlee, held his first heanngs
on trade school fraud in 1975; by ihe mid-80's.
he said, "it all reoccurred — it takes constant
monitoring."
The trade schools worked hard last fall to
amend the 1992 law to their liking. "We did
have several subsuntial successes," says a
recent Career College Association newslener
sent to 1,300 member schools.
The trade schools' biggest victory was
amending the department's procedures for
using student loan default rates as an enforcement tool against problem schools —
typically trade schools, which have a default
rate six times higher than public four-year
colleges.
The Loan-Default Rule
Since 1991, the Educaiion Depanment has
had the authority to terminate a school from
the loan program if more than 30 percent of
the school's students defaulted for three
straight years. It is one of the department's
most effective tools and has been partly
responsible for a decline in loan defaults,
from $3.6 billion in 1931 to $15 billia.. last
year. Some of the worst abuses in recent
years have involved trade schools that signed
up any warm body they could find for Federally guaranteed student loans, ultimately
leaving the Govemment stuck with the bill
for those defaulted loans.
Last fall ai the Senate heanngs, Dr. Longanecker. the Assistant Secretary, asked for
Congressional suppon on the trade schools'
attempt to weaken this enforcement tool.
He did not get it.
In November, the jducation committees in
Congress approved a measure, now signed
into law. ihat gives a school the right to
challenge a default rate before the department publishes it. Moreover, i l gives lhe
school an additional ground for appeal after
publication, the right to challenge wheiher
loans were properly serviced.
Slephen Blair, president of the trade school
association, says his schools' default rates
are higher because they give opponunities to
poor inner-city students. He points out that
Or
�the trade schools have won several legal
challenges to the Education Department's
calculation of rates, and that the new appeal
procedure is necessary to guarantee that
Govemment default rates are accurate.
But, says Dr. Longanecker of the Education Department, "Everyone appeals."
Describing one school that could have been
"kicked out two years ago," he said education officials had calculated its default rate at
53 percent. After the school appealed, the
rate was recalculated to be 51, "and it's still
going on." he said. (He relused to identify the
school.)
Lobbying by Schools
Well-Meaning
Laws,
Not Well-Received
The trade school lobbyists are still working
on modifying the new "85-15" rule in the 1992
Higher Education Act, which is scheduled to
go into effect next fail. The rule says thai if a
school is to qualify for Federal student aid, no
more than 85 percent of its revenue can come
from Federal student aid programs. It was
sponsored by Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat whose Califomia districl is
lhe poor, heavily black core of Los Angeles,
and who wants to insure that these schools
are good enough to attract some minimal
number of students willing to invest their
own money.
Representative Waters says the poor are
too often victims of trade schools that get
virtually all their money from Govemment
grants, offer worthless courses and skim
student aid money, leaving students unqualified for jobs and entangled with legal problems because they cannot repay the loans.
The trade school lobbyists say lhat if the
85-15 rule takes effect, two-thirds of their
schools will be harmed and many in urban
areas will be forced io close. Mr. Blair has

staned lining up suppon.
"Congressman Kildee, a senior member of
the House education and labor committee
and nine other committee members have
also pledged io help us with this issue." says
Mr. Blair's newsletter. "Keep up the pressure on your members of Congress."
According to its latest available tax return,
the trade school association spent $1.9 million
on its national lobbving and advertising drive
m 1992.
A spokesman for Representative Dale Kildee said the Democrat's district in Flint.
Mich., includes several quality trade schools
that serve the poor and would be hurt by the
amendment.
College and university lobbyists plan a
busy spring, too. To supplement the Education Department's meager enforcement
staff, the 1992 law creates a formal partnership between Federal and stale regulators.
The idea is to stretch resources and minimize regulatory duplication. The new effort,
the State Postsecondary Review Program,
lets state regulators audit a college's management of not only state, but also Federal
aid programs, giving states the power to take
enforcement action against a school for state
or Federal violations. The law also gives
states $22 million in Federal money for extra
enforcemeni workers.
Dr. Longanecker strongly supports the
new law, but predicts "we'll get a lot of
pressure and we may get efforts to change
the law."
In the first week of January, representatives of 20 major universities, including
Georgetown, Duke and Ohio State, visited
Education Secretary Richard W. Riley to
voice their concerr-. that the law could be
misused by states to go beyond financial aid
issues and politically interfere with university policies. Dr. Atwell, president of the universities' lobbying groups, warned in a recent newsletter of the possibility that "we
will seek legal redress."
Dr. Longanecker believes the law would
survive a legal challenge; but he also knows
what a legal challenge can do to enforcement. "The law is unambiguous," he said.

Lobbying by PoUticians
Mighty Friends
For Weak Schools
Hardly a day goes by when someone does
not seek extra consideration from Dr. Longanecker, Deputy Secretary Madeline M.
Kunin or Secretary Riley — sometimes the
very people preaching fiscal control. "The
phone rings the minute you clamp down,"
said Ms. Kunin.
Senator Levin of Michigan sits on the Senate subcommittee that itas been exposing the
regulatory failures in the Education Department's sludent aid programs since 1990. On
Oct. 5, three weeks before the panel's most
recent hearings. Senator Levin held a lengthy
meeting with Secretary Riley about keeping
Jordan College eligible for Federal aid. Ten
days after the hearings, on Nov. 6, the Senator convened a meeting in his office with Dr.
Longanecker and top education staff members on behalf of Jordan.
In 1991 and '92, Senator Levin won assurances from the Bush Administration that it
would keep Jordan eflglble, and in an Oct. 6,
1993, letter to Secretary Riley, Senator Levin
sought similar assurances, asking "no adverse proceedings against Jordan" be initiated.
Education officials say Jordan would probably have been barred from aid programs
years ago if not for Senator Levin's efforts.
The Department' has calculated Jordan's
most recent annual default rates as 35 percent, 51.7, 46, 58 and 46. Jordan has appealed
the two most recent rates.
Senator Levin's letter to Secretary Riley
says that for 1991-'93, "the college balanced
its operating budget." Dr. Longanecker says
recent department reviews show Jordan
"running a very substantial deficit." He
adds, "Without doubt it's a marginal institution."
j _
Education regulators want Jordan to post
a $3 million bond to guarantee the $6 million a
year in aid it receives. Senator Levin asked
Secretary Riley to reduce the sum to
$300,000.
Worthy Cause, Weak Financing
Senator Levin stresses the good record
that Jordan graduates have in finding jobs.
Recent Federal audits mdicate graduation rates between 7 and 25 percent for various
programs.
When asked about Jordan's accreditation.
Senator Levin answered, "My understanding
is that it's been accredited."
Jordan is not accredited, according to Dr.
Steven Crow, deputy director of North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.
Senator Levin says this is a school with a
mission to help the disadvantaged; where 60
fiercent are poor, minority students, many
single mothers. "You can't treat a school like
this nonprofit as a profit-making school," the
Senator said. "Suff has mortgaged its own
houses, not taken salaries at umes to carry
: out an idealistic mission."
Dr. Longanecker sa^sr Jordan's leaders
appear to be "principled, well-meaning folks
having a difficult time bringing their ideas
into practice." He also says he has a responsibility to taxpayers and students whose education may be jeopardized if a school is not
financially viable. And he notes that other
-nearby public collegeS'SefVe poor and minority students and are vtable.
Last December, after more meetings with
Senator Levin's staff, Dr. Longanecker gave
Jordan another exteniioh, 60 extra days to
respond to Federal flfKUtbrs' latest review.
The college is trying to fafse $3 million from
eight corporations to enhance its financial
stability; Jordan's president, Lexie Coxon,
said she got the first company to commit last
. Friday.
"The Secretary thinks a great deal of

�Business Groups and Labor Unions Attack Clinton on Health Plan
By ROBERT PEAR
Spprlil io I t * New York Timet
WASHINGTON, Feb 3 - President
Clinton came under fire from opposite
ends of the political spectrum today as
the United States Chamber of Commerce Joined the Business Roundtable
in opposing his health plan, while liberal lawmakers and labor unions complained that the President was too willing to make concessions.
Roberi E. Patricelli, head of the
chamber's health committee, told Con-j
gress that the business group could not]
support Mr. Clinton's health care bill
because "It proposes such a burden ofj
high employer premium contributions,
rich benefils and counterproductive
regulation."
Even as business groups stepped up,
their criticism of Ihe C Inton plan, a
coalition of 29 labor unions, consumer
organizations and liberal advocacy
groups sent a letter to the President
asserting that he was overly eager to
compromise on "fundamental principles of health care reform."
Today s developments Illustrate the
political problems facing President
Clinton as he struggles to fulfill a campaign pledge to guarantee health Insurance for all Americans. There is broad,
deep support for many of the President's objectives, but the support for
Hie specific intricate mechanism of his
proposal appears (o be exceedingly
thin
Moving to Open Criticism
Business groups and medical societies that maintained a neutral public
stance last year, while quietly trying to
Influence the White House behind the
scenes, are now openly criticizing the
Clinton plan, saying it would give far
loo much power to Govemment.
Liberals and labor unions that embraced the President's plan as a means
to universal coverage, Including some
groups that preferred a Governmentfinanced program of national health
Insurance, now express concern that
Mr. Clinton seems to be drifting away
from his natural allies on this Issue.
Mr. Patrlcelll's comments were
more negative today than when he testified before Congress In October. He
said then that "all employers should
provide and help pay for Insurance"
for their workers. But in an Interview
today, Mr. Patricelli, the chairman of
Value Health Inc., said, "After a year
of working wtth the Administration^ we
reluctantly concluded that we had to
oppose the President's bill." Value

Signers of the letter Include the
American Federation of State, Couniy
and Municipal Employees, the League
of Women Voters, the Communications
Workers of America, Consumers
Union, Citizen Action, the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters and the
United Automobile Workers.
Liberal Democratic co-sponsors of
the Clinton bill, Including Senators
Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio and
Tom Harkin of Iowa, have said they
share some of the concerns expressed
by these groups.
Senator Paul Wellstone, sponsor of ai
proposal for Government-run health
Insurance, said the President was go
Ing too far in trying to placate businesses. Specifically, the Minnesota Democrat said Administration officials were
making a big mistake by suggesting
that the White House might let compa
nies with fewer than 5,000 workers run
their own health plans, bypassing the
alliances. Such a concession, Mr. Well
stone said, "dramatically undercuts
our ability to achieve universal coverage and meaningful cost controls."
The chamber represents ' tore than
215,000 businesses, Including many
small and medium-size companies. Its
announcement comes one day after the
Business Roundtable, which represents about 200 of the nation's largest
companies, struck a blow against Mr.
Clinton's health plan by endorsing a
more modest proposal sponsored by
Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat
of Tennessee.

Ms. Hurwlt added: "We don't see

health care by agreeing to those
changes."
Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, employers would have to pay at least 80
percent of the premiums for Insurance
providing comprehensive medical
benefits to their workers. Mr. Patricelli, speaking for the Chamber of
Commerce, said that his group had not
categorically rejected the Idea of such
an employer mandate, bul that the one
proposed by Mr. Clinton was unacceptable.
Mr. Patricelli said he feared that the
employer mandate would "overwhelm

the employer mandate would wipe out

But Bruce C. Vladeck, the head of the
Federal Health Care Financing Administration, said that elderly people
would fare much better under Mr. Clinton's proposal than under alternatives

Sense of Relief, and One
Of Betrayal, Are Evoked
By TIIM WEINER
Special 10 The New York Times
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 — For some,
the announcement of economic coexistence with Vietnam was greeted with a
sense that, finally, peace was at hand.
For others, it seemed a final betrayal
by the Governmenl.
Bitterly denouncing the President's
decision were some former prisoners
of war and those who believe American
troops listed as missing in action may
still be alive. They said any accommodation with Vietnam would be wrong
until a final accounting.
"All of us who were held as P.O.W.'s
in Vietnam know first-hand that there
are no limits to what the Vietnamese
will do to show they are 'cooperating'
with the United States to account for
our missing comrades," a group of 70
former prisoners of war. including
James B. Stockdale, a retired Navy
admiral and Ross Perot's running
mate in the 1992 election, said in a
letter sent to President Clinton today.
In a fierce attack. Senator Bob Dole
of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, called the embargo's end "the
wrong decision at the wrong time for
the wrong reason."
U.S. Can 'Move Forward'
Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and a highly decorated
Vietnam veteran, said the decision
"guarantees we keep faith with the
veterans and families but that we continue to move forward."
"We have the most exhaustive,
painstaking accounting in place in the
history of warfare and I think we ought
to be proud of that," Mr. Kerry added.
But Senator John McCain, an Ari-
"It's time, you know — there is no
way to avoid it," said Thiep Le, who
fled Vietnam in 1979 and is now a
restaurateur m suburban Washington.
'Easier to Breathe' in Vietnam
"Depending on whether the Vietnamese Government can exploit the
opportunity positively, it will be a little
bit easier to breathe for the ordinary
people in Vietnam . If normalization is
coming in the near future, people can
go back and forth from here to Vietnam. My mother is still there, my
sister's still there, but I've dared not io
go back. In a few years, I can hope to go
and come back safely."
Truyen Swinger, a Vietnamese woman married to an American doctor,
said the decision made her "really
happy" and gave substance to her
dreams of starting a business in her
homeland. " I ' m thinking of opening a
sewing factory in Vietnam," said Ms.
Swinger, who runs a New York clothing
design and manufacturing firm.
For Mimi Tran, one of four sisters
who run Cuisine de Saigon at 154 West
13th Street in Manhattan, "there's a
sad side, but there's a happy side, too"
in the decision.
"There are lots of people who are
stranded in the refugee camps in the
Philippines — I don't think they can
gain entrance to the U.S. anymore,"
said Ms. Tran, who is 35 years old andj
came to the United States in 1968. "The
happy side is we hope we're able to
travel freely."
There is no such happiness for the

�THE
U.S. Plans
Expandec
Trade Zone
Chile Is Seen as Next
In Hempishere Bloc
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE
S(wy»l to Ttw New York Times
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 - The Clinion Adminislration is drafting a plan
that would create a Western Hemisphere free trade zone in 10 to 15
years and, as a first step, add Chile to
the North American Free Trade:
Agreement by late next year. Administration officials said today.
The plan not only responds to clamoring by Latin American countnes to
join the North American free trade
club that now includes Mexico, but
also recognizes that removing trade
barriers can be a boon for Washington because the Latin American region is an enthusiastic, fast-growing
market for United States exports.
With trade rather than aid as the
centerpiece of his Administration's
Latin policy, President Clinton is likely to unveil the free trade plan at a
meeting of 34 of the hemisphere's
leaders that is tentatively scheduled
for the spring, Administration officials said. The plan, some officials
say, could dominate the hemisphere's
economic and political agendas in the
next decade.
American policy makers say many
details remam up in the air. For
example, they have not decided
whether the hemispheric trade zone
should be put together by adding one
country at a time to the North American Free Trade Agreement or by
adding clusters of countries, like the
Andean group of Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.
A Vision First, Washington Says
Whatever is ultimately decided, the
important thing, Administration officials say, is to provide Latin and
Caribbean countries with a road map
detailing what steps they must take
— like deregulating their financial
markets — to quality' for the free
trade zone.
"It's imponant to articulate a vision," a senior official said, adding,
"and when we do that, we need to
make sure other countries will see
some light at the end of the tunnel."
With many Latin American countries forming small regional trade
zones with three, four or five members, American officials say it is up to
Washington to be the catalyst to weld
these smaller zones together mto a
single tariff-free market of 750 million people.
Administration officials sav it is
cenain that Chile will be the next
country allowed to join the North
I American trade accord. Negotiations
' with Chile are expected to begin this
spring, with some officials predicting
that it will be admitted to Nafu' 15 to
18 months later.
Some officials argue that the Administration should not rush ahead
with an expanded regional free trade
plan because its trade team has its
plate full with carrying out the North

American Free Trade Agreement,
getting the new world trade pact ratified, and resolving disputes with Japan and China.
But others say that the meeting of
Western Hemisphere leaders that
Mr. Clinton is organizing will fall on
its face unless he offers Latin and
Caribbean leaders what they want —
a vision and a detailed plan of how
hemispheric free trade can be built.
"All these countries are waiting for
some leadership from the United
States on how to proceed on this
whole process," said Renato Tovar, a
senior trade official with the Organization of American States.
United States officials are looking
at three ways to form a hemispheric
free trade zone.
First, one by one. Countries would
negotiate one at a time with the Nafta
members, the United States, Mexico
and Canada. Chile, which has progressed furthest on market reforms
and bringing down inflation, would be
admitted first.
Then, Administration officials see
y a second group entering three tp five
' years later: Argenuna^Colcrmbia,
Venezuela, Cosu Rica and perhaps
Bolivia. Brazil, with more than 150
million people, could be part of this
second group if it seriously attempts
market reforms and anti-inflation
measures.
The other Latin nations might join
in a decade or so, assuming that they
do more to deregulate their economies, reduce inflation and otherwise
make themselves more competitive.
Working With Existing Blocs
The second approach would be to
organize cluster by cluster. Regional
free trade groups like Mercosur —
which consists of Brazil, Argentina,
Uruguay and Paraguay — would negotiate to enter all at once. Other such
regional organizations include the
Andean Group, the Caribbean naiions
and the Central American Common
Market. Some officials say it would
be awkward negotiating with such
groups, but they think this approach
could be effective in pushing several
nations at once to undenake marketoriented changes.
Finally, there is the building-block
approach. AU. the regional trade
groups would take coordinated steps
to harmonize their economies, with
the goal of creating sufficienrcohesiveness to allow for a trade zone.
Among the suggested steps would be
adopting similar product standards,
investment and intellectual-property
rules, and setting minimal environment and labor standards.
"All this is not going to happen
overnight," said Jeffrey Garten, Under Secreury of Commerce for International Trade. "It is not going to be
easy for many countries to meet our
thresholds for qualification."
In both the United States and Latin
America, there could be a backlash
. against a trade zone. Unions and
some industries fought Mexico's joining Nafta, and opposition to admitting
other nations can be expected.
But Administration officials express confidence that the opposition
will be far less intense because these
countries are farther away than Mexico and do not seem to be the same
sort of competitive threat

WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (AP) —
Goldman, Sachs & Company agreed
today to pay a $250,000 fine to settle
allegations of Federal securities law
violations in the trading of United
States Govemment bonds.
The Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Goldman of prearranged purchases and sales of
United States Treasury securities
with Salomon Inc. and other brokers
in 1985 and 1986, mostly as a way of
accumulating losses for income tax
purposes. Securities law bars noncompetitive, prearranged
trades
without an element of risk.
The S.E.C. contended that Goldman
realized a total of $36.6 million in
losses as a result of the trades.
The S.E.C. complaint also accused
the investment firm of falsely recording the trades on its books as bona
j fide market transacuons.
|
i
Goldman settled the administrative action without admitting or denying wrongdoing. In a statement, the
firm said, "All the trades were done
: at prevailing market prices, and thus
the losses reflected actual economic
declines in ihe value of the firm's
positions in the securities it held."
Goldman said it had "fully cooperat-.
ed with the S.E.C.'s investigation."

�British Worry That U.S.
Is Slighting Them Now
By JOHN DARNTON
Special io The New York Time*
LONDON, Feb. 3 — There is a deep
wellspring of anxiety in Govemment
circles here these days. It comes from
I the fear that the United States no longi er cares about Britain.
This week's bout of jitters comes
! from the White House decision to grant
i a temporary visa to Gerry Adams, the
j Irish republican leader. But that is only
i the latest and most dramatic instance
| in what is seen as almost a yearlong
! series of slurs and slights from WashJ ington.
! British governments are accusi tomed to new American administrations coming into office infatuated with
the political throw-weight of the Germans or casting a covetous eye at
commercial possibilities in Asia. It
happened with Ronald Reagan and it
happened even more with George
Bush, according to Lady Thatcher's
memoirs.
But sooner or later, the thinking
goes, the Yanks will get in a tight spot
somewhere, maybe with a dictator like
Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi or Saddam
Hussein, or maybe in a dispute with
other European countries, and when
they need help for a little police or
diplomatic action, they will find out
who their real friends are.

Then they will come home again.!

Except this time, with the Clinton
Administration, it is not turning out
that way.
Things have even reached the point
where Prime Minister John Major has
trouble getting President Clinton on the
line. When he called to congratulate
him on the passage of Nafta in Novem
ber, a senior govemment official ad
mitted sheepishly at the time, he could
not rouse him. (Though some days
later Mr. Clinton called back.)
Now the two men who would seem to

On Tuesday, Mr. Major summoned
he American Ambassador, Raymond
ieitz, to 10 Downing Street to express
iis displeasure at the visa for Mr.
\dams, a diplomatic move virtually
mknown in recent memory. Though
here has been a flurry of communicaions through the embassies and
hrough the Foreign Secretary, Dougas Hurd — who was in Washington this
veek and had what a senior official
ere called a "lively" meeting with the
ational security adviser, Anthony
ake, who favored giving the visa —
ie two top leaders still have not been
\ contact to defuse the ill will.
J
,
The problem, said one person involved in the back and forth, is not that
"we have substantive differences" or
"hugely competing policies" on Northem Ireland. "The problem is that it is
an issue which means very little in the
United States, whereas on this side it
has tremendous salience," he said.
"It matters to the Prime Minister,
who is politically exposed because of
his joint declaration with the Irish Govemment," he continued. "It matters to
the press. It matters to Parliament."
And so, he said, in acting unilaterally
and against British wishes that were
clearly spelled out in advance, it was as
if Washington was saying "none of that
really counts to us."
An Opening 'Sour Note'
Relations with the Clinton Administration began over a year ago on what
an official in 10 Downing Street conceded on Wednesday was a "sour
note." He was referring to the discov- \
ery that strategists from Mr. Major's I
Conservative Party were working in;
the Presidential campaign advising the
Republicans.
Then there were news reports that
the British Home Office had agreed to
search through its files to see if there
were any documents on Mr. Clinton
from his years as a Rhodes scholar at
Oxford and an anti-Vietnam War protester. What was presumably being
looked for was any application to
change his nationality, which would
have instantly dashed his campaign.
There was even a report of an unfor-

tunate private cablegram sent on election day from Mr. Hurd, a seasoned
and patrician diplomat, to James A.
Baker 3d, whom he had come to know
well as Secretary of State. He used a
hunting metaphor to wish him good
luck: "May you bring down every duck
in the last flight of the shooL"
Does CUnton Bear a Grudge?
Now, British officials are wondering
if these ducks are coming home to
roost Is it possible, a top diplomat
wondered, that Mr. Clinton really bears
a grudge and enjoys sending little dans
in Mr. Major's direction?
They do not have to search very hard
to find a disconcerting pattern, including public statements from Washington that grate on Britain's sensitivities
by making it feel like just any other
country. Only three months ago Secreury of State Warren Christopher said
Europe was "no longer the dominant
area of the world."
At the same time Mr. Clinton gave an
interview in which he attacked Britain
and France over Bosnia and singled
out Mr. Major with an embarrassing
aside. Mr. V^jnr had confessed privately to him, the President said, that
he could not support lifting the Bosnian
arms embargo because his Government might fall if he did.
Mr. Clinton has met Mr. Major in a
one-on-one session only once, in Washington last Feb. 7, although they have
encountered each other at the Group of
Seven meeting in Tokyo and the NATO
summit in Brussels. They are scheduled to meet again Feb. 28 in Washingtoa
recent days both British and
American offlcials here have been quietly enumerating for reporters the list
of issues on which the two countries
have closely cooperated recently, from
coordinating efforts to secure a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
to policies on China and Russia and the
"Partnership for Peace" arrangement
with Eastern European countnes.
A Divide on Bosnia
Both sides have also pointed out that
a profound difference still exisu in the
approach to Bosnia. Britain, which has
2,300 troops on the ground there, opposes air strikes and the lifting of the
arms embargo, as does France. The
diplomats mention this as if to say:
You see, this is the kind of disagreement we should be having, and when
we do, it is not the end of the world.
But Ireland is different For one
thing, Britain has long regarded it as
an internal -matter and something the
United States should keep out of. For
another, Briuin-has long harbored a
fear that if the United States ever does
get involved, given the leverage of
Irish-American politicians in Washington, it might press Britain to move in a
direction that it does not want to go.
The fact that Senators Edward M
' Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts,
whose sister, Jeanne Kennedy Smith, is
now the American Ambassador to Dublin, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
Democrat of New York, were among a
group lobbying Mr. Clinton for Mr.
Adams to be admitted only feeds the
British insecurity. Both Senators are
essential allies if Mr. CUnton is to pass
his health and welfare programs, and
so the visa to Mr. Adams can be read
by the British as the triumph of domestic political considerations over the foreign policy value of having Briuin as
an unswerving ally.
Today's Daily Telegraph, in what
might have been intended as a calming

reference to show that there have been
ups and downs in the past, said the
dsipute over the visa was "the worse
rift in relations between Washington
and London since Suez" — a reference
to President Eisenhower's blocking a
British-led campaign to wrest back
control of the canal from Egypt in 1956.
Even an Anti-Thatcher Whiff
One Downing Street official, trying to
dampen the flames, tumed philosophical. "You're always going to have differences in tone between administrations," he said, recounUng the atmosphere in 1989. "There was a view in
Washington that Margaret Thatcher
had too much influence, and there was
a distinct whiff in the air of putting the
British back in their place."
Mrs. Thatcher's "influence," in addition to a personal chemistry with Presidents Reagan and Bush, stemmed in
part from her Government's actions in
1986, when she supported the raid on
Libya. She allowed American F-lll's to
fly from British bases, at a time when
France refused overflight permissioa
That is the way the special relationship — built upon a common language
and a shared culture and sense of national values — is supposed to work:
the United Sutes supplies the basic
firepower and Britam, the loyal sidekick, gets the diplomatic pins lined up.
One commentator noted at a dinner
table that while Mr. Clinton has traveled around a lot lately, he still has not
returned to the land of his post-graduate days. Perhaps, said the writer, who
ticked off three other former Rhodes
scholars in top positions in the Administration, sending people to school in
England did not automatically insure
that they would become Anglophiles.

Yeshivas Carry Political Punch Far Bigger Than Their Sizes
By MICHAEL WINERIP
Sptclat to I h t Nrw York T t m n
WASHINGTON - Last fall, when witnesses at Senate hearings testified about Hasidic
rabbis In Brooklyn siphoning off millions of
Federal student aid dollars from their
schools to enrich their religious causes here
and in Israel, It made news nationally.
But for old timers al the Education Department, this was not a surprise. Department
investigators had tried often in the last 20
years to bar many of these schools from
Federal aid, but at crucial junctures, dating
back to Senator Jacob Javits In the mld1970's, they were stymied by New York's
•Congressional delegation.
The New York Hasidic population has long
enjoyed political Influence beyond Its numbers. Its disciplined sects vote as a bloc and
"It's a big block vote," said Rabbi Morris
Shmidman. a spokesman for the schools. He
adds In recent years the support has gone lo
both Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a
Democrai, and Senaior Alfonse D'Amato, a
Republican.
And last year, both Senators wrote a letter
to Education Secretary Richard W. Riley
complaining that the Russian Immigrant students were being "traumatized" by departmenl Investigators making unannounced visits lo their homesi
Directors and board members of lhe two
dozen yeshivas that were the target of the
Senate hearings have also donated $125,000 to
candidates In races nationwide in the last
five years, according Federal election
records. Senalor D'Amato has received
$25,000, and Senator Joseph I . Lieberman,
Democrai of Connecticut, whose name also
appears on the letter to Secretary Riley, has
received $12,000.
Spokesmen for Senators Moynihan and
D'Amato say they were providing a constituency service. A spokesman for Senator Lieberman said the Senator had ndt seen the
letter before It was sent, but that when he
read it later, he thought it was "too strongly
worded."
The case of Sara Schenirer Teachers Seminary In Brooklyn, one of 21 schools suspended
from Federa) aid programs after the Senate
hearings last fall, Illustrates the long history
of pressure the Department has faced as it
has attempted to monitor aid programs.
In August 1974, the department's chief of
Institutional eligibility concluded that Sara
Schnierer seminary did not qualify for Federal aid programs. Then on Dec 3* 1974, a
meeting was held between several representative^ of the New York Congressional delegation and Education Department officials to
discuss Sara Schenirer Seminary and three
other yeshivas, according to departmental
memos. Two weeks after lhat gathering, the
department sent back Its review team to
Brooklyn to re-examine the four schools.
On Jan. 14,1975, the Department informed
Senalor Javits, Representative James Scheuer. Representative John Wydler and Representative Herman Badillo, that since "our
meeting" In December 1974, and after "careful consideration," the department had reversed Itself and certified the yeshivas for
Federal aid.
Mr. Badillo said yesterday he did not recall
the meeting 20 years ago. But he said such
meetings were "not an unusual occurrence."
"If a school was being removed," he said,
"we'd say, 'Check them out again.' "
Michael Goldstein, a lawyer for Sara
Schenirer Seminary said, "That's shocking?
A Congressman raises a question about
wheiher a school's fairly treated by a Gov-
ernment agency and something's wrong wllh
that? That's one of the purposes of a Congressman. Senior education offlcials agreed
with the schools and reversed the decision.
No more, no less."
Regulators Were Distressed
But Allstalr, MacKinnon, the New York
Education Department's longtime coordinator of Federa) programs, said he recalls that
the Intervention very much distressed Federal regulators at the time. The Education
Department made subsequent but unsuccessful attempts to ban Sara Schenirer.
Then in 1992, Senate irtvestlgators and
Education Department auditors and tried
again. It was not easy conducting an inquiry
among the insular Hasidlcs..
About the only people willing to talk to
Investigators were the elderly Russian Jewish immigrants who had taken (he courses
offered by lhe schools and were In many
cases not Hasidic. Investigators goi their
names from Education files and knocked on
doors.
A few examples of what Investigators testified they had learned in Ihose Interviews: the
schools "kicked back" $400 of the $2,300 Pell
grant to these students to Inflate enrollments
and attract more Federal aid; four schools
had received a total of six Pell grants for
Mahbuba Yekutlel, yet she could remember
attending only one; Sara Hoffman confirmed
her supposed signatures on several Pell
grant documents had been misspelled.
Rabbi Shmidman complained about (he
investigators to several Education offlclais.
He said the Immigrants who had come from
Communist countries were "traumatized"
by a Govemment agent showing up unannounced, though he conceded he knew of no
case wheen an Investigator used strong-arm
tactics or broke laws.. The rabbi wanted
Investigators to give two days' notice and
allow school representatives to serve as
translators for students.
On Jan. 7,1993, after a request from Rabbi
Shmidman, aides to Senator Moynihan and
Senator D'Amato held a meeting in Washington with the rabbi, a lawytr for the schools,
the two Education Departn ent Investigators
and their Washington supe.-vlsors. Again Investigators were asked by he rabbi to stop
the unannounced visits, bi t they and their
Washington superl6rs refu: sd.
On Jan. 21, after another request from the
rabbi. Senators Moynlhat. and D'Amato,
along wllh Senator Lleben ian and Senator
Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania,
wrote Secretary Riley questioning the department's "intransigence" on unannounced
visits and urging that Mr. Xlley review the
policy. The Senators said they were not trying to protect any schools violating rules, but
urged this be a "first order of business" for
Ihe new Secretary. (Senator Specter signed
Ihe letter afier a request from Senator Moynihan's staff, According to an aide.)
On Feb. 16, Secretary Riley wrote the four
Senators explaining that spontaneous Interviews were merited because of (he seriousness of accusations. He also pointed out It
was not Just Education Department auditors
doing the inquiry; it was also investigators
from the Senale's Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations. Senator Lieberman is a
member of that panel.
Spokesmen for the four Senaiors say (hat
after Mr. Riley's leiter, the senators took no
further action on the schools' behalf. At the
October hearings, Sara Schenirer Seminary
was *ne of two yeshivas most often crld*'
cized; last month it was suspended from
Federal student aid program. It has appealed.

handled for Mao Zedong by Deng

Ihe Soviet Invasion of Hungary In 1956.

"I,ike everylhin^ else." [oreign
Minisler Shimon Peres said, ' lhe
economy is a mailer of psychology."
And Ihe psychology of peace, he said
— Ihe belief Ihal (he conflict between
Israel and its neighbors is at last
coming to an end — has sel off an
Israeli economic boom.
"Israel is going through one of Ils
best periods economically," Mr.
Peres told a press breakfast In Boston. " I t has 7 percent growth, I think
Ihe best figure in the West. The Impact |of peacemaking with the
P.L.O ] has been very positive."
Reports from tsrael confirm the
picture of a boom. Business people
(here, and investors, had reckoned
thai Israel could never be a real part
of the new world economy without
stability in (he region around It. Now
a stable region seems possible, and
investors are responding.
But what are the prospects for the
currenl negotiations with Ihe P.L.O.?
reporters asked Mr. Peres. The
breakthrough last September was
supposed to lead to a detailed agreement by December, but the lalks are
still going on.
iNTHONY LEWIS
y^The Economic Motive
"Most of the complicated Issues
are behind us," Mr. Peres said. But It
Is a difficult negotiation, involving as
it does "Palestinian dignity and Israeli security. And what we call security they call dignity."
He ducked a question about whether a final agreement could be reached
by next week. But whenever It was, he
said, ll could be carried out quickly.
The original target was for Implementation by April, with Ihe Palestinians then taking over administration
of Jericho and Ihe Gaza Strip.
Mr. Peres's lone was opiimistic,
more upbeat (han I have ever heard
him. He foresaw great changes In the
Arab world, wllh countries moving
toward more modern economies and
more open societies.
"Dictatorship Is a tremendous
waste of money," he said. "Only rich
countries can afford It."
Among the costs of autocracy he
listed censorship, the cutting down of
Individual enterprise, corruption and
the maintenance of the cult of personality. He said people everywhere
were less willing to pay the price, and
to live In misery, because they now
could see how others In the world live.
"What brought down the Soviet
Union was not a polilical party or a
mililary coup but the winds of Informaiion. And lhat Is happening everywhere."
One reason President Hafez al-Assad has moved, he said, Is that Syria
has an emerging middle class and
has young people who see television
ahd compare (heir lives with others'.
The other reason Is that the Soviet
Union is gone, and President Assad
needs neV; relationships.
" I wouldn't say that he's drawn all
(he necessary conclusions," Mr.
Readers of the Blhle might raise an
eyebrow al Mr. Peres's history, since
many passages celebrate mililary
victories Bul what matters Is the
attiiude of the present Israeli Government. "We must decide on our
destiny," he said, "and (he Palestinians on theirs."
He said Israel was trying to "build
a regional economy, one that will help
Arab countries even more (han us."
Israelis understand, he said, (hai pov-'
erty is destabilizing.
Mr. Peres meniioned one concrete'
example of regional cooperation that'
he said had already been agreed: a"
plan by Jordan, Ist ael and Egypt to
connec( (heir elecirical grids. That
could save (he (hree countries billions
of dollars in generating facilities because their peak hours of energy use'
are different.
The vision of peace may still
founder on the rocks of memory. But
the import of Mr. Peres's words Is
tha( peace has someihing stronger
than hope going for it now. That is
expectation. People on all sides will
surely struggle to keep alive the vision on which they have begun to
build.
D
i
Expectations of
Mideast peace.
Peres said; that must be tested In the
resumed talks beiween Syrian and
Israeli negotiators.
The problem for Israelis and Arabs
and everyone, he said, is the psychological one of adjusting (o a new
world. "People usually prefer io remember lhan lo Ihink."
He rejected what a questioner said
was strenuous opposition from some
Orthodox Jews to the idea of peace
with the Palestinians We are determined, he said, "not to become a
dominating nation — something we
have never been in history "
�On My Mind
A. M. ROSENTHAL
Bigots
And
Journalists
Time magazine has printed a news
story disclosing that fighting black
anti-Semitism by asking black leaders to stand against it is a way of
"enforcing racial correctness" and,
"it might be argued, is just another
kind of bigotry."
Yes, that is what Time actually
says. Page 37, issue predated Feb. 7.
In its news section is a story about,
how an anti-Semitic speech made by I
a "semi-obscure" spokesman of thel
Nation of Islam before just a "few
dozen" college students is made into
a big deal. It becomes pressure
against "black leaders across the
country," and that "rankles" with
"some" blacks. It comes at a bad
time for black-Jewish relations, says
Time, particularly In New York, always "fretting" about race.
Then the "news story" discloses
"how it works" — first the speech,
then the columnists A. M. Rosenthal
of The New York Times and Richard
Cohen of The Washington Post call
for black leaders to "repudiate" the
speech. Then the Anti-Defamation
League prints the speech in an ad.
Then black leaders, "feeling the
heat," begin the "ritual of condemnation and racial correctness." Got it?
Jews whip it up and blacks have tc
bow.
Journalistically, enough said ol
Time's staff writer, his assisting reporters and their assorted editors.
Professionally, the article is worth
noting simply as a warning to other
magazines, newspapers and TV news
programs:
This is what can come out when
"news stories" are allowed to cross
over into editorialization by choice of
words, angling and stacking. Politicization, distortion, ethical junk. So:
vigilance, all!
But the story also reflects something else: the sickeningly condescending attitude of so many whites,
and some blacks too, toward black
intelligence, independence, individualism and honor.
Not a word did Time print to indicate that it ever crossed its collectivized-joumalism mind that black leaders who denounced the speech really
might despise it, that maybe they
stood up because they liked that
stance in life.
Timeteam saw them simply surrendering to pressure. Time Wamer:
Could it be that tells more about the
story's perpetrators than about the
black leaders?
1
The speech brought black condemnation after it reached print in news
stories — real ones, TW. — the opinion columns clearly marked as such
and in the ADL ad.
But that's no plot, son. It is how
journalism exposes bigotry. What
would happen to America if journalism, other than Time, decided that to
point to bigotry was itself bigotry?
And that correctness bit — cute,
Time
prints an
exclusive.
but come on, team, those of us who
insist on fighting bigotry are usually
lifetime opponents of political correctness and its lifetime targets, as
surely know Time and staff writer.
On Feb. 3, the real Feb. 3, Mr.
Farrakhan slapped custard all over
Time's face. He himself showed the
importance of exposing bigots. After
black leaders denounced his aide and
his vicious anti-Semitism, Mr. Farrakhan fired the fellow and said his
language was "repugnant" But he
stood by the "truths" the said aide
spoke.
Since those "truths" were a foul
mess of religious and racial trash,
Mr. Farrakhan's weaseling moves'
me no more than his earlier announcement that he would play a
violin piece by Mendelssohn.
I hope that the-statements against
the viciousness of Mr. Farrakhan's
man by the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
members of the Congressional Black
Caucus and the N.A.A.C.P. lead them
to a public evaluation of the dangers
of the Nation of Islam itself. The
country needs a full African-American expose of how the Nation of Islam
injects poison into the U.S. by constant spewing of separatism, hate of
whites, Asians, Judaism, Catholicism
- and its atucks against AfricanAmericans who oppose it.
Already among some Americans
and in the press, there is a kind of
mumblemouthed acceptance of Mr.
Farrakhan and his organization. It
goes: Well, maybe he is an anti-Semite, end that's not nice, but think
about his good work among drug addicts and his speeches about biack
self-responsibility. You have to admire that, don't you?
No, we don't, not any more than we
admired Nazism's economic success
or Stalin's vacations for assembly,
line champions. Do we still have -to
leam that hatred stinks, even when it
perfumes its armpits?
Q
30
�A Delicate Balance on Korea
President Clinton has to walk a tightrope to
conduct nuclear diplomacy in Korea. In considering
military deployments to reassure South Korea, Mr.
Clinton must take care not to rattle a suspicious and
unpredictable North Korea.
His pending decision to dispatch Patriot missiles to the South has alarmed the North. True, the
Patriots, which defend against missile attack, pose
no threat to Pyongyang. But given their hit-andmiss record in the Persian Gulf, they may do more
to guard Mr. Clinton from assaults by hawks at
home than to protect air bases in South Korea. So
why rush their delivery?
South Korea's military also wants to shore up
its defenses with Apache helicopters and other
capabilities that could be used to attack the North.
Such deployments are unduly provocative. Why
give hard-liners in the North reason to derail the
delicate negotiations and keep building bombs?
The South Korean military cannot resist saberrattling. Seoul's Defense Ministry now says it intends to hold Team Spirit military exercises this
year, conducted jointly with the U.S., if the North
does not allow intemational nuclear inspections to
resume. U.S. and South Korean diplomats preferred
to reassure North Korea by promising suspension of
Team Spirit as an inducement for the North to allow
access to its nuclear sites.
For its part, North Korea is doling out access to
the nuclear sites in small doses because it has little
else to barter for U.S. diplomatic recognition, increased trade and other benefits. But further delay
and increasingly vitriolic threats to break off talks
are only sowing doubts about North Korea's intentions; it would be wise to deliver the next dose now.
Pyongyang promised Washington to admit international inspectors to all seven of its declared
sites, as often as necessary, to assure that the
reactors remain sealed and no nuclear material has
been diverted since the last inspection.
But regular inspections that would examine the
sites more thoroughly would not resume until highlevel talks are held with the U.S. And inspections of
two suspected nuclear waste sites in the North,
which could shed further light on whether it has a
bomb, remain to be negotiated.
The North has not yet agreed with the Intemational Atomic Energy Agency on procedures to
carry out its pledge. It says the I.A.E.A. wants to
inspect more than is necessary to assure continued
monitoring. U.S. officials say it is up to the I.A.E.A.
to determine what it needs to see. But is checking
the reactor core really necessary?
Mr. Clinton must be careful to reassure South
Korea without threatening North Korea. But those
in North Korea who want nuclear diplomacy to
succeed cannot expect Mr. Clinton to walk the
tightrope forever.
The Truth According to Ollie
Oliver North has just started in politics, and
already his words, have got more twists than a
snake's back.
Accused by one caller to the Larry King show
of having lied to Congress, he replied: " I didn't lie.
When I raised my right hand and took the oath, it —
all the American people were watching — I told the
truth."
Later, on "Face the Nation," he told the interviewer Bob Schieffer, "When I raised my right
hand. Bob, in that Congressional hearing that everybody watched on national TV for six straight days,
every word I said was the truth."
WeU, yes. But what was it that Mr. North told
the truth about? He truthfully testified that while on
the staff of the National Security Council he had lied
to Congress to conceal what later became the Irancontra scandal.
That mendacity, Mr. North said, occurred "in
an informal, off-the-record meeting" with House
Intelligence Committee staff, "a situation nobody
should ever have b-^en nut in." Mr Schieffer said he
was puzzled. How, he asked, would Senator North
ascertain the truth?
"What you ought to do is, if the Congress wants
to get the straight answers, what they ought to do is
bring people up there, have them raise their right
hands just like I did, and expect that they will tell
the truth. That's what I'm going to expect as a U.S.
senator. I think that's what they ought to do when
they want to get straight answers to things. We
ought not to have those kinds of informal meetings."
Get ready, United States Senate. No more casual exchanges with the Secretary of Defense. If he
does not have his right hand in the air you might be
getting one of those "informal" answers. Now
Washington has never been a hotbed of truth-telling,
but the idea that being unsworn is a license to lie
does represent a departure of sorts.
All this poses an interesting question for the
voters of Virginia, where Mr. North is seeking the
Republican Senate nomination. Should he be swom
before every campaign speech?

�Clinton Dazzles Students at D.C. School

In Shuvetta Bullock's world of dashed dreams and
broken promises, Bill Clinton did what many others
have not. He kept his word yesterclay moming and
showed up at her school.
Shuvetta leapt from her seat and cheered with her
370 schoolmates as the president strode down the
auditorium aisle in Anacostia's Kramer Junior High.
Then she began to cry.
The students whom Clinton was to address Uve
amid the web of despair he described lasl week in
his State of the Union Address. Many come from
impoverished, single-parent homes in neighborhoods where there is heavy drug trafficking and
much violence.
"He came; he really came," Shuvetta said, wiping
away the tears streaming down her cheeks.
Clinton had canceled his visit to Kramer last
week because he lost his voice. Many thought he
would never come.
He had arranged the visit because his Secret Service detail "adopted" Kramer as a Chnstmas gift to
the Clintons. The agents chose to volunteer their
time to the school, which sits between the Anacostia River and Minnesota Avenue SE, because agent
Danny Spriggs went there in the mid-1960s and
agent Rich Miller grew up a few blocks away.

Clinton urged the students to
stay in school, resist drugs, work
with the police to prevent violence
and take responsibility for their own
lives.
"I'm going to try to make your
streets safe, your schools better
and the job future better," CUnton
said. "But you also have to say, ' I
am going to do the most 1 can with
my life.' "
But for Shuvetta, as for many of
the students, it was Clinton's appearance as much as his message
that they will remember.
After his speech, CUnton stepped
off the stage and, in the style of a
polished talk-show host, passed the
microphone and took questions
from the teenagers. Then, shaking
hands, the president made his way
up the auditorium aisle, joking, hugging a few of the girls and, as 14year-old Jesse Wilson said, "talking
to us like we were regular people."
Shuvetta, 14, who knew two
teenagers killed near her house last
summer, said she already is trying
hard to stay in school so she can be
a cosmetologist someday.
But the kernel of CUnton's message that most impressed her and
her friends was his advice about
sex, Shuvetta said.
"Thi.'? is-SPJ ?. .sport," Clinton told
the teenagers, adding that the only
way to avoid dying from AIDS is
"not to get it."
The boys "should not go out and

He pleaded with the girls not to

�Qinton Lifts Vietnam Trade Embargo

President Calls It 'the Best Way to Ensure Progress on MIA Issue

Washingion Post SuH Writers
President Clinton yesterday lifted
the 19-year-old trade embargo
against Vietnam, saying that a thaw
m relations between the two former
enemies is "the best way" to ensure
progress in resolving the fate of
missing servicemen.
"I am absolutely convinced it offers the best way to resolve the fate
of those who remain missing and |
about whom we are not sure," he
said in a White House ceremony •
where he was joined by a number of
senators who served in Vietnam
and supported lifting the embargo.
Clinton's action goes against the
wishes of veterans groups, whose
leaders believe that the Vietnamese
have been slow in providing informa- '.

and who argue that lifting the embar- !
go would remove needed pressure.
Clinton's opposition to the war
while he was a cc'.?ge student and
his extensive efforts to avoid being
drafted gave added political sensitivity to an already emotional issue,
and the president took care yesterday to meet with veterans groups
before making his announcement.
The lifting of the trade embargo
with Vietnam allows U.S. companies to participate fully in a fastgrowing new market and allows
U.S. citizens to travel and work
freely in a country where the nation
fought its longest war.
The United States will open a

'. But Clinton emphasized that he

be clear," Clinton said. "These actions do not constitute a normalization of our relationship. Before that
happens, we must have more progress, more cooperation and more
answers."
He noted that "nothing we're doing today is irreversible" if the Vietnamese fail to make progress on
obtaining the "fullest possible accounting" of the fates of those who
remain unaccounted for. The official U.S. government figure is
2.238 servicemen missing, but the
vast majority of those are known to

Clinton said he acted because the
Vietnamese had made "significant
tangible progress" on four areas:
returning remains of missing servicemen and prisoners of war; resolving "discrepancy cases" in which
there was evidence that servicemen
might have survived; providing relevant documents; and helping obtain assistance from Laos on investigations along the Laotian border
with Vietnam.
Many American businesses,
which have set up outposts in Vietnam in anticipation of yesterday's
decision, have lobbied for the lifting
of the embargo and argued that it
put them at a disadvantage with

But while the Clinton administration has put economics at the forefront of its foreign policy, the pres1

stress that economic considerations
played no role in their decision.
Clinton said he had "no idea"
about the potential benefits for
Amencan business because, "1
thought it was very important that
that not be part of this decision."
Sentiment in favor of lifting the
trade embargo has been mounting
since the last months of the administration of President George Bush,
who hailed a "breakthrough" in Hanoi's cooperation on the MIA issue.
Throughout the first year of the
Clinton administration, reports
from U.S. military officials in Vietnam indicated that the Vietnamese
were being increasingly helpful and
expected some gestures of appreciation in retum.
But Clinton moved in cautious
increments, insisting that his only
goal was to ensure the "fullest possible accounting" for those missing.
In July, he dropped U.S. opposition to loans to Vietnam by international financial institutions such
as the World Bank. In September,
he modified the embargo to allow
U.S. companies to bid on contracts
financed through those international loans.
Then in the past 10 days, three
events removed the last political
obstacles to lifting the embargo.
First, the Defense Department
said a document from Soviet intelligence archives indicating that
Vietnam held 1,205 more U.S. prisoners than it acknowledged was not
correct.
Then the Senate voted 62 to 38
in favor of removing the embargo,
with six of the Senate's eight Vietnam veterans supporting the measure. And lastly, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown was cleared
of allegations that he accepted money from Vietnam to help get the
embargo lifted.
None of those developments
changed the minds of veterans organizations and family groups that
wanted to keep the pressure on Hanoi.

a House Ways and Means Committee staffer at the
time, has a copy of the only existing conference paper
about Senate amendment No. 564, which called for
dropping Joe's provision. The single sheet reads: "CONFIDENTIAL. Summary: The House bill authorizes payments to children under age 18. The Senate bill does
not." The line under "Cost" was left blank.
When the conference report was presented to the
House on Oct. 17, 1972, Rep, Phillip Burton (D-Calif.)
rose to praise the new program. "Thanks to Tom Joe,
this is now a reality," he said.
What Is Disability?
Joe's amendment became law without anyone addressing the obvious question: How do you define disability for a child?
Previously, disability assistance had been premised
on the disabled person's inability to work The purpose
was to make up for lost income. The bill creating SSI
defined a disabled adult as someone "unable to engage
in any substantial gainful activity."
But children don't work, at least until they become
teenagers. "It is ludicrous on its face to apply the same
standard to children." said Joseph Humphreys, a former
congressional staffer who worked on-the 1972 bill.
Humphreys called the 26 words "a punt by Congress"
that left regulators to decide what to do.
The meaning of Joe's 26 words—especially the
phrase "comparable severity"—has been controversial
ever since. Even today, Joe said, he doesn't know exactly what the phrase was supposed to mean.
In writing regulations, the Social Security Administration, which runs SSI, said an adult was eligible if his
or her disability appeared on a predetermined list of
physical and mental impairments. If it didn't, the adult
could still qualify by having a personal evaluation that
determined that he or she was unable to work.
The regulations treated children differently. They
had to manifest one of the listed impairments, such as
acute leukemia, chrome epilepsy or serious mental retardation. Because children generally don't hold jobs,
individual evaluations were not considered necessary.
In the early 1980s, the Reagan administration moved

ual analysis as adults.
To implement the high court's ruling, the agency
asked a panel of experts to settle the question: What is
the work of a child?
The panel's answer, in the form of new regulations,
is the pnmary cause of Nora Porter's complaints. The
new niles defined a child as disabled if his impairments
"substantially reduce" his ability to "grow, develop or
mature physically, mentally or emotionally and thus to
engage in age-appropriate activities of daily living."
These activities ranged from learning, communicating
and performing in school to interacting appropriately i
with peers and family members.
|
Social Security officials said the panel was seeking a
common-sense way of comparing children and adults. In
Porter's view, they failed. "Age appropnate is a fictitious standard," she said. "It applies to the perfect child,
and any deviation from that allows someone to apply for
a n d l i l c p l v h*> r W l a r P ' l H i c ^ l - ' ^ - i
James Perrin, a Harvard Medical School pediatrician
who helped develop the regulations, said Porter's cnticism was unrealistic and out of touch. He said physicians need some standard to assess a child's behavior.
"None of us can think about children without raising the
question of age-appropriate behavior." he said. "There's
no way of approaching children and adolescents without
thinking about that."
Victory Provides leverage
Stein's legal victory gave him enonnous leverage
over the children's disability program. According to
federal and state officials, he became the program's de
facto supervisor.
Stein regularly threatened to seek contempt-of-court
citations when he felt the Social Security Administration wasn't implementing the rules fast enough. He also
provided the news media with information of how the
agency's foot-dragging was costing hundreds of thousands of disabled children money that the Supreme
Court said they deserved.
One of Stein's most significant accomplishments was
getting Social Security to review roughly 450,000 cases,
dating to 1980, in which children had been denied benefits. This led to the 150,000 lump-sum back payments.
But not even Stein could do anything about the government's requirement that the recipients spend the money
within six months to remain eligible for the program.
Stein unsuccessfully tried to create an exception for back
payment recipients, calling the rule "Kafkaesque."
The rules legitimized and even encouraged shopping
sprees. In a case that both federal officials and program
advocates said was fairly typical, Beverly Smith of Greenville, Ky., received a back payment in 1992 of $13,000
for her 11-year-old son, who is hyperactive and was
deemed disabled under the new rules. Smith, who earns
about $8,000 a year sweeping up in a local bank, said she
was shocked to receive so much money at once.
She used the money to buy a car, a washer and dryer,
a refrigerator, a stove, a television, a $2,500 computer
and three jogging suits for her son, she said in a recent
interview. She also repaired her bathroom, leaky roof
and coUapsed hallway floor.
The computer, she said, has helped her son to sit still
for long periods of time for thefirsttime in his life. The
stove had to be fitted with protective glass doors because her son once started a fire in the kitchen.
Smith now receives a regular monthly SSI check
from the govemment for $446, in addition to Medicaid
benefits.
In other cases disability money—both the back payments and the monthly checks—has been spent on everything from medical expenses not covered by Medicaid to fanuly vacations. In some cases, families have
tried to avoid the spending sprees by estabhshing trust
funds for the children, but such arrangements are legally complex and prohibitively expensive.
The Social Security Adininistration does require an
\
accounting from the person who is entrusted with the /"*)
child's check. But the agency does not have the re- cr
sources to scrutinize spending on a large scale. A
guardian is suspended only if an egregious misuse of the
money is called to the agency's attention.
"When you get into programs like this," said Louis D.
Enoff, a 30-year veteran of the Social Security Administration and its acting director until July 1993, "if you
write something that's very, very tight, then you have
great difficulty. . . . You're going to have to follow up
family filed a lawsuit, charging that the govemment was
illegally denying benefits to Brian and other children.
As the case wound its way through the federal
courts, it attracted a vigorous and passionate advocate—Jonathan Stein, a legal services lawyer in Philadelphia. The legal counterpart to Joe, Stein saw the
courts as a way to extend benefits to the poor. He and a
colleague, Richard Weishaupt, took Zebley's case all the
way to the Supreme Court.
Stein spotted the logical flaw in the administration's
way of determining eligibility: The "comparable severity" test could not be applied to children unless the
methods of assessing disability in adults and children
were themselves comparable. Children deserved the
same kind of individual assessments that adults were
receiving, Stein argued.
A Supreme Court case often carries the expectation
that large constitutional, moral or social issues will be
addressed. The Zebley case, however, was framed narrowly: Had the govemment properly interpreted the
law? In 1990, in SuUivan v. Zebley, the Supreme Court

SOARING COSTS
GROWTH OF THE CHILDREN'S DISABILITY PROGRAM
T
he children's disability
program was enacted in 1972
as part of the Supplemental
Security Income program.
Payments began in 1976.
Recipients must have limited
income to be eligible. Two
examples:
• A single working parent with
one disabled child receives the full
SSI payment of $446 a month as
long as the parent's earned
income is less than $1,107 a
month ($13,284 a year). As
income increases, the SSI
payment decreases
correspondingly; if income
exceeds $1,907 in any month,
the famiiy becomes ineligible.
• A two-parent family with two
children, one of whom is
disabled, receives the full benefit
if its earned income is less than
$1,685 a month ($20,220 a
year). Partial payments are
available as long as the family's
income level is below $2,576 a
month. Above that level, the
family becomes ineligible.

gun control and stiffer penalties for criminals; they begged for more money for after-school programs and urged the lowering
of the age at which violent juveniles are
charged as adults.
They also engaged in blunt talk, chiding
their leaders for, in the words of one, "making a lot of talk and not much action."
"You talk the talk, but you have to walk
the walk," said Monique Malloy, a sophomore at the District's Eastern High School.
Fernando Mateo Jr., a 14-year-old who
gave his dad the idea for the foys for Guns
exchange in New York, urged the congressmen to "take off the suits, leam the language and come out on the streets to see
what it's really like."
When the hearing opened, subcommittee
chairman Rep. Charles E. Schumer (DN.Y.) made it clear that he intended to set
the stage for efforts to place more restrictions on guns. Schumer, a key force in passing the Brady law requiring a waiting period
for handgun purchases, was challenged by
more-conservative colleagues, who empha-

sized the joys of hunling and the need for
law and order and family values.
Most of the children's testimony focused
on their grief and fear—the fear of going
outside to play, and even of going to school.
Janea Wells, a ninth-grader at the District's
Fletcher Johnson School, said she never
leaves her house alone.
Janea began treatment for post-traumatic
stress syndrome at the Hillcrest Children's
Center after seeing a 17-year-old friend die
in a hail of bullets during a drive-by shooting.
"1 would like to move away from this
neighborhood, but right now my mother
doesn't have enough money to move," she
said.
Rep. Craig A. Washington (D-Tex.) said
he is often disappointed that students in
schools he visits seem to ignore the advice
of elders.
In response, Monique told him: "So many
people are going to schools to (alk to get
the news publicity. But then the cameras go
away and they don't do anything."
Washington said later that "children have
a way of cutting through the bs and getting
lo Ihe cold, hard facts."
Some of the young witnesses lingered in
Ihe room long after the hearing was over,
seeming to need time to gain composure
and strength before leaving.
Zoe Johnstone, who had testified about
her father's slaying, sat in the now nearly
empty room crying. Janea Wells, who lives
in a tough neighborhood off Pennsylvania
Avenue SE in the District, sat down next to
the young girl from an upper-middle-class
neighborhood in Staten Island, N.Y., and
lightly touched her shoulder.
That gentleness did not pervade every aspect of the morning's hearing. The divisiveness of the crime issues that will come before
the Congress this legislative session were
clear in the remarks of committee members.
In his opening statement, Schumer attacked the American Shooting Sports Council's "Fly-In," in which gun induslry representatives this week came to town to lobby
against passage of any more gun control
measures.
"For the last three days, these adult gun
pushers have been twisting arms in their
silk suits and Gucci shoes," Schumer said. "1
invite those lobbyists to look these children
in Ihe eye."
Rep. Lamar S. Smith (R-Tex.) retorted
that the focus be kept on punishing criminals. "No matter how many times we beat
up on law-abiding citizens, we aren't going
to reduce Ihe crime rate."
The industry group, meanwhile, held a
news conference at the same time as the
hearing, and executive director Richard J.
Feldman argued that the gun control debate
is "unnecessarily divisive, distracting and irrelevant." The $24 billron-a-year industry
provides hundreds of thousands of jobs, he
said, protects lives and offers recreation for
individuals and families.
\ At the hearing, Rep. Dan Glickman (DKan.) mentioned his bill to make it a crime
for anyone younger than 18 to possess a
handgun.
Rfep. Steven Schiff (R-N.M ), who was
the 'American Shooting Sports Council's
breakfast speaker yesterday, called Clickman's bill "another cruel hoax" because the
federal government virtually never prosecutes juvenile cases.
The children, seemingly unaware of the
rancor, proposed their own solutions.
Monique said the Washington Area Boys
and Girls Clubs turned her life around, and
she criticized funding cuts. Janae said she

noting that the gun that killed her father

But Minister Defends 'Truths'in Speech
By Lynne Duke
A T
WjJimpon Posi SUH Wntn T / /
Responding to mountmg criticism that has strained his already fragile relationship with
other African American leaders,
Minister Louis Farrakhan of the
Nation of Islam yesterday denounced a top aide for making
"vile" and "repugnant" remarks
about Jews and others.
In a Washington news conference, Farrakhan said he had
stripped the aide, Khalid Abdul
Muhammad, of his title and rank
within the Nation after he had
concluded that a speech Muhammad made last November
was "not consistent" with his
teachings or those of the Nation.
In the speech, Muhammad
said Jews were "sucking
[blacks'] blood on a daily and
consistent basis," and suggested
the Holocaust may have been
justified. He used a series of
denigrating phrases to describe
Catholics, whites and homosex_ uals, as well as Jews.
"I found the speech, after lis- j
tening to it in context, vile in •
manner, repugnant, malicious, ;
mean-spirited and spoken in
mockery of individuals and people, which is against the spirit of
Islam," Farrakhan said. "While I
stand by the truths that he
spoke, 1 must condemn in the
strongest terms the manner in
which those truths were represented."
He did not detail the "truths"
he was referring to, but said
they were the teachings of the
Bible, the Koran and of "the i
Honorable Elijah Mohammad,"
the late founder of the Nation of
Islam.
Farrakhan also accused the
Anti-Defamation League (ADL),

"anti-black," and said it was attempting to drive a wedge beFARRAKflAN, From Al
tween Farrakhan and other black

remarks in full. Mfume said he welcomed the rebuke and dismissal of

urged an end to the "incredible pam
and heartache" caused by the episode.
While saying that Farrakhan
went beyond people's expectations
with his rebuke of Muhammad, Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), the D.C.
delegate to Congress, added that
Farrkhan had made "remarks, however, that continued to raise questions."
Said Rep. Charles E. Schumer
(D-N.Y.), "If he just would have repudiated Muhammad, that would
have been okay. But the man seems
incapable of steering away from the
path of bigotry."
The Farrakhan news conference
was the climax of weeks of controversy that began with Muhammad's
November remarks. On one level,
the debate is about anti-Jewish sentiments made in the name of a
prominent black organization, the
Chicago-based Nation. But that debate also has exposed the resentment that many promment blacks
feel at being held responsible for
the sutements of other blacks,
while they believe that whites are
not similarly held responsible for
statements made by other whites.
Before the battery of television
cameras and scores of reporters
who packed the ballroom of the
Washington Vista Hotel for his
news conference, Farrakhan lashed
out at other black leaders, whom he
did not name, for attempting publicly to "correct" him.
•To the black leaders: what happened to our agreement that if we
had any criticism of one another
that we would call each other and
go behind the door and speak frankly and candidly to one another? Why
could not I have been spoken to and
a meeting arranged with me to discuss this issue and how we should
handle it so that this issue would
not be allowed to fracture our budding relationship...."
"Correcting one another in public
for the purpose of currying favor
with oiir enemies is repugnant," he
said.
Farrakhan called on African
American leaders and their organizations to reconsider their relationships with the ADL and invited
them to hold a "private" summit
with him to discuss this latest chapter m an already difficult relationship.
Mfume has called on whites to
denounce Sen. Emest F. Holiings
(D-S.C), who last month joked that
Africans attend international trade
conferences so they can "get a good
square meal" rather than "eating
each other." Holiings said yesterday

�A-Arms Pact
Is Approved
In Ukraine
THE f
*sm»cTW POST FKHUY, FtnttAKY 4,1994
Legislators Reject
Key Related Treaty
By Robert Seely
Special io The Wjshinpon Post
KIEV, Feb. 4—Ukraine's fractious parliament took a major step
toward surrendering its inherited
Soviet nuclear weapons today by
endorsing the trilateral Moscow nuclear disarmament accord and ratifying unconditionally the START I
arms control treaty.
At the same time, however, the
450-member legislature failed by
about two dozen votes to approve
Ukraine's entry into the intemational nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, which binds signators to eschew all nuclear weapons. Political
analysts said the apparent contradiction reflects the continued fear
among a stong bloc of nationalist
legislators that such a commitment
would leave the newly indpendent
nation open to intimidation by its
nuclear-armed neighbor, Russia.
Legislative leaders said they
hope to schedule another vote on
the non-proliferation pact within a
few weeks. Meanwhile^it was not
clear if the legislature's failure to
approve the treaty would delay implementation of the Moscow accord—signed last month by the
presidents of Ukraine, Russia and
the United States—which requires
Ukraine to surrender its 1,800 nuclear warheads in return for financial compensation and comprehensive security guarantees from Moscow and Washington.
Nevertheless, the first two votes
were seen by political analysts here
as an important victory both for
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk—who had failed repeatedly in
the past to persuade the parliament
See KIEV, A23, CoL 1
KIEV, From Al
to commit itself to nuclear disarmament—and for tbe Clinton adminstration, which viewed the Ukrainian
arsenal as a serious destabliliang factor in the region and had made their
dismantling a key feature of White
House foreign policy.
In Washington, the State Department reacted cautiously to the legislative action. Spokesman Michael
McCurry said the reports sounded
like "good news" but that he would
reserve further comment until he
looked at the text of the parliamentary documents.
Kravchuk's senior foreign policy
spokesman. Anton Buteiko. called the
votes "an important step. . . that wil!
speed the beginning of real disarmament. But the president's proposal
was not fully accepted: we are not entirely satisfied."
The most important thing, said
Valentyn Lemish, head of parliament's defense committee, "is that
the govemment has been given the
nght to implement START I without
conditions; the next step is for
Ukraine to join jthe Non-Proliferation
Treaty]."
Parliament voted originally to approve the START I treaty last November, but added such crippling
condiuons to that measure as to
make its passage meaningless. Most
of those conditions—13 in all—were
demands for airtight territorial guarantees from Russia and the Umted
States; intemational inspections and
Western technical assistance as the
weapons were being dismantled in
Russia; full compensation for the
valuable uranium in the warheads;
and additional economic measures to
help Ukraine buttress its shattered
economy.
At the same time—under terms of
the U.S-Soviet START I pact and
clarifications covenng Soviet successor states—parliament estimated
that its treaty obligations required
dismantling of less than half its nuclear arsenal, while Kravchuk has always maintained that the language of
a parhamentary resolution on the
matter permits him to make much
deeper cuts.
In any case, Krachuck has argued
smce the Moscow agreement that all
the concessions parliament had demanded in November were effectively satisfied by that accord and that
START I should be ratified without
qualification and further delay. In doing so today, legislative leaders said
that the Moscow accord did not also
require a formal ratification vote because it was not an official treaty, but
a procedural understanding among
the leaders of the three nations.
Kravchuk told the legislator > today
that Ukraine's future as an irxiependent state was threatened bv the
presence of the missiles because they
are still under the operational control
of the Russian milhan and ox;id be
construed as grounds for others to interfere in internal Ukrainian arr'airs.
Kravchuk also cited the po>>;bilitv
of a catastrophic nuclear accident as
the warheads grew unstable with
time, and he emphasized repeatedly
Ukraine's urgent need for the economic aid that approval of the Moscow accord would bnng. Among other things, he reminded the legislators, dismantling the warhead- would
bring Ukraine at least Sl biihon in retum of uranium reprocessed for civilian power production, large-scale
energy credits from Russia to help
the country stabilize its collapsing
economy and U.S. aid in influencing
intemational lending organization;, to
provide desperately needed financial
support.
Political analysts said parliamentary support for the Moscow agreement has been building in recent days
in proportion to growing legislative
fears for the integrity of Ukrainian
territory. Proponents of the accord
argued that the Russian security
guarantees enshimed in it would
forestall this.

�'Break-Ins' Hit
Huge Network
Of Computers
Internet's Managers
Act to Guard Security
By John Burgess
Wufettfun Pott SuH Wntn-
Tens of thousands of users of the
Internet, the global computer communications network, last night
were advised to change their security passwords following a rash of
break-ins to Internet computers
here and abroad.
The federally funded Computer
Emergency Response Team (CERT)
issued the advisory, saying that
thousands of passwords already have
been collected illicitly by people using advanced surveillance software.
The illegal collection may be continuing and accelerating, it said.
Authorized users of the Internet
must type in a supposedly secret
password when they link their own
computers to the network to send or
receive information. Anyone who
discovers another person's password
can enter the system as that person,
gain access to their confidential Qles
and destroy or alter them.
The security breach raises the
specter of larger ones in the future
as technology permits a more advanced "information highway," a
high-speed channel for video, sound
and text that the Clinton administration is promoting as a boon to the
U.S. economy and society.
"The highwaymen are taking over
the highway," said Eugene Spafford,
a computer security specialist at
Purdue University.
CERT declined to give details of
the incidents or to say where they
had occurred. Neither would it comment on whether people had used
the illicitly obtained passwords to
destroy information or cause other
damage. But it said it was sending
out software that

An official at Rice University in
Houston confirmed that that school
had been hit. The operator of the
See INTERNET, A7, CoL 1
INTERNET, Prom Al
campus's computer network began getting notice
from other Internet systems of unusual events
and cut off the university's network from Internet
on the night of jan. 23.
Investigators found intruding programs in several computers on the campus. To repair the
breach, they replaced more than 3,000 passwords, beefed up their computer security and repaired incidental damage.
"We're keeping our fingers crossed in trymg to
get things up and running," said Patrick Humphrey, a network operator at the university.
The incident was first investigated by reporter
David L. Wilson of the Chronicle of Higher Education, a trade newspaper. It also has confirmed a
similar event at Bard College in New York State.
Computer security specialist Spafford said he
had heard the number put at dozens in the last
several months.
The Internet serves an estimated 15 million
people worldwide. It allows people to use their
computers to exchange electronic mail, browse
through distant electronic libraries and transfer
pictures and sounds.
Operators of Internet computers have been reporting scattered break-ins for several months,
but the numbers had been viewed by many security experts as a routine hazard of running a network. Notable was Panix Public Access Network,
a New York company that serves as a "gateway"
to the Internet.
Computer security experts say the method of
operation in the cases cited by CERT, the Internet's secunty overlord, is similar. All are aimed at
large computers such as Panix's, which are wired
to the Internet 24 hours a day.
Individual users typically connect their home or
office computers to the large one by telephone
Unes and through it gain access to the network at
large.
According to Vint Cerf, head of the Internet
Society, a computer industry group, the CERT
advice on new passwords does not apply to passwords that people use to dial up that "gateway"
computer.
It applies only to passwords used by people
who. after making that first connection, then
"reach out" across the network and sign on to a
second machine. That second password travels
across the Internet when the person types it in
and is therefore vulnerable to interception.
The password-collecting software exploits the
9r»rne srw-fU-:'' "trap door" that a graduate student
named Robert Morris used in 1989 to paralyze
thousands of Internet computers. He sent out a
so-called virus program that repiicjtcc •.'.self and
spread from machine to machine.
In the recent incidents, unkno* n parties have

�Chamber of Commerce Opposes Clinton Health Plan
After GOP Lobbying, Group Withdraws Conciliatory Testimony Prepared for H
Wjslnnillon Posi Suff W n t m
In another setback for Clinton,
the National Association of Manufacturers and four other business
groups sent letters to Cooper, his
House cosponsor Fred Grandy
(R-lowa) and Sen. John H. Chafee
(R-R.I.) saying they "support" discussions among the three to draft a
health plan based on "market competition reform."
The movement against the president by the business community
has upset the White House and
prompted an internal debate over
whether Clinton should, as one adviser put it, "take off the gloves"
against the insurance industry.
Leaders of that industry played a
major role in the Business Roundtable decision to support the Cooper plan. Both Hillary Rodham Clinton and the president are considering launching verbal assaults on
the industry.
Patricelli, under questioning by
Rep. Fortney "Pete" Stark
(D-Calif.), said, "We have not rejected mandates out of hand—we
haven't found one yet in a balanced
plan" that would work. He told a
reporter, There might be some
conditions under which we could
support a shared responsibUity concept but we haven't seen anything
yet."

1
By Spencer Rich and Ann Devroy
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce
yesterday backed away from conciliatory testimony on President
Clinton's health care proposal and
instead became the second business
group in two days to publicly oppose
the administration's health plan.
The shift came after House Republicans launched an intense lobbying campaign on Wednesday,
when they and others received advance copies of testimony of Robert
E. Patricelli, a Chamber official
scheduled to appear yesterday before the House Ways and Means
Committee.
The advance testimony, which
was repudiated by Patricelli yesterday, stated that the Chamber accepts "the proposition that employers should provide and help pay for
insurance" for their workers but
said the required employer contribution should be "no more than 50
percent" of the premium cost, not
the 80 percent proposed by Clmton.
The statement was identical to
testimony delivered before the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee by Patricelli last Oct. 15
except for deletion of the word "all"
before employers, and a slight difference in the wording of the 50
percent recommendation.
But Patricelli withdrew the prepared testunony when he appeared
before the committee yesterday,
saying it was "not reviewed by me
and was inadvertently sent to the
committee by Chamber staff and
does not accurately reflect the position of the Chamber."
Patricelli said yesterday that the
Chamber could support some form
of "employer-employee contributions" or "shared responsibility" but
that he had not yet seen any acceptable plan.
"We specifically cannot support
the president's Health Security
Act," he said. Despite some good
elements, it would impose such a
burden "of high employer premium
contributions, rich benefits and
counterproductive regulation and
new federal and health alliance bureaucracy that we believe it cannot
even be used as a starting point for
committee markup."
The Chamber repudiation occurred only a day after the Business
Roundtable, made up of 200 of the
nation's largest companies, backed
a pay-as-you-go health care bill
sponsored by Rep. Jim Cooper
(D-Tenn.) that does not guarantee
universal msurance coverage. Clinton has threatened to veto any bill
lacking that provision.
Chamber statement, said yesterday
the "Washington staff of the Chamber" was ignoring the concerns of
busmess members across the nation
who opposed the Clinton plan and
was about to "sell out its members
for 30 pieces of silver," that is, access to the Clmton White House.
"That statement is completely
wrong and there is no basis of fact
in it; he has a very vivid imagination," said a Chamber spokesman.
"It's not the first time he has
claimed credit for something he
didn't do." The Chamber represents
215,000 companies, primarily those
who have fewer than 100 employes.
White House officials privately
expressed disgust at what one
called "the fourth position the
Chamber has had on these issues"
and denied they had tried to stagemanage the early testimony to offset the bad news from the Rounduble.
Boehner said House Republicans
were "shocked" and "outraged"
when they learned that the Chamber's initial version of the testimony
would specifically endorse "employer mandates," requirements that
employers pay part of the cost of
insurance for their employees. Boehner said he sent a letter to Richard
L. Lesher, president of the Chamber, sharply attacking the Chamber
for such a position and calling it unrepresentative of the Chamber
membership. Boehner and many of
THF WASHIMTTOW POST FIMKV,
those involved in the campaign are
longtime Chamber backers and
have voung records nearly 100 percent in line with Chamber positions.
Boehner said an estimated 30 to
40 House Republicans were contacted to call their local Chambers
and have them call Washington to
withdraw the earlier statements.
Chamber officials said yesterday
the campaign was not decisive, that
officials working on final testimony
Wednesday had received only three
calls—one from a Democrat, one
from a Republican and one from the
New Jersey Chamber.
This is the second time this year
the Chamber has run afoul of House
Republicans, normally their closest
allies. In the battle over Clinton's
original budget, the Chamber, after
three months of controversial neutrality, finally announced that it
would oppose the business tax increases in the president's budget
plan.
"We had a celebrated fight last
year over the principles we believe
in and we thought they were our
allies," Boehner said of that dustup.
"We thought we and the Chamber
had a long-held behef that mandating benefits violated those principles. When we saw the Washington
staff selling out our members again
so they could sund arm-m-arm with
the Clinton White House we felt we
had to stop it."

�Interior Dept. Official Resigns Under Pressure
By Ton Kenworthy
> fat SHI Wnur
V
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt yesterday
ended an awkward test of wills with ooe ttf the
department's tenior officials byforcingtbe resignation ai Bureau cf Land Management Director
Jim Baca.
Babbitt insisted that the removal of Baca from
one of the Interior Department's most sensitive
posts stemmed from a difference in management
styles and heralds no change in the Qinton administration's commitment to overhauling federal policies on grazing and mining on public lands.
"The reform agenda of this department remains absohitriy unchanged," Babbitt said in an
interview yesterday.
But Babbitt's action—which essentially gave
the outspoken BLM director the choice of resigning or beingfired—wasroundlydenounced
by many environmental groups and Democrats
on Capitol Hill who favor fundamental changes in
federal land management
Ousting Baca, a forceful advocate for stronger
environmental management of federal lands, will
have a chilling effect on the administration's natural resources agenda and on other department
employees, tbey said, and encourage greater retnce from Western industrial interests and
i
political allies.
"This is a major retreat for this admimstraUon," said Jay D. Hair, president of the 5.5 million-member National Wildlife Federation. I t
doesn't make any difference if you have Jim Watt
or Bruce Babbitt at Interior, the old politics of

G. Jon Roush, president of The WiWemess Society, called it "a serious blow to the Cbnton administratwo's credibility oo public lands reform."
Baca'sresignationcame a week after be first
declined to accept a new position as deputy assistant secretaiy offered by Babbitt. Babbitt's contmoed desire to replace him, administratioo sources
said, triggered a vigorous debate at the White
House. Vice President Gore supported Baca, but
the administration ultimately sided with Babbitt
As director at tbe agency that manages about
260 milbon acres of land in the West, Baca's
style—described as impolitic by senior Interior
Department officials—had angered some western
governors with close bes to the White House. Idaho Gov. Cecil D. Andrus (D) and Wyoming Gov.
Mike Sullivan (D) were particularly unhappy with
Baca, as were mining and ranching interests.
Babbitt's description of the change as aresultof
differences in style is "kind of bogus," Baca said.
"Frankly, this came about because those western
elected officials are worried about fund-raising
from those traditional extractive industries."
Babbitt yesterday launched an apparent damagecontrol effort following Baca's resignation, hoping
to blunt the widespread initial reaction that the
episode is another indication of tbe administration
getting cold feet on natural resource policies because of fears of a western political backlash.
Babbitt convened all tbe department's political
appointees for a pep talk yesterday and summoned
the heads of many national environmental groups
for two meetings afterward. The results were
mixed at best The several dozen political appointees, said one who was present, responded with a
stony silence to what wu described as a long
speech by Babbitt about his "wsjon for the WestMany of the people Babbitt recruited from the

will be emboldened to oppose land-use changes
and demand that other personnel be replaced.
Last week, for example. Sen. Malcolm Wallop
(R-Wyo.) said the removal of Baca would represent
the "first major harvest" from the Senate's defeat
ai Babbitt's attempt to overhaul graang policies

Appeals court nominee Rosemary
Barkett defended her votes against
severa] death sentences yesterday,
telling senators a judge should approach cases with neither hatred
nor sympathy toward a killer.
Barkett, now chief justice of the
Florida Supreme Court, is the first
Clinton judicial nominee to draw
notable criticism. She has been
nominated to serve on the l l t h
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
which covers Florida, Georgia and
Alabama. Her critics say she looks
for excuses, such as a deprived upbringing or low IQ, to let criminals
off.
"I do not look for ways to avoid
the law," she said at yesterday's
Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing. "1 only look for
ways to apply the law."
Barkett urged committee members to review her entire nine-year
record on Florida's highest court,
where she said she has been in the
majoriry 91 percent of the time.
Although some GOP senators
sharply questioned Barkett's opinions, the former Catholic nun of
Syrian descent was warmly received by most committee members. Barkett appeared confident as
she testified in a roomful of relatives, self-consciously catching herself saving "when I am on . . . " the
federai appeals court.
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.)
was among the Republican mem-
bers who criticized Barkett's votes
in capital punishment cases, detailing grisly Florida murders in which
she dissented as the court upheld a
death sentence.
Barkett said judges must consider not only the aggravating factors
that might warrant the death penalty but circumstances that mitigate
against it. She said she has tried to
make sure capital punishment is
fairly imposed. "It's the ultimate
penalty and cannot be corrected"
after it is carried out.
In response to questions about
whether she would be an "activist"
judge, making law from the bench,
she repeatedly said she would be
true, to the Constitution. A committee vote on the nomination has not
yet been scheduled.

Administration Unveils Plans
To Beef Up Border Control
By William CLaj borne
Wutiogloc Pou Sua Wnur
The Clinton administration yesterday
unveiled a new, $368 million border control
program to stem the tide of illegal immigration from Mexico by adding more than
1,000 agents and sophisticated electronic
equipment to the Southwest frontier.
The $368 million for fiscal 1995 will be
requested in President Clinton's proposed
budget on Monday and wtfl require congressional approval. It could get the support of
delegations from five large states with immigration concerns: Califomia, Texas, New
York, Florida and Illinois.
The proposed crackdown, part of which is
patterned after last year's highly successful
"Operation Blockade" in El Paso, also will
include efforts to deport illegal immigrants
who are in prisons on criminal charges, curtail the sale of fraudulent documents, revise
the asylum process and ease the path of
legal immigrants to this country.
Coupled with $172.5 million already appropriated for this fiscal year, the new
spending package will bring the cost of the
two-year border campaign to $540.5 million. It will raise the Immigration and Naturalization Service budget in fiscal 1995 by
22 percent, to $2.1 billion.
In announcing the initiative. Attorney
General Janet Reno said the adnumstration
is committed to maintaining the U.S. tradition of liberal inunigration policies. "But
we will not permit this cherished tradition
to be jeopardized by weakness in enforcing
our immigration laws," she added.
INS Commissioner Dons M. Meissner said
the biggest share of the package—$180 million—will go to adding 1,010 Border Patrol
agents to the Southwest by the end of next
year. Half of those will be new agents; ± s
rest, agents freed from desk jobs.
During the first year, a of the new and
U
redeployed agents will be sent to San Diego
and El Paso, where 65 percent of the arrests of undocumented immigrants occur,
Meissner said.
However, in a letter to Reno yesterday,
the four senators from Arizona and New
Mexico—two Repubbcans and two Democrats—complained that $45 million appropiated for 600 additional border agents this
year was being used only in Ei Paso and San
Diego, while their states are getting no new
agents.
In a separate letter. Sens. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) and Emest F. Holiings (DS.C.). chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that handles the Justice Department, complained that the expenditures "do
not conform with congressional direction"
and demanded that the Justice Department
submit a reprogramming request before
obligating the $45 million.
In addition to hinng new agents, the Border Patrol also will buy new mobile infared
telescopes, electronic sensors and secure
radios to help agents detect illegal border
crossings, install about five miles of lighting
east of the San Ysidro entry to California and
erect five miles of secondary fencing to block
entry onto highways, INS officials said.
Joining Reno and Meissner in a news conference was Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.),
who praised the initiative but said that at least
10,000 border agents—roughly 6,500 more
than are currently deployed along the 2,000mile Southwest frontier—will be needed to
effectively curtail iUegal immigration.
Meissner said that figure "seems very
high" but added that manpower needs will
be reevaluated after the INS assesses the
effectiveness of the additional 1,010 agents.
She said the new lighting and sensors will
have a "force-multiplying effect" and that
the budgeted number of new agents may
prove to be adequate.
Other members of the congressional delegation from California, where illegal immigration has burdened social services and
strained the state budget, hailed the initiative as a major step forward. Sen. Barbara
Boxer (D) recalled that Reno visited the San
Diego border last August, "looked the
agents in the eyes and said, 'Tell me what
you need.'"
Meissner said the initiative, in effect, will
put last year's dramatic immigration crackdown in El Paso on a permanent footing in
that West Texas border city and extend
some of its experimental blockade principles to San Diego, which has the country's
highest number of illegal crossings.
During
"Operation Blockade," 400
agents—four tunes the usual number—prevented illegal entnes along a 20-mile stretch
of the Rio Grande instead of attempting to
apprehend undocumented aliens who had already slipped into the country.
Arrests by border agents fell from 1,200 a
day in July to 50 to 75 a day in November,
INS officials said.
Reno said the initiative will double the
number of INS hearing officers and immigration judges to clear a backlog of 300,000 political asylum claims, step up investigations of
employers that traditionally employ illegal
workers, reduce the number of documents
that can be used to obtain work permits and
make it more difficult to counterfeit "green
cards."
Mario Moreno, Washington representative of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, commended
the initiative but said it will require "detailed scrutiny and continued dialogue to
assure positive solutions" to immigration
problems.

A co o a d Jn g es g Lxpa ded for ra sporta oi Workers
By Don Phillips
W^hmKltMi K^J Still Wnlrr
Transporiation Secretary Federico Peiia
yesterday announced widely expanded alcohol
and drug testing requirements lor truck drivers, pilots, railroaders and other "safetysensitive" transportation workers. The new
tests, which will begin next year, will cost the
industry $200 million annually and will affect
7.4 million workers.
"We are working to ensure that when you
board the subway or a plane, a tram or a bus,
Ihose responsible for your safely will have
strong incentives to be sober and fit for duty,"
said Peiia, who was ordered to consider new
rules in 1991 legislation.
The new regulations order that alcohol
tests, now required only after a railroad or
maritime accident, be administered on a ran
dom basis and at the tune of hinng, when »
supervisor observes suspicious behavior and
when suspended employees retum lo work
after rehabilitation. In some cases, post-accident testing will be expanded to other forms
of transportation.
Drug testing is already required under
those circumstances in some industries. But
under the new regulations, the 3.6 million
workers now subject to drug testing will more
than double as drug testing is expanded to
embrace more categories of workers, including school bus drivers, mass transit operators, intrastate truckers and any worker with
a commercial driver license.
Unions and industry officials objected to
the expanded regulations and argued that cur-
rent drug testing programs have found a minus* ule us*" ol drugs
The regulations did imlude some piovisions lhat will ease random drug testing requirements. The required number of random
drug tests would be cut from 50 percent of
the work force each year to 25 percent, as
long as the number of positive tests in an industry remains below 1 percent.
Random alcohol tests would be somewhat
less stringent than drug tests. If fewer than
0.5 percent of employees in an industry test
positive for two years, required yearly random alcohol tests would fall to 10 percent of
safety-sensitive employees.
Under the new regulations, an employee
with a blood-alcohol content of 0.04 percent
or more—less than half the legal level of impairment for motorists—must be removed
from service untd after professional treatment Workers with blood-alcohol levels betwet-n 0 02 and 0 04 must be removed from
duly temporarily.
All tests would be administered by companies raiher than govemment, and in most
cases, alcohol levels would be determined by
breath tests. No testing would Uke place in
wayside truck scale areas. The rules go into
effect Jan. 1, 1995, for companies with 50 or
more employees and the following year for
smaUer companies.
Unions and airline and trucking industry
officials objected to the rules primarily because the required number of random drug
tests was not cut to 10 percent, as they had
suggested. Unions also objected that rehabilitation programs were not required after a
worker is found 'o be impaired.
Transportation labor continues to believe
lhat mandatory drug and alcohol testing is
overly inlnisive and unconstitutional," said
Walter J. Shea, president of Ihe Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO.
John J. Collins, a senior vice president at
the American Trucking Associations, said it is

screening because a prospective employee
need only stop drinking a few hours.

rules. Edwin L. Harper, president of the Assxiation of American Railroads, said railToads "applaud the concept" of easing testing

Holding a Bible, Helms contended that lhe government was
banning it from being read in public
schools while "paying for condoms"
for students. "What kind of message
does that send?" he asked.
When Sen. Bob Packwood (ROre.) suggested adding the words
"constitutionally protected," which
Helms brushed off as implicit in his
proposal, the measure gained thesupport of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and other Uberals
who have favored funding cutoffs
for violation of other constitutional
rights, such as civil rights.
With that, it became easier for
many senators who oppose relaxing
constitutional bars against prayer in
public : ihook to vote for the Helms
proposal and avoid incurring the
wrath of school prayer advocates.
"I think it will have little legal
impact" but could cause local school
boards, especially those without
funds for good legal advice, to bend
over backwards in allowing prayers
to avoid possible loss of federal aid,
said Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.),
an ordained Episcopal minister, who
led opposition to the proposal.
As an alternative, Danforth had
proposed a nonbinding resolution
urging a "brief period of daily silence"
for contemplation that could include
"drawing strength from whatever
personal, moral or religious beliefs or
positive values they hold." Even
though the Helms amendment
passed, Danforth's proposal was
scheduled for a vote today.
In arguments against the Helms
proposal, Danforth contended it was
"pernicious and divisive" and tantamount to saying, "if you want
Washington's money, do things
Washington's way." The Senate was
saying "we really do have all the
answers" despite local views to the
contrary, he added. It was "a huge
hammer over local school boards,"
Sen. James M. Jeffords (R-Vt.) said.
The four Washington-area senators voted for the Helms proposal.

Space Shuttle Launch Begins
Era of U.S.-Russian Cooperation
V
By William Harwood
Sprcul to The Washmiron Pou
CAPE CANAVERAL. Feb. 3—The shuttle
Discovery, carrying the first Russian to Uke
off aboard a U.S. spacecraft, thundered into
orbit at 7:10 a.m. EST today, opening a new
era in joint space efforts that NASA hopes
will lead to an international space sution.
Twenty-five years after the Cold War
space race that spuned the first moon landing in 1969, the 60th shuttle launch was
marked by cooperation, not competition.
"I'm very glad to say that the time that we
have been rivals in space . . . is over," said
Yuri Koptev, chief of the Russian Space
Agency. "We are very hopeful that we will
leam a lot from each other."
The practical goals of Discovery's eightday mission are straightforward: To conduct
a batter.' of experiments in a commercial
Spacehab research module; and to launch a
commercially developed satellite that could
lead to faster computer chips ar.d other hightech electronic devices.
But the symbolic goal was accomplished at
liftoff when cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, 35,
became the first Russian to uke off on a U.S.
spacecraft.
The Russian Space Agency will retum the
favor m February 1995 by launching NASA
astronaut Norman Thagard aboard a Soyuz
rocket for a three-month suy aboard the Mir
space station. Thagard is to be returned to
Earth aboard the shuttle Atlantis after the
first of as many as 10 shuttle-Mir docking
missions.
NASA views the joint flights as critical to
the agency's plans to build an international
space station later this decade.
By making the Russians full partners in the
project, and by using the aging Mir sution as
a proving ground for critical systems. NASA
hopes to begin construction of its long-delayed space sution in 1997, earlier than otherwise possible.
Whether Congress will go along with the
plan, which would require NASA to pump
millions of dollars into the flagging Russian
space program, remains to be seen. Likewise, it is unclear bow ongoing political turmoil in Russia might affect that nation's
space program and iu commitment to the
space sution.
But NASA administrator Daniel S. Goldin
played down such issues, saying the U.S.
space sution will not be held hosUge by re
liance on Russia.
"Yes, there's turmoil in Russia," Goldin
said. "We had about 18 to 20 launches and
the Russians had 40 during tbe peak of their

Orbiting 220 miles above the Earth, the
Discovery astronauts spent their first day in
space breaking out cameras and other gear
and activating a battery of experiments inside the Spacehab.
On Saturday, astronaut Jan Davis plans to
use Discovery's robot arm to launch the
Wake Shield Facility satellite, a 12-foot-wide,
flying saucer-shaped spacecraft developed by
researchers at the University of Houston. If
all goes well, Krikalev will use the arm to
retrieve the satellite Monday for retum to

The goal of the satellite experiment is to
grow near-perfect semiconductor crystals
that could lead to computing devices "that
are at least four times faster than what we
have today," said University of Houston physicist Alex Ignatiev.
"You're lookmg at the ability, with better
material, to have some of the higher-end processors run much faster and come close to

said.

�Superintendent Says He Was Slow
In Naval Academy Cheating Probe
Admiral Testifies Before Senate Panel Probing 1992 Scandal
By Fem Shen
V
U.S. Naval Academy Superintendent Thomas C. Lynch accepted
responsibility yesterday for mishandling the school's investigation of
widespread cheating by midshipmen
on a 1992 exam, saying he received
inadequate information.
Rear Adm. Lynch acknowledged
for the first time that "in 20/20
hindsight," he should have taken
more seriously the initial reports
that unprecedented numbers of
midshipmen, including football players, had obtained advance copies of
the tough electrical engineering
exam.
"At the time, I thought it was
rumors and innuendo." Lynch said,
adding that he should have sought
an investigation by the Navy inspector general's office.
"I failed in that I did not bring
about" that investigation, said
Lynch, who testified at a heanng
before the Senate Armed Services
Committee's subcommittee on
force requirements and personnel.
Rumors of cheating by as many
as 133 midshipmen largely were
confirmed by the inspector general's subsequent seven-month investigation, conducted at the request
of Sen. Richard Shelby (D-Ala).
Vice Adm. David M. Bennett's report, released Jan. 24. found that
midshipmen, including athletes, not
only cheated but lied to officials and
colluded with classmates to protect
themselves.
The report also said that academy officials failed to act on allegations that the cheating was widespread, withheld information from
student-run honor boards and created an impression that they were
biased toward football players and
not interested in vigorously pursuing the truth.
Lynch said he was informed iniially that the number of students
making very high grades on the
exam was within the normal range
and did not signal widespread cheating. He said he was told early in his
inquiry that there was no evidence
of the football team's involvement.
See ACADEMY. D3, CoL 3
:
ACADEMY. From D3
Shelby, who convened the hearing after reading the scathing report, left the four-hour session yesterday with his initial conclusions
strengthened.
"It's obvious to me the investigation was botched from the beginning—initially it didn't go deep
enough or broad enough." said Shelby of the probe into cheating scandal, the worst in the school's 149year history.
Speaking to reporters after the
heanng. Lynch was asked if he
would resign. "I've been there two
and a half years, I know what
needs to be done and I intend to
stay there to get the job done." he
replied.
During the heanng, speakers
faulted academy and Navy leadership, tracing the embarrassing incident to a decades-long "drift"
away from the tradition of honor
and integrity at the school where
the Navy and Marine leaders are
trained.
Midshipmen "come in (to the
academy} with quite good values
and they leave with those values
chipped away," said Richard L. Ar-itutage, \?ho led a civilian panel that
reviewed the school's honor code in
the wake of the scandal.
It is too easy to simply blame the
scandal on the increasing level of
"moral relativism" in society. Armitage said. Such an explanation

leaders an easy way out," said Armitage, a 1967 academy graduate.
Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.)
was particularly incensed that the
ac.~emy brought retired Marine
Col. Oliver North, an academy
graduate, to the campus book store
in November to sign copies of his
book "One More Mission."
Byrd read from a message sent to
midshipmen through the academy's
electronic mail: "Come and meet
Mr. North and have him personally
autograph your copy of 'One More
Mission,' " a recollection of North's
Vietnam experiences and "a testimony to bravery and faith."
"Oliver North bed to and misled
Congress," said Byrd, who noted
that two other key figures in the
Iran-contra affair, John Poindexter
and Robert C. McFarland, also
were Naval Academy graduates.
Lynch said he approved the
North appearance because he
thought it would not endorse North,
but merely stimulate discussion of
North's role in Iran-contra.
"Did it ever occur to you that one
of the things you approved could be
one of the thmgs that caused the
cheating?" Byrd asked Lynch.
At Byrd's request. Lynch agreed
to provide the subcommittee with
quarterty reports on the academy's
progress in reinvigorating the
school's Honor Concept, which says
"a midshipman ooes not he, cheat or
steal."
The honor codes of the other two
service academies—the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y..
and the U.S. Air Force Academy at
Colorado Springs, Colo.—go farther, adding the words: "and wiD
not tolerate those who do."
The Naval Academy has always
resisted adding such a "non-toleration clause" to its code, but Shelby
said that, because of the cheating
scandal, he will push for the academy to adopt similar wording.

U.S. Adjusts Price Index to Correct an Aberration Early in Year

in inflation, were going up any faster
than tlicy had been. Nevertheless,
they came very close to raising interest Mles before Ihe monthly CPI gains
tapered off again.
That led both Ihe Fed and the president's Council of Economic Advisers
to ask HLS price experts to explain
why such a pattern occurred when
seasonal adjustments were supposed
to eliminate it. The index is routinely
adjusted for recurring seasonal ups

new models hit dealers' showrooms.

procedures will be applied for Ihe first
time to the consumer pricefiguresfor

HLS Feb. 17.
Since the changes should have the
effect of showing somewhat smaller
monthly CPI increases early in the
year, they could reduce the pressure
on the Fed to raise rates in response
to recent reports of strong economic
growth. A number of analysts have
been urging the Fed to move to reassure financial markets lhat it does not
intend to allow inflation to worsen.
The changes involve seasonally adjusting some of the components of the
index that have not been adjusted in
the past, BLS economist Patrick Jackman said.
None of the changes will affect the
monthly unadjusted index figures,
which are the basis of calculations of
annual inflation rates.
The CPI's problem pattern has
shown up in 10 of the past 12 years.
After that 4.5 percent rate of increase
early last year that almost triggered a
Fed move, core consumer price inflation later dropped back to a 2.5 percent rate. A similar but less pro-
nounced pattern is present in the overall CPI.
Two researchers at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank concluded
last fall that the pattern was misleading not just Fed policy makers, bul financial markets as well.
Using sophisticated mathematical
techniques to hold other factors constant, John P. Judd and Andrew R.
Biehl found that rates tended lo be

The Supplemental Spending Secret
Congress's Clever Little Disaster Dodge Worsens Deficits
By James K. Classman
Sprcul to T V Wilhmnton Pnt
Suppose you run a little hardware store on a
bayou in Louisiana. Four out of five years, the
bayou rises and floods your store, causing
about $20,000 damage each time. You can't
move the store (it's a nice spot), and no one
will sell you insurance. What do you do?
Simply budget $20,000 every year for
"possible flood damage," of course. If there's

Instead, when disaster strikes—as it indeed
has in four of the last five years with Hugo,

�Energy Department Plans to Overhaul
How It Buys Services, Runs Programs
Fixed-Price Contracts, Other Reforms Aimed at Ending Years of Waste
By Stephen Barr
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary yesterday announced
substantial changes in the way her department buys services and manages programs, pledging that she no longer would wnte blank checks to contractors.
Under O'Leary's mitiative, the Department of Energy
(DOE) wiU replace many of its traditional cost-reimbursement contracts with fixed-price contracts, wnte
performance standards into contracts and work to expand the number of companies that bid on projects.
The department long has been accused of wasting millions of taxpayer dollars because it could not effectively
manage contracts that range from cutting-edge nuclear
weapons research to cafeteria services.
Tou know the headlines, from a famous congressman
who says DOE provides open checkbooks to cleanup
firms, to the standard line about contractor rip-off,"
O'Leary said.
'The rap on the department has been that vis-a-vis our
relationship with our contractors, the DOE simply has a
blank check, and last year it was in excess of $18 billion,"
said O'Leary, who tumed to a poster-size check on an easel and wrote "VOID" across it.
The Energy Department is the largest civilian contracting agency in the government, operating with
149,000 contract employees and 20,000 federal employees.
With the end of the Cold War, the department must
shift from nudear weapons research and bomb-building
to cleaning up and disposing of the radioactive waste
around its fonner bomb factories. Cleanup costs are projected at $300 billion over the next 30 years.
Most of the contract spending is in three areas: management and operations, environmental restoration and
waste management, and support services.
Last year, the department spent $15.9 billion of its
$18.2 billion in procurement obligations on management
and operations contracts.
William H. White, deputy energy secretary, said yesterday that too many of the contracts provided for reimbursing contractors for the costs they incurred and included 'Vague scopes of work."
One of the department's first contracts, he said, sunply told the contractor "to build a secret weapon."
Two central features of the plan put together by
O'Leary and White would:
• Increase the use of fixed-price and shared-cost contracts.
The department will devise standards to measure performance and will spell out strategic goals. Contracts
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary wants performance
standards In contracts and bids from more contractors.
would limit the number of "change orders" that often
dnve up costs.
• Restructure "make-or-buy" procedures. Traditionally,
management contractors have made most decisions on
whether to produce matenals or services on-site or go
off-site.
In the future, management contractors will not necessanly provide most services, especially when tasks can
be subcontracted at a lower cost.
O'Leary began her effort to get control of contracting
in May.
Department officials yesterday projected first-phase
savings of $2.3 billion over five years that have come
from freezing contractor salanes for one year, cutting
back on support services and reducing contract employees.

Hanoi Praises End of Embargo
As Key Step in Better Relations
By William Branigin
HANOI. Feb. 4 (Friday)—Vietnamese officials
today welcomed the lifting of a 19-year U.S.
trade embargo against this country, calling it a
logical development whose time had come.
"It's an important event for Vietnam." said Do
Cong Minh, the director of the government's
Foreign Press Center. "Certainly it creates more
favorable conditions for relations between the
two countries."
"This is something we've been waiting for,"
said Vu Binh, a govemment official. "It comes as
the result of a logical development. The Vietnamese public has been prepared for this. On the
American side, the president has the momentum
and political support that he lacked before... .
"This is very meaningful, both strategically
and historically," Binh added.
"Lifting the embargo is really a good gift for
the Vietnamese govemment before our lunar
new year," said a businesswoman, referring to
the Tet holiday that starts next week. "It's good
news, but ordinary people are not so excited because they've been expecting this for a long
time. It's not something that will make people
pour out into the streets."
Indeed, under a senes of steps that previously
relaxed the sanctions, many American companies already are active here, and deals were being signed on the assumption that a formal lifting
was inevitable.
In the latest U.S. bid to gain access to this
growing market of 71 million people, American
Express is scheduled to sign an agreement in
Hanoi today that will permit the use of the American Express charge card in Vietnam. The agreement, the first between an American company
and Vietnam after the lifting of the embargo, is
expected to facilitate American tourism here.
Many establishments already accept Visa cards,
but only if they are issued by non-American
banks.
"It's a great opportunity for Amencan companies," said Eugene Matthews, an Amencan
private consultant here. "Companies are now
going to focus on Vietnam. There will be a cost
in doing so, but particularly in consumer products and pharmaceuticals you will see the marketing muscle of American companies come into
play here. It also gives an opportunity for direct
U.S. capital to come into Vietnam and make investments."
Official U.S. conucts with Vietnam appear to
be accelerating as well. A team of Treasury and
State Department officials plans to come here in
mid-February to open talks on financial claims
stemming from the war. Ho The Lan, a spokesman for Vietnam's Foreign Ministry, told a news
conference Thursday. U.S. government and pn-
vate claims to assets that were -'••.izi by Vie

"This is a necessary and concrete step . .

she made it clear that Vietnam does not expec

For the United Sutes, lifting the embargo is

For Hanoi, a major consideration in ending th<

W a Does the NEA Mean by 'Decency ?
ht
Justice Department Challenges Agency's Standard for Arts Funding
By Martm Booe
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 3—-Decency and respect": Do those two
small words simply invest a bureaucrat with a reasonable amount of discretxmary power, or do they open a
Pandora's box of govenunent control
over freedom of expression?
That was the issue in the final
f
i of Finley et aL V National
L
Endowment far the Arts, as judges
i oral arguments today concerning the constitutiooality ct the "decency andrespect"standard for federal
arts funding. The case began in 1990
when four performance artists chalenged the agency's grant alkxatioo
process, but later broadened to become a flash poirt fcc-^
ree expressxn.
Tbe current phase ts a Justice Deartment appeal of a 1992 federal
ourt decision,- in that ruling, the
Jdge struck down a 1990 statute
equinng that NEA giants comply

nd respect for all the diverse bebefs

Tie judge found the language excesvdy vague.
Karen Finley, H U Hughes, Tan
oy
Miller and John Fleck—performance
artists whose sexually explicit material had caused controversy—sued the
NEA in 1990, claiming they had been
illegally denied grants for political reasons. Later, as several artists organizations and the American Civil liberties Union signed on as additional
piamhfiEs, tbe suit was broadened to
indude a constimtxxial challenge to
the decency dause.
Although the artists and the NEA
settled out of court last June for
$252,000, the Justice Department
filed an appeal to have the decency
languagereinstatedto the grant authonzation process. The dause had
been instituted by Congress m 1990.
In today's hour-long, sparsely attended appeals session, held at the 9th
Csru£ Court of Appeals in Pasadena,
attorneys for the Justice Department
argued that in the context of the
dause, the apphcaoon of "decency and
respect" is tangential to the grant
autbonahop process, and therefore
represents no effort to control speech.
"The fact that the statute is vague
is irrelevant," argued Justice Department attorney Alfred R. Mothn. "It is
not sdf-executmg. . . . Concerns of
decency wffl be taken care of as long
as there is diversity on the panel"
"If the evil is in inappropriate government intervention," countered
Judge Warren Ferguson, one of three
judges hearing the appeal, "then it
seems to me we're sunply giving that
power to a larger group of people."
Although the appeal originally was
Sed under the Bush administration,
the Justice Department under the
Clmtoc administration moved to continue the appeal This startled numerous arts activists who perceived it as
contradictory to the president's campaign pledges. "I can't for the life of
me understand why the Clinton administration is pursuing this appeal,"
said John Frohnmayer, fonner NEA
chief, today.
David Cole, volunteer attorney for
the Center for Constitubonal Rights,
which originally challenged the decency statute, argued that the vague
wording opened the door to excessive
govenunent control of speech.
This is not an abstract case," Cole
said. "When artists apply for funding,
knowing they are subjected to these
vague standards, they are chilled in
their freedom of expression. The ultimate effect is for artists to back away
from anything controversial"
"To allow governmenttouse words

but the next one might."
A decision on the appeal is not
expected for several months.

�For Reagan, Ronald Reagan's
Birthday Party
Many Happy
Returns
REAGAN, FromCl
At GOP Fund-Raiser, Ex-President
Says Clmton Stole His Ideas
By Roxanne Roberts
Withmpon Post StaH Writer
T
he Great Communicator took the podium
last night, accusing the new guy on center
stage of stealing his best lines.
Speaking at a Republican National Committee fund-raiser here, Ronald Reagan
said President Clinton had appropriated the
GOP's traditional themes of crime and welfare reform.
"After watching the State of the Union Address the
other night, I'm reminded of the old adage that imitation is the sincerest form offlattery,"Reagan told the
crowd. "Only in this case, it's not flattery, but grand
larceny—the inteUectual theft of ideas you and I recognize - jur own."
The Republicans called the dinner a birthday party
for Ronald Reagan, which sounds a lot more festive
than a fund-raiser, but raise funds it did. Some 2,500
donors ponied up at least $1,000 each and packed into
the National Building Museum to hear Ron and Nancy
and Margaret Thatcher say wonderful things about
each other and terrible things about those other guys.
It's been five years since the Gipper rode off into
the sunset. The world has changed, but the show is the
same. So is the star: charming, funny and not a gray
hair in sight. Even the setting doesn't look that different.
"As our plane headed toward the airport, I looked
down on the White House and it was just like the good

FINAL
old days," said Reagan. "The Rose Garden, the South
Lawn . . . David Gergen."
Reagan has been playing this part so long that he can
deliver his linesflawlessly,and silently compose a grocery list at the same tune.
Even when his speech seemed halting at tunes, you
got the sense he did it deliberately, just to improve the
timing of his punch lines. "Now, as most of you know, I'm
not one for looking back," he told the audience, which included viewers of CNN, C-SPAN and GOP-TV, the new
cable channel. "I figure there will be plenty of time for
that when I get old."
With Reagan at the podium, the crowd, as usual, went
wild. "I think he gives us the faith to reassert the nghtness of our direction—no pun intended," said Rich Bond,
former Republican Nationa] Committee chairman.
Whatever else you might say about the Teflon president (in his report, Iran-contra independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said that Reagan "set the stage for illegal
activities of others"), he's still the best—some say the
only one—the GOP has when it comes to standing m
front of an audience.
"The Republicans currently don't have anyone who
has that charisma and charm," said Byron Flanders of
Lawrence ville, Ga.
"He epitomized what the Republican Party started to
become in the '80s," said Maine Gov. John McKernan.
chairman of the Republican Governors' Association, "and
is going to be in the '90s."
But the script last night didn't mclude much about thc
future. This was Reagan's night, and Abraham Lincoln.
Winston Churchill, D-day and, yes, even the "Evil Empire" popped up during the speeches. Lady Thatcher costarred in her third Reagan birthday since they won the
Cold War and lost their jobs.
Under your guidance, right made might—and it triumphed!" she thundered, as only she can. Thatcher kepi
heaping praise on her buddy "Ron," but there was just
something about the way she said it that sounded like a
big sister telling him to go clean his room.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole and GOP Chairrmn
Haley Barbour promised a Republican sweep in the fall
and got in a few more tired licks at the current occupant ;
of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. "Bill Clinton's done more to j
help the Republican Party in the last year than I'll do my j
whole term," said Barbour.
Last night's guest list was a roundup of Republican
regulars, including Georgette Mosbacher, James Baker.
Jack Kemp, Howard Baker, Pat Robertson, that fun couple Eva Gabor and Merv Griffin, and daughter Maureen
Reagan. Donors rubbed shoulders with the VIPs, ate an
elaborate four-course meal and raised $5 million for the

which was, to nc one's surprise, rot included in the party
favors.
Ah, yes. It was a birthday party, after all, complete
with balloons and confetti. Both Reagan and his wife
stood behind the chocolate marquis cake with chocolate
elephants as retiring House Minority Leader Bob Michel
crooned the birthday song. Then Reagan—with a bttle
assistance from his First Lady—blew out the eight candles.
"Let the record show he blew them all out on the fust

Cutting MFN hurts China's prospects of

refuses point-blank to meet the president's

do see those steps being taken, we should
find a new approach on human rights.
This year's successes on trade and proliferation offer a model. We have many
trade problems with China—a $23 billion

We are handling them well, using pressure

We should adopt a similar policy oa

MFN has not been fruitless. China has
opened talks with the Red Cross on prison
inspection and has released a few dissidents. It will likely release more before
the spring. But that is not really what we
mean when we talk about mtemational
standards of human rights. What wehope
for is basic change: toleration of dissent,
an end to torture and arbitrary imprisonment as well as the freedom to worship;
organize unions and speak one's mind.
p^r
The hard truth is that MFN conditions
cannot achieve this. Like other methods,
they can bnng only gradual change. And
unlike other methods, their danger will
always vastly exceed their results.
We must not downgrade human nghts. A
policy that did that would be wrong, and—
like the Bush administration's policywould lose the support of Congress. Rather,
we must make human rights a pnonty

Lf we are imaginative, we can do it.
China's pnson labor exports are a good
example. They violate our trade laws—

the U.N. Human Rights Commission in

should know that arrests of dissidents,
labor organizers and religious leaders

loud public censure.
'
And while we must be firm, we yieed
not assume confrontation is always the
best option. China's justice minister told
me last summer he wanted help modernizing China's legal system. We should
give him as much as he'll take. We should
send American experts to China'for legal
exchanges and involve impartiil'international experts like the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and the U.N. Wori^>
ing Group on Arbitrary Deteations.
Finally, we can do more for democracy. We should speak out at a crucial
tune in Hong Kong, as Gov. Chris Patten's reforms go to the legislative council
and the city's democrats risk careers,
homes, even lives. We should end our
policy of avoiding offiaial contact with the
leaders of Taiwan,,who have brought
about a stunning pc^itical transformationin the past five years.
We must be firm in our values and our
goals. But we also must be realistic ip
our methods. The president's executive,
order on China's MFN status was the
right thing foil last spring. It asked China
for modest,, achievable steps, and the

Good News for Rogue States
The Clinton adnunistr.ition claims it is dedicated to (iy;htmR nui'lear proliferation. Indeed,
on Pec. 7 (IVarl H,irlH)r Day, as it happens),
Secretnry of Defense Les Aspin called nuclear
weapons the dangfi "that most urgently and
directly threatens America at home and American interests ahroad." Aspin argued that the
United States needed a counter-proliferation
initiative.
As things stand, however, the administration
is presiding over .i massive decontrol (for
export pui|>oses) of sensitive dual-use technologies—including computers, machine tools and
telecommunirations equipment. These are Ihe
very technologies th.it ro^m: states require for

One ardent barker ol (levonlrolling exports
long deemed sensitive is Clinton's new appointee for secrelary of defense. William Perry.
Indeed, duriiiR Perry's eonfinnntion hearings
for the post of depuiy secretary of defense, he
suggested that "we have to a draw a clean
distinction between defense-unique systems
and . . . dual-use technology. The former, we
can and should control the sale [of] whenever
we thmk that's going lo damage our proliferation goals. But in (the case of) . . . dual-use
technology, 1 Ihink that's a hopeless task.. . . l l
only interferes with a company's ability to
succeed internationally if we try to impose all
sorts of controls in that area."
Ken Timmerman, a fonner House Foreign
Affairs Committee staffer, offers a valid analysis of the implications of this approach: "Perry's
position and the position of this administration
are an open invitation to proliferators everywhere."
In the past, proliferation foes have always
been able to count on the Defense Department
The administration is all
but issuing invitations to

to maintain a hard-line position on export controls—to fight off attempts by the business
community and, often, the Commerce Department to loosen sensitive export restrictions.
Now—with Perry's confirmatio.-: probable—
those concerned by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction lack a high-level advocate within the administration to argue the
issues from a national security and nonproliferation standpoint.
The first wave of the effort to decontrol is in
computers. To counter rapid nuclear proliferation, it's important to control Ihe sale of highspeed computers. Countries developing nuclear
weapons programs seek high-speed computers
to accelerate the design and production of their
programs. Moreover, advanced computers allow
slates to break codes as well as to develop them.
Nevertheless, with Perry's approval, the
United States recently proposed decontrolling
sophisticated compbters up to 260 MTOPS—
millions of theorfetkal operations per seconds.
(A very high-speed desktop computer is 12.5
MTOPS.) Moreover, Washington liberalized
controls on supercomputers—very high-speed
computers—by reclassifying them from 195
MTOPS to 2,000 MTOPS. (The United States
was only able to get Japan's agreement to go to
1.500 MTOPS.)
There's more to come in this realm. As of
April 1, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom)—which was
invented to prevent the Soviet Union and other
Communist countries from obtaining key strategic goods—will cease to exist. With no clear
decision made as to a successor regime, one
thing is clear: CoCom will be replaced by an
entity that will no longer require members to
"pre-notify" the United States regarding the
shipment of sensitive exports. Absent this safeguard, it will be impossible to stop European
countries from selling dual-use technology to
any one of the 23 nations now pursuing programs of weapons of mass destruction.
The new U.S. policy on export controls is
good news for Syria, Iran and North Korearogue states lhat have close working relations
with one another. These outlaw states may
now turn to sharing missile and nuclear technology. Syna, for example, has been removed
from America's "nuclear watch list," a step that
will give Damascus access via third parties to
high-tech computers and other key machine
tools. Such dual-use ilems are central to manufacturing lechnology for nuclear weapons.
This week, Congress has been holding hear-
ings on Perry's nomination (recommending him
for confirmation yesterday) and on a revised
version of the Export Administration Act. Congress plans to rewrite the statute that now
gives the secretary of defense the power to
review sensitive dual-use exports headed for
the former Soviet Union, China, Poland and
Czechoslavakia. Ironically, the battle to keep
tough export controls is being led by the State
Department, not by Defense. In revising this
act, national security concerns should be addressed.
Perry has thus far presided over what one
official described as a "virtual free fall" of
export controls over sensitive technologies. He
has made decisions that may affect America
adversely in the future. In the next three to five
years, while the United States is sizing down its
armed forces, some defense experts worry that
there may not be an adequate defense budget
to counter technological gains made by other
countries—gains facilitated by the new secretary of defense.
Selling American high technology to U.S.
adversaries wil) require developing new and
more expensive systems. Can America gamble
that its ability to develop countermeasures will
forever outpace any offensive threat?
"Decontrol is going to make future wars more
costly and difficult to fight," warns one wellinformed U.S. official. In this context, Secretarydesignate Perry would do well to heed the 1976
words of President Gerald Ford: "All nations
[need to) recognize that the U.S. believes that
nonproliferation objectives must take precedence
over economic and energy benefits if a choice
must be made. . . . The goal is to prevent
proliferation, not simply to deplore it."

Inman and Gates: What Cause for Complaint?
On tfie ashes of Bobby Ray Inman's selfimmolabon, his friend Robert M. Gates seems
intent now on erecting a myth. It is the myth of
some generalized assault on the personal bves
of candidates for high pubbc office.
On this page on Feb. 1, Mr. Gates urged
"the Senate and the media to reflect further
on thetr parts" in inflicting undeserved pain
on nominees awaiting confirmation by attacks
on their "character or reputation."
After a full five minutes of further reflection, I have concluded that while scrutiny of
candidates has sometimes gone beyond proper bounds—we all have our favonte examples, ranging from Justice Clarence Thomas
to Morton Halpenn—among those with the
least cause to complain are Mr. Gates and
Adm. Inman.
Gates, nominated by president Reagan in
1987 to be director of the Central Intelbgence
Agency, withdrew his nomination after two
days of hearings that had nothing to do with his
personal life and everything to do with his
official life. Specifically, he faced opposition in
the Senate Intelbgence Committee over his
ambiguous role in the Iran-contra scandal while
serving as deputy director of the CIA.
Gates said then that he would never make
it to the directorship, but he nevertheless did.
Renominated by President Bush in 1991, he
faced questioning again on his Iran-contra
role and also on his alleged tailoring of
intelligence estimates to the tastes of his
White House superiors and his effect on the
morale of the agency.
In this examination of his official actions,
there was not a whiff of Borking or Guimenng.
He pamed the cntiasm and won confirmation.
Inman has had a much easier time with
Senate confirmations than Gates. He sailed
without a scratch through four confirmations
to positions in the Navy, C A and National
L
Secunty Agency. Selected by President Cbnton on Dec. 16 to be secretary of defense, he
said he hoped for unanimous endorsement by
Taking Exception
the Senate Armed Services Committee. There
was every indication it would be that, or close.
Gates suggest^ relaxing the "long required
pubbc silence of nominees" between nomination and Senate confirmation to permit them
to defend themselves. Gates may not be
aware that Inman, having said as he stood
next to the president that he would "limit my
public remarks on issues until the confirmation process is over." proceeded directly from
the White House to a prearranged television
mterview with Bob Zelnick of ABC. So much
for public silence!
In subsequent days, amid generally favorable
reaction, Inman did get some unfavorable media attention, but it was not of a sort that would
qualify as scurrilous personal attack. His business failures got an airing, but then it was he
who, while accepting nomination, had invited
attention to his ieo,^ as a businessman rather
than his inteUigence background.
In his Jan. 19 sutement of withdrawal,
Stephen S. Rosenfeld
On Bosnia
Out in the country, where he goes to speak
monthly, Secretary of State Warren Christopher
finds that no one asks about Bosnia anymore.
Nor is it or any other regional dispute among his
own "strategic priorities"—economic secunty,
Russia, Europe and NATO, Asa, tbe Middle
East and nonproliferation. Yet he is conducting in
Bosnia a salient test of the new diplomacy of high
gesture and low commitment that global change
and shrinking resources now force upon the
American approach to much world disorder.
For some time the drift of Amencan thinking
has been to regard the much-reduced Muslimled govemment of Bosnia as the war's chief
victim and to resist by diplomatic means the
forced imposition of a settlement on i* Wi^
intemational negotiators now nearing such a
settlement, the Umted States has distanced
itself, creating a bttle pocket of pobtical space
in which the newly militarily revived Muslims
canfighton. This has produced a sharp dispute
with the Europeans. They wish to stop the
fighting with minimal further costs (refugees,
casualties, budget, commerce, nerves, escalation) to themselves.
Is it not strange to form a separate American
pobcy toward what the United States has
termed a "European problem"? Bosnia is not
"European" in a humanitarian sense, notes
Chnstopher in an interview, citing the huge
Amencan aid contribution. Nor is Europe akxie
concerned with containing the conflict. Nor do
Europeans claim the problem is stnctly theirs:
They are desperate for an American role, and
they are getting one, though it is not to put the
screws on the Musbms.
Inman referred to his housekeeper tax problem, but neither the White House nor the
Senate committee had been disposed to make
an issue of that. Inman also cited "vnnolic
atucks" by columnists, notably William Safire. These mclude such matters as Inman's
endorsement of an international arms dealer
in trouble with the law and the admiral's
restnctive policy in the CLA on sharing intelligence with Israel.
His detractors did not peer into hi; private
life or youthful wntrngs. It was he wno raised
the question of his refusal as director ot the
NSA to discharge a gay employee.
Does the experience of either one represent the brutal mauling on which Gates bases
his advice to prospective nominees to "prepare yourself and your family for the worst
. . . activities of your children and other
relatives bared . . . personal and mantal
problems aired?"
Gates and Inman, once CIA colleagues,
have been through a lot together Inman
fought hard to save Gates's nominauon as
director in 1987, and in 1991 he wrote a New
York Times op-ed article defending Gates
against "discredited allegations ui having
slanted intelligence."
Well, one good op-ed tum deserves another, but generalizing Inman's bizarre withdrawal into a reign of anti-nominee terror is
itself bizarre. What sense of immunity do
spymasters enjoy in their secret world that
makes them so touchy about pubbc scrutiny'

Getting Away With Murder
When smart lawyers can convince juries that everyone is a victim, no one is guilty.
When Tonya Harding publicly confessed to
hiding knowledge of the attack on Nancy Kerngan, she said, "Many of you will be unable to
forgive me for that. It will be difficult to forgive
myself." And "I know I have let you down, but 1
have also let myself down."
As a longtime student of the Amencan way of
confession, 1 find this one fascinating. The
themes are self-betrayal and self-forgiveness.
They reflect perfectly a culture in which one no
longer sins against God, natural law, the moral
order, society or even one's fellow man—to
take them in descending metaphysical orderbut against oneself.
In a Zettgnst that worships self above all, you
may have let other people down but the ultimate
sin is to have let yourself down. It follows that the
ultimate virtue is to make peace not with your
victims but with yourself. Thus Jane Aipert, a
'60s radical jailed for several bombings, reflects
on her years in prison: "Ultimately, I spent many
years in therapy, learning to understand, to
tolerate and forgive both others and myself."
This from a woman who participated in bombings that injured 21 people. And why not' In a
culture of grotesque self-absorption, the criminal's psychic restoration is at least as important
as the victim's, and—in a culture of obsessive
spectatorship—far more interesting.
When Lorena Bobbitt was acquitted for the
admined sexual mutilation of her husband, her
lawyer came before the microphones and called
the verdict "a giant step forward for Lorena in the
healing process. She really needs healing." She?
Four days later, Michael Jackson's lawyer
announced a multimillion-dollar settlement for
alleged child molestation with: "Michael wants
to get on with his life and let the healing process
begin." Michael's healing. And the kid's?
When everyone is a victim—in need of "healing"—no one is a victim. We have come to the
reductw ad absurdum of the "root cause" explanation for crime. Once, the root causes were
said to be poverty, joblessness, poor housing,
discrimination—the usual excuses you hear
thrown around after an inner-city riot.
But how are the middle classes to get away
wth murder? Easy. The "root causes" turn out
now to go far deeper than the social and the
economic. They are psychological. And since
there is not a living soul who has not suffered
some psychological trauma—and criminals are
certainly less likely to have sailed through life
un trauma tired—it becomes harder and harder
to hold anyone responsible for anything.
This is not to say that there is never a
psychological derangement that merits acquittal,
even empathy. I thought appropnate the acquittal
of John Hinckley. He was clearly deranged and
delusional, so crazy that he could reasonably be
thought not responsible for his actions.
But the Menendez brothers? These young
men, who shot their rich parents and then
belatedly but tearfully claimed to have done so
because of child abuse, have won two hung
juries. If they get away with murder, it is time
for us to retum to the caves.
Their tnal has elevated therapeutic expiation
to truly comic proportions. The classic definition
of chutzpah is a person who murders his parents
and then demands mercy from the court on the
grounds that he is an orphan. This is meant to
be a joke.
Yet the followmg occurred at the Menendez
tnal: The prosecutor, cross-examining a psychologist brought by the defense, pointed out
that Lyle Menendez bought $15,000 worth of
Rolex watches and money clips after murdering
his parents and then wore one of the Rolexes to
his parents' funeral. "Was that an act of respect?" the prosecutor asked.
"He had this strong love for his father,"
replied the psychologist. "And the conditions
that had been produced meant he had lost his
father. He no longer had this person he loved."
We are meant to feel sorry for L.ie because,
after all, he had just lost his fai.ier How did he
lose him? Owing to "the conditjom t.-jt had been
produced"—a spectacular eupher-jsm for patricide. So we are to explain this apparent act ol
disrespect (flaunting inhented wealth at father's
funeral) as the response of a despondent child
who had just been orphaned—from parents he
had just murdered!
As Yogi Berra said upon leamng that the
mayor of Dublin was Jewish. "On;y -n America."
But this joke is dangerous. O-r -D^fssion with
the psychic welfare of the vKtj-^-r leaves us
philosophically defenseless aga^i . ".me. When
the victimizer is nothing more -.in another
victim, justice becomes impossible Lorena Bobbitt walks. The Menendez broilers prove impossible to convict. Tonya Harding. 1 wager, is
already preparing a double whammy defense:
child and spouse abuse.
The president and Congress can climb al
over each other to be tough on cnme. But sc
long as the only real crimes are crimes againsi

Fork Over Policy in the House

NA TRIUMPH of pork over policy, a House
subcommittee has voted down as excessive a

federal aid to elementary and secondary educa-

Saudi Arms Dealer Teams Up
With an Israeli Partner,
Pushing Industrial Plans
Covering Gaza's Waterfront
By PETEB WALDMAN
Sta/f Reporter of T H E W J U X S T K E C T JOITRNAI.
SAVYON, Israel - Whenever Yaacov
Nimrodl starts talking aboot his life's
adventures, his boyish face lights up.
Soon, the 67-year-oW IsraeU spy-turnedbusinessman Is bounding across his study
to the mahogany bookshelves, pulling
down old photo albums.
"Here's Adnan and me in Italy during
my daughter's honeymoon," he says, displaying a snapshot of tbe Nlmrodi daa
dining last fall with Adnan Khashoggi, the
Saudi Arabian financier. Mr. Nimrodl
smiles. "Adnan is a great man," he says.
"He loves peace. He loves Israel."
Adnan Khashoggi and Yaacov Nlmrodi,
the arms-dealing duo who helped bring the
world the Iran-Contra fiasco, are back,
pooling their chutzpah again for a new era
in the Mideast. This time, the gunrunners,
who have traveled the world targeting a
buck, have sworn off the business of death.
Instead, they are plowing their money into
peace.
Playing the Angles
Messrs. Khashoggi and Nimrodi are
angling to become the leading industrialists in the Gaza Strip after Israel's anticipated withdrawal later this year. Their
plans cover the waterfront. In the works
are a telecommunications system, electricpower generator, desalinization plant,
pipe factory, a Muslim-pilgrimage company, investment bank, railroad, even an
airline. In all, Mr. Nimrodi says the investments could reach $ 0 million. . 50
The comrades-in-arms aren't equal
partners in every planned venture. S m
o e
of the projects are taking shape aboard the
peripatetic Mr. Khashoggi's DC-9 jet,
while others are evolving here in Mr.
Nimrodi's Gatsby-esque mansion near Tel
Aviv. But the two adventurers are working
with each other, and with the World Bank,
to form several large industrial companies
that would be owned by Israeli. Palestinian
and other Arab investors.
"This isn't charity. We're fully profit,
oriented." the 5&-year-old Mr. Khashoggi
says in his Paris townhouse. With his U.S.
bankruptcy problems behind him. Mr.
Khashoggi says he is focusing on Russia,
Iran and the Mideast. In the past two
years, he says he has made nearly $
3
million on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
"If we can help the Palestinians today," he says, "we'll profit later on."
In From tlw Coiil
Mr. Khashoggi says he ffes been secretly sowing seeds in Israel for years. As
far back as 1967, the confidant of Saudi
kings opened clandestine links with Westem Jews, Mossad agents and Israeli politicians, In an effort to bridge the Arab-Israeli divide. The contacts were a risky
breach of the Arab boycott of Israel. But
now that peace seems at hand, Mr. Khashoggi is emerging from the shadows.
"My role has always been a soft one,"
he says. "I was just opening doors."
The Khashoggi vision is simple: Forge
peace through commerce.

"
Some U.S. companies, which have been

will permit the use of Its credit cards there,
according to Eugene Mathews, a U.S.
consultant to the company who has lived in
Viemam since 1990.
"
• Although Asian and European business
competitors have ignored the U.S. embargo for years, Mr. Mathews believes that
some U.S. companies, particularly in the

Mr. CUnton said. "I never bad a briefing on

Nationwide Gains FCC Acts to Keep Pace With Changes
In House, Senate. Reshaping the Communications Sector
By KENNETH H. BACON
Slaf} RepoTter 0/ T H E W A L L S T R E E T J O U R N A L
WASHINGTON - Actions in the House
and the Senate appeared to remove a
traditional obstacle to passage of a nationwide banking bill, the top legislative goal
of many of the nation's largest banks.
A House Banking Committee panel
voted unanimously to allow banks to establish nationwide branch systems. In the
Senate, meanwhile. Sen. Christopher Dodd
(D., Conn.) withdrew an insurance amendment that has blocked passage of nationwide banking in the past.
The actions follow months of lobbying
by leaders of major bank companies,
which argue that the creation of interstate
branch networks could save tbe industry
billions of dollars annually by allowing
them to consolidate operations in different
states into unified networks.
Passage of such a plan would trigger a
wave of acquisitions as companies such as
BankAmerica Corp. and NationsBank
Corp. scramble to establish cross-country
empires, accelerating the current industry
consolidation. Nationwide branch networks would make it easier for consumers
and businesses to use one bank to meet all
their banking needs, no matter where they
are in the country.
For years, efforts to allow the creation
of nationwide banking networks have
failed because insurance agents, a politically powerful group, have tried to use the
bills as vehicles for limits on insurance
sales by banks. The addition of insurance
restrictions to previous bills turned the
banking industry against the legislation
because banks want to preserve their right
to sell a wider range of financial products,
such as insurance and mutual funds.
Although insurance and other issues
could derail the bill as it works its way
through Congress, the chances of passage
this year are stronger than ever. Yesterday's congressional action "is very g:ood
for interstate. It opens up the possibility of passage," said Edward Yingling,
chief lobbyist for the American Bankers
Association.
In the House Banking Committee, the
Subcommittee on Financial Institutions
voted 29-0 for an interstate plan. The bill
avoids any reference to insurance, and
subcommittee Chairman Stephen Neal
(D., N.C.) expressed confidence that the
bill will make it through the full Banking
Committee and the House.
The Senate Banking Committee is
scheduled to take up an interstate bill on
Feb. 23. In the past. Sen. Dodd has offered
an amendment to restrict the current
ability of nationally chartered banks to sell
insurance nationwide through units in
small towns.
But in a statement last night. Sen. Dodd
said he was withdrawing his insurance
amendment because he hadn't been able to
work out a plan that could win Senate
passage. "While I will continue to support
legislation to rationalize bank sales of
insurance, I do not want to hold up interstate branching legislation." he said.
The House bill contains the following
provisions:
-One year after enactment, the Federal Reserve Board would be able to allow
bank-holding concerns or foreign banks
to buy banks anywhere in the nation.
-Eighteen months after enactment, a
bank-holding company with units in more
than one state can consolidate them into
one system.
- Three years after enactment-and
earlier if states agree - the Comptroller of
the Currency, which regulates nationally
chartered banks, may approve these
banks' applications to acquire banks
across state lines.
A number of consumer and other
amendments still could end up slowing or
blocking passage of the legislation.

SEC Queried on Oversight ot Utilities That Diversify
By

JOURNAL
Staff
Reporter
WASHINGTON - The chairmen of two
House subcommittees are questioning the
ability of the Securities and Exchange
Commission to supervise public utility
companies that enter the telecommunications business.
Democratic Reps. Edward Markey of
Massachusetts and Philip Sharp of Indiana said utility companies' proposals to
add telecommunications to their business portfolios "raise a profound publicpolicy issue concerning whether multistate electric utilities would be effectively regulated if they were allowed to
diversify into fields not related to their
core energy businesses."
The SEC oversees public utility holding companies and must approve the
companies' diversification into other businesses. The SEC's oversight dates back to
legislation that followed the 1 2 stock99
market crash.
Earlier this week. Rep. Rick Boucher
(D., Va.) suggested that he would offer
legislation giving utility companies a
blanket exemption from S C regulations
E
that could prohibit their joining the telecommunications business.
Mr. Boucher's declaration prompted
Mr. Markey, chairman of the House
Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, and Mr. Sharp, chainnan of
the House Energy and Power Subcommittee, to direct a series of questions to
S C Chairman Arthur Levin regarding

�every case has raised another practical

them who don't have conflicts of interest.
. That was the issue highlighted in the case
of the late Freya Neaman, whose family
sued Kaiser for allegedly failing to
promptly diagnose her lung cancer.
Ms. Neaman's family lost the arbitration. But last year they got the California
Supreme Court to throw out the ruling
because the neutral arbitrator, a retired
. judge, hadn't disclosed that he had served
as Kaiser's own arbitrator in five previous
cases. (The ban on appealing arbitrations
generally can be lifted if there is evidence
of bias or fraud.) Thejudge's "relationship
with Kaiser was a substantial business
relationship and should have been fully
disclosed," the court said.

like almost every other issue in the healthcare debate, arbitration involves some
difficult tradeoffs. Kaiser has asked patients to forfeit some of their rights. But
in so doing, it has managed both to cut its
legal costs and to compensate a significant
percentage of injured people.

�Southeast Scores via Manufacturing: Mix
Unique Blend Yields Growth on U.S. Housing Boom
By HELENE C O E
O PR
Sla//
Reporter of T H E W A L L S T R E E T J O U R N A L
ATLANTA - Ust Friday, the Commerce Department pronounced the nation's economy stronger than at any point
since late 1987. No one had to tell the
Southeast.
"Things are so good right now that I
don't even want to talk about it," says Jim
Diffee, president of Brookwood Furniture
Co. in Pontotoc, Miss. For the past 1
8
months, he says, Brookwood, which makes
sofas, love seats and chairs for home-furniture companies, has been going like gangbusters. Sales in 1993 were up 30% from
1992, and net income tripled.
The news is the same through much of
the region. Thanks largely to a unique mix
of manufacturers that are able to take
advantage of the nationwide bousing
boom, the Southeast's economy has been
moving smartly ahead.
That mix - of household textiles, appliances, furniture and construction products-helped keep manufacturing-employment rates in the region level through the
first nine months of 1993. By contrast,
manufacturing employment nationwide
fell 16 through the third quarter.
.%
Such industries, of course, can be found
throughout the country. But the concentration of those manufacturers in the Southeast, according to the recent regional
update by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta, means that Brookwood Furniture
and its neighbors should continue to outpace the rest of the country "as national
housing activity bounces back."
Last year, for instance. Brookwood
added 68 employees to its rolls, boosting
the number of workers 1 % to 464. The
7
company would like to add more this year,
says Mr. Diffee, but with unemployment in
the area of only 4%, Brookwood is facing a
rare labor shortage.
The carpet market "is up 5%," reports
John Swift, chief financial officer of Mohawk Industries Inc., an Atlanta manufacturer of commercial and residential carpets. "That's not a bad increase, since
we've been at between 2% and 3% (annual
growth! for a while," he says. Mr. Swift
sees the increase in residential carpet
sales, which account for a bigger portion of
Mohawk's sales increase, as directly tied
to the housing market.
The Southeast's above-average economic performance is becoming something of a habit: the region has consistently attracted new businesses and created jobs at a pace well ahead of the
nation, says Mark Vitner, an economist
with First Union Bank in Charlotte, N.C.
That growing job disparity has brought job
seekers to the area, which, in turn, has
given the housing market a lift. "Six

Southeast states rank among the top 10 in
terms of attracting new residents from
other states," Mr. Vitner said. Correspondingly, building permits for
single-family homes were up nearly 1 %
2
throughout the region in 1993 and should
rise an additional 7% in 1994, he says.
Also setting the Southeastern economy
apart from the nation has been the normality of the region's economic recovery,
economists say. While the nation's gross
domestic product shot up at an annual
rate of 5.9% in the 1993 fourth quarter,
according to figures released last week by
the Commerce Department, the recovery
has been lacking in job growth. But not for
the Southeast. For one thing, corporate
layoffs haven't been as big a factor in the
region as in the rest of the country.
"When you take a look and say. What
are the factors making the economy shrink
nationally?,' you'll see we don't really
have those industries," says Donald Ratajczak. director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in
Atlanta. "It's the military, for mstance.
Well, we've got military in the Southeast,
but we don't make the equipment for them.
So we don't have the big drain a California
or a Connecticut is taking."
Furthermore, a great deal of regional
pride in the South, manifesting itself in the
boosterish, pro-business attitude particularly prevalent in places like Atlanta and
Charlotte, has helped the region recruit
and retain businesses. "You look at areas
in the Northeast with a chronic revenue
shortfall - well they're always looking for
businesses to pick up taxes," Mr. Vitner
said. "That's chasing a lot of businesses
out of their states."
Still, the Southeast has its problems.
While metropolitan areas like Atlanta,
Charlotte, Nashville, Tenn., and Jacksonville. Fla.. are seeing huge population
growth, rural areas aren't shanng in
that growth. These areas, economists say.
whicb have long depended largely on a
single company for employment, are find1
ing that shifts to high-technology machinery are making hometown companies
less labor-intensive.
In addition, the region's heavy reliance
on manufacturing means that job losses in
the apparel industry nationwide are felt
particularly in the South. Even those
losses, however, should be offset by employment gains in factories that make
construction materials and home furnishings, the Federal Reserve says.
The good times won't last forever,
though. "Construction isn't going to do
better than other industry forever." says
Tom Cunningham, an economist with the
Federal Reserve. "Then that single im
petus for rapid growth will fade." What s
more, as the Southeast grows in popula
tion, it will begin to look more like the
rest of the country.
"If you're a small area, it's easy to be
different," Mr. Cunningham says. "Once
you get big, it's harder."
Government Says Transportation Firms
Must Test 25% of Employees for Alcohol
By DANIEL PEARL
Staff Reporter of T H E W A L L S T H E E T J O U R N A L
WASHINGTON - The Transportation
Department said it will require transportation companies to test for alcohol use 25%
of workers whose jobs affect safety, but
will allow the rate to change depending on
how each industry performs.
The new testing rules, crafted to meet a
law passed in 1991, also would double the
number of transportation workers covered
by federal drug-testing rules, to about 7.5
million workers. The alcohol and drug-testing rules will cover airlines, trucking
companies, transit systems, railroads and
gas-pipeline concerns.
The extra, drug and alcohol testing
would cost businesses an estimated S
2
biUion over the next 10 years, and the rules
could face legal chaUenges from unions
and employers. Both groups found fault
with the regulations yesterday.
Unions said the rules don't give
workers enough protection against erroneous test results, and aUow employers to
impose a tougher standard than the govemment does. The rules require an employee whose blood-alcohol level tests
above .04% to be reUeved from safety-related duties. But "an employee could faU
under the threshold and stiU be fired." said
Ed Wytkind. an executive director of.the
AFL-CIO's transportation trades department.
Industry representatives said the rules
would be costly for businesses to put into
effect, particularly because the Transportation Department would also require employees to be tested for alcohol when they
apply for a job. "Pre-employment testing
is an IQ test, not a safety test." said John J.
CoUins. a lobbyist for the American Trucking Associations. He also questioned the
value of alcohol tests that truckers would
receive only when they returned to the
terminals, and tests that independent
truckers would perform themselves.
Transportation Department officials
said the safety benefits far exceed the
costs. They said the govemment couldn't
prevent employers from taking their own
actions against employees, and that people
have shown up for airline interviews with
drugs in their system. Federico Pena,
Transportation secretary, said unions and
businesses should spend their money reducing drug and alcohol use instead of
fighting the rules.
Mr. Pena noted that smaU businesses
would have until January 19%, instead of
next January, to begin alcohol-testing andk
said the rules have "clear common-sen^,
incentives" for businesses to decr^

That's unfair, the CUnton administration insists. It wants the leading industrial nations to adopt strict antibribery

that tough new rules will raise corporate

"The U.S. has taken a step no one else
has, and It puts our business people,

chief U.S. trade negotiator. "Companies
which don't pay bribes because of legal
constraints or corporate practice are unfairly disadvantaged." says Daniel
Tarullo, assistant secretary of state for
economic and business affain, and point

U.S. businessmen welcome the effort,

Bond prices sank on speculation that
the Federal Reserve has decided to boost
short-term interest rates. Stock prices followed bonds lower, and the dollar rose.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell
7.88 points to 3967.66. Standard & Poor's
500-stock index lost 1.29 to 480.71 and the
Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 1.78 to

Traders speculated about arisein rates
after the Fed failed to intervene in the
market when the federal funds rate was
trading above the targeted 3% level.
" I would take that as a sign the Fed has
begun to tighten," said Donald Maude,
chief U.S. fixed-income strategist at Scotia
McLeod (USA). "It's very, very subtle - at
best an implicit indication they may be

some inflationary pressures in the latest
purchasing managers' reports may have
forced the Fed's hand.
Alan Sinai, chief economist at Lehman
Brothers, said he expects the Fed to shift
its stance from neutral to a bias toward
tightening during the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends
today. But he thinks there's only a 2 %

Two former Riegle aides are now pushing "consoUdation" from key positions at
Treasury and the comptroller's office. The
Treasury aide, Richard Carnell, actually
wrote much of the burdensome financial
regulation of recent years. So now he is
flacking a proposal that would in effect
give him more power, all in the name of
easing the overregulation he helped create! He's not short of brass either.
Having a single, all-powerful regulator
would also enhance the, well, opportunities for political mediation. Last week
Mr. Carnell exulted in public that "the
proposal will give consumer interests
something they have never had before: a
federal regulator that takes them seriously." Parse that sentence:.. By "consumer interests" he means not Joe; Depositor but interest groups and Nidertype lobbies trying to allocate bank landing via politics.

Unless, that is, Mr. Clinton cai change

by Frank Newman, a senior Treasury
aide, when he, Mr. Carnell and Mr. Ludwig met last month with the feiecutive
committee of the Independent Bankers Association of America, which is fighting the
Clinton plan. Mr. Newman said the administration will get three Fed appointments in the coming years. "The message
was, if we don't get you now, we'D get you

Chairman David Mullins's surprise departure this week, that later could be even
sooner.
Every president needs pals in high

�Healthy Businesses \J
The Business Roundtable's overwhelming vote against supporting the
Clinton health care proposal deserves
some attention, for what it says about
this issue and more generally about
business's dealings with Washington.
Up to now, there's often been a demarcation line between big and small
business on issues like this one. The
National Federation of Independent
Business, the small-business lobby,
has come to be viewed as the main opponent of govermnent expansions,
while the Business Roundtable historically has been suspected of an instinct
to cut a deal, absorb the costs and let
their smaller competition figure out
how to survive the added burdens.
The CUnton Administration seems
to have been surprised to discover
that the Roundtable's normally round
heels are suddenly dug in. We know
the Clintonites dislike the 1980s, but
maybe they should have been paying
closer attention to what was going on
then in corporate America. Better
yet, rather than giving off the impression that they're too smart to talk
to businessmen (we're thinking of the
eyes-only White House health care:
task force), they might have spent
some time with the CEOs now running these companies. The key,
though, would have been to talk to
them about business, not the blue sky
of public policy.
They'd have learned that the oldstyle corporate empire-builders are
largely gone. During the 1980s, corporate America was forced to restructure, downsize and adopt some new
ways of doing busmess. The new
breed of CEOs who've gone through
those wrenching changes are obsessed
with controlling costs.
President Clinton and HiUary Clinton both made personal appeals to the
Roundtable. S did superwonk Ira
o
-.Magaziner. They apparently didn't
• I shift a single vote. One big reason, we
7; sospect, is that the pitch had no cred:; Ibility on the cost side.
'
One of the most important lessons
business leaders have been forced to
leam the past 20 years is: Mandates
conceal costs and so tend to proliferate like mushrooms. State and local
governments have long been burdened by federal mandates that drive
up budgets and restrict flexibility.
They also know that the feds largely
turn a deaf ear to complaints about
enforcement absurdities; and they
rarely suffer politically for the damage mandates cause.
Members of the Roundtable and
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
which also declared its opposition to
the Clinton plan yesterday, say they
are convinced the employer health-insurance mandate in the CUnton plan
would work the same way. Business
would become, in effect, the tax collector for the health care state. When
the system's financing proved inadequate, price controls would be tightened and the plan's insurance "alliances" would start rationing some
types of care.
There's another significant shift
evident in the Roundtable outcome.
On most such issues, it's often the corporations' Washington reps who shape
their public posture. These folks are
Beltway lifers. Many are ex-Congressional staffers, and historically few
executives were wining to ignore the
road maps the reps drew to steer firms
around legislative road hazards and
other arcana.
But we're talking here about
repaving one-seventh of the economy.
Ira Magaziner told the Roundtable's
Washington reps that the center of the
health care debate lies between between the Cooper bill and Canada,
namely Clinton. That's the kind of
"compromise" reps have sold to CEOs
in the past, but it appears this issue's
implications are too vast to absorb"
the costs of another Beltway deal.
We hope that now the Roundtable's
members will put the health care plan
drafted by Democratic Rep. Jim
Cooper under the same glass they
used toflyspeckthe CUnton plan.
Some members privately agree that
Cooper contains provisions that could
expand bureaucracy and mandates,
though it avoids the one-size fits-all
Clinton approach.
It looks, though, as if folks on both
sides of the issue learned a few things
this week. It'd be nice to mink that a
lot of Beltway folks learned what the
business community discovered in the
'80s: You get punished for trying to
hide or ignore your real costs.

of ihe South and former chancellor
of the Universily of Arkansas
Bassett, now Beverly BasseUSchaffer, says all Ihe talk of elitist
mutual back-scratching is overstated. She never met McDougal. she
says, and never knew the Clintons
were partners in Whiiewater.
As for Hillary Clinton's represenlalion of Madison, Dassett-SchafTer
says she was not impressed to see the
governor's wife's name on it "Not
one b i t . . . She was just this olher
person at the law d i m If we didn't
have an answer she liked, Ihal was
just (oo bad."
A l l h o u g h Bassett-Schaffer acknowledges Little Rocks insiders
"weren't as vigilant about appearances at the lime," she says, "I wanl
to allay everybody's concerns. Gov-
emment in Arkansas was not run in
a shady fashion or any sort of cronyism (hat has been transported to
Washington, D C That's not the way
Ihings happened at all. . . . We can't
help il thai you keep running inlo the
same people, b u l . . . Ihere was no effort to protect political friends."
Bul some say the cozy, casual blurring of business and social boundaries created a climate ripe for
abuses that veered into impropriety.
"The government of Arkansas was
loo close to Ihe power elite," says
Rep. Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican whose questions aboui the Clintons' ties to McDougal, Madison and
Whitewater propelled the old relationships into a national issue. "Madison was run as a private piggy bank
for insiders as well as some of the Arkansas political establishment."
In Liltle Rock's new-money universe of (he late 1970s and early '80s.
McDougal was a self-made player in
a baby-blue Benlley. His clout was
realized in the exploding banking
and real estate boom, but it was
borne of politics: He worked for the
presidenlial campaign of John F.
Kennedy and the staffs of Sens. John

Liltle Rock's late-'70s boom "was

says Lindsey. "McDougal was in the

eniire risk, you re going lo . . . pilch

you are friendly with," Lindsey says
McDougal's myriad banking and
real-estate deals grew and attracted
investments from the state's VIPs:
current Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy
Tucker; Seth Ward, Uie father-in-law
of top Justice Department official
Webster Hubbell, a former law partner of Hillary Clinton; Fulbright; Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.
But r e g u l a t o r s ' r e p o r t s show
McDougal was a careless manager,
especially when it came lo Madison.
During his tenure as owner, its
$6 million in deposits and tiny loan
portfolio ballooned to deposits of
$123 million. Loans to officers, directors and related parties swelled from
$500,000 (o $17 million.
That kind of rapid growth is dangerous, indicating an S&L is offering

and making high-interest loans to
risky borrowers.
"If you had lo pick the typical

S&L expert. "It had every symptom:
low capital, rapid growth, non-traditional investments, excessive compeasation for ils officers, etc."
Fly says even its connecUon to polilicians was common: "There was a
mutual attraction between politicians and S&Ls. A lot of S&Ls were
looking (or political cover, politicians
were looking for money Bul outside
of that, many S&L execs were politically active people anyway."
Eventually, McDougal's world unraveled, ending in Madison's failure
and his 1989 indictment for bank
fraud lle was later acquilied. During
that lime, his ties to the Clintons remained intact: Hillary Clinton even
sought, but did not receive, power of

Whitewater
paper traU
a mud one
B>' Dennis Cauchon
USA TODAY
YELLVILLE. Ark. - If the
devil is in the details, the spirit
of Whitewater may reside on
Lot 13 on County Road 666.
Located on a dirt road. Lot
13 is a 2.7-acre wooded plot
where Hillary Rodham Clinton
built a model home to spark
sales of Whitewater lots.
Nothing illegal has been
found in its handling, but the
paperwork is so sloppy that
seemingly simple transactions
are clouded in mystery.
Land and mortgage records
are an inconsistent mish-mash
of dates, dollars and owners.
The imprecise paperwork is
all the more unusual because it
was done by a banker, James
McDougal; a respected lawyer,
Hillary Clinton; and a veteran
real-estate agent, Chris Wade.
"The whole Whitewater
thing smacks of very poor
bookkeeping," says Thomas
Ochsenschlager. a Washington
tax lawyer and accountant
"From what I can tell, no
one was trying to do anything
wrong but it is acutely embarrassing for a partner in the
most prestigious law firm in
Arkansas to be involved in
something with such unusually
sloppy paperwork."
If the Clintons did nothing
wrong the Whitewater story
has lingered in part because of
poor paperwork that might be
interpreted as nefarious.
Lot 13 perfectly illustrates
the Clintons' paper problems.
The story of Lot 13 should be
simple: Hillary Clinton borrowed $30,000, built a modular
home and sold it to a Mississippi man. The man went broke.
The Qintons got the property
back from bankruptcy court
and resold it
But the paperwork at the
courthouse here and elsewhere is full of quirks.
For example, the Qintons
recorded selling the property
for the second time on Nov. 28,
1988 — three days before they
recorded buying it back.
That's no crime, but it is odd.
The most serious problem
for Clinton is that Lot 13 provides a link between the failed
Madison Guaranty Saving and
Loan and the CUntons.
Records show that in November 1985, Whitewater Development Co. Inc. made a
$7,322 payment on a loan taken
out by Bill Clinton on Lot 13.
The problem: Whitewater's
money to pay Qinton's loan
came from Madison Marketing. And Madison Marketing
got all its money from Madison
S&L, whose failure cost taxpayers at least $47 million. Madison Marketing was owned by
Susan McDougal, James
McDougal's wife.
White House aide Bruce
Lindsey says it's irrelevant
whether the money came from
a McDougal personal account
or Madison Marketing.
"There's nothing improper
about it," he says. Other quirks:
• Bank of Kington, owned
by James McDougal, loaned
Hillary Clinton $30,000 on Dec.
16, 1980 - 10 days before she
owned Lot 13, which was used
as collateral.
It is unusual — but not a
crime — for a bank to ican first
and get the collateral later.
• Hillary Clinton got Lot 13
without paying for i t She paid
no income taxes for getting the
property, worth about $3,000.
The White House says the lot
and home were effectively
owned by Whitewater.
Hillary Qinton loaned the
$30,000 back to Whitewater in
"a mirror loan," says Lindsey,
and Whitewater made the loan
payments. But no public documents reflect a mirror loan.
"It's pretty hard to construct
a scenario where Hillary
doesn't have some tax liability
on the property,'' Ochsenschlager says. Most likely she
should have reported the value
of Uie property as a dividend
from Whitewater, he says.
• The Clintons bought Lot 13
again in November 1988, according to county land and
bankruptcy court records.
Their taxes show they owned
the property in March 1987.
• The Clintons' tax returns
show Uie property was sold for
$23,758. County land and assessor records say it was $28,000.
Those discrepancies don't
prove wrongdoing, but they illustrate why questions persist
The White House has answers for most questions.
Foi exiiiii^ic, the C'iintons
rely on Denver attorney James
Lyons' report to show they lost
$68,900 on Whitewater, although they haven't claimed
the full loss on their taxes.
The Lyons report details the
Clintons' Whitewater finances
from 1980 through 1991 — except for 1990, which is omitted
without explanation.
Lindsey says there was no
accountant worksheet for 1990,
so Uie information was merged
with 1991.

The Chicago Tribune reported Thursday that Hillary Rodham Qinton worked for federal regulators in a lawsuit filed
agunst Qinton friend and investment banker Dan Lasater.
Her law firm settled a $3.3
million suit against Lasater &
Co. for $200,000. The case involved First American Saving

S&L that failed in 1986.
Lasater, a Little Rock businessman, was a political supporter of Gov. Bill Qinton. He
also employed Roger Qinton,

Lasater and Roger Clinton

Senate gives boost
to prayer in schools
The Senate voted Thursday to deny federal funds to public schools that bar "constitutionally protected" voluntary'
prayer in schools. But the provision could be largely symbolic, because public school prayer during school hours has
been unconstitutional since a 1962 Supreme Court ruling.
The court last year barred official prayer at graduation ceremonies. The Senate. 77-22. adopted the amendment by
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-S.C. to an education bill. Helms asked
what message is sent "when the govemment forbids the
reading of the Bible and pays for condoms in schools."

�I ra matized by g in ire,
children suggest solutions
By Robert Davis
USA TODAY
Reaching out to kids
Teary-eyed and emotional,
11 children whose lives have
been scarred by gunfire urged
politicians Thursday to help
stop violent crime.
Monique Malloy, 16. of
Washington, D.C, told members of the House Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice to stop "standing outside
the circle. We're standing inside the circle."
Four of Malloy's friends, including a cousin, have been
shot to death in the past two
years. She urged politicians
who want to help to "talk the
talk and walk the walk."
Some of the kids' solutions:
• A national curriculum on
conflict resolution. "There is a
lot of anger inside young people today," said Alicia Brown,
14, of Washington, D.C, who
watched a friend die. "They
don't talk it out Instead, they
take their anger out on other
people."
• Mandatory gun safety education. Deseree Troy, 13, of Indianapolis, said gun buyers
should have to attend safety
classes during the five-day
waiting period now mandated
by federal law. "It's a hassle,
but would you rather be hassled by that or by paying for a
funeral bill because your child
got a hold of your gun?"
• Tougher sentences for
kids who kill. "If a kid is old
enough to shoot somebody, he's
old enough to be put away,"
said Megan McGillicuddy, 15,
of New York City, whose principal was killed two years ago

Deterrence' on Southwest borde
Plan aimed Crackdown along the U.S.-Mexican bordei
at illegal
immigration
Bv Maria Puente
USA TODAV
The Clinton administration,
pressured by Califomia lawmakers desperate to do something about illegal immigration, said Thursday it would
beef up the U.S. Border Patrol
in a two-year, $540.5 million
program to stop theflowacross
the border.
"This administration is committed to safeguarding America's proud history of openness
to newcomers," said Attorney
General Janet Reno. "But we
will not permit this cherished
tradition to be jeopardized by
weakness in enforcing our immigration laws."
Reno and Immigration and
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner refused to characterize the new
effort along the Mexican borc'sr as a "blockade."
"Our strategy at the southwest border is deterrence
through prevention," Reno said
at a news conference, flanked
by a bipartisan group of beaming California legislatore.
By the end of 1995 the administration hopes to have
4,471 agents — up from 3,461
— in EI Paso and San Diego,
where most illegal crossings
occur. The Border Patrol alone
would get $180 million under
the plan, which requires congressional approval.
GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter,
who represents San Diego,
praised the plan, but called for
10.000 agents to be deployed
along the 2.000-mile border.
An expensive blockade experiment in El Paso last fail cut
illegal crossings to a trickle,
though businesses sufered and
Mexican officials grumbled.
Repeating the El Paso experiment would be difficult in
San Diego because of different
terrain and more illegal crossing, Meissner said.
But the political pressure to
take action on illegal immigration has reached explosive proportions, especially in California, where ugly arguments
over immigration costs, and
charges of job-stealing, fraud
and discrimination have divided communities.
Meissner said the strategy is
to increase enforcement to the
point that it discourages people
from even trying illegal crossings, thus reducing apprehensions. Then, officials hope,

Fed ready to pull
plug on low rates
NEW YORK — How long can the Fed wait?
It's beenfiveyears since the Federal Resen-e last pushed
interest rates higher. Remember leSSP Ghostbusiers and
Indiana Jones sequels were playing in Uieaters. Milli Vanilli
was the hot new musical group. The Buffalo Bills hadn't yet
lost a Super Bowl.
And the average yield on six-month bank certificates of
deposit was as high as 9 3^ (in
April) — not today's 2.8 r.
Now. the downward spiral may
be reversing. Thursday, the Fed
declined to fight market forces
that pushed its key rate well
above the 3Cr target for a while.
Some economists expect the
benchmark fed funds rate, available to big banks for overnight
loans, to stabilize at 3.25% in coming weeks. It's been 3% since September 1992. "Allowing this to
happen at a time the Fed knows
it's being watched closely is a concrete signal that the Fed has begun the process" of bumping rates
higher, says David Jones, economist at Aubrey Lanston.
What's that mean? The economic recovery has been given enough juice, and if it gets any more, things might get out
of hand. That is, inflation could become a problem. Think of
it as seventh-inning stretch at the ballgame. That's when
beer vendors at some ballparks go home, just in case the
crowd was getting too much of a good thing.
For savers, the Fed's inaction is a signal that modestly

�Today's debate: HEALTH-CARE REFORM
Any reform must cover all
The president can
O R VIEW compromise in
U
many areas, but universal coverage isn't one of them.
So far. says Rep. Mike Synar of Oklahoma, the battle over health reform is "a
j game of perception." If so. the percepj tion is that President —
,! Clinton is losing.
The ambitious
Ginton plan has suffered a senes of potentially hurtful setbacks. And while
that's not necessarily
bad, it will be if the result is to place the
goal of umversal coverage in jeopardy.
Look what's happened just this week:
• The Business Roundtable, an influential association of 225 CEOs, endorsed a rival plan authored by Rep.
Jim Cooper of Tennessee that promises
only access, not coverage.
• The Chamber of Commerce, representing 215,000 businesses, said Clinton's plan nnt even a "starting point."
• And the National Governors' Association endorsed Clinton's ideas for em-
ployer-based insurance but retreated
from the notion that employers should
pay 80% of the cost.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole has
abandoned his witless claim that there is
no cnsis. His new position: "Everybody
should be covered."
But as Dole moves toward umbrella
coverage, the White House is softening
that demand. Its new euphemism —
"guaranteed pnvate insurance" — is
rhetoncal fudge.
You can argue over what these omens
actually mean, but the perceived message is the troubling one. It is that the
early debate has shifted from ways to
provide universal coverage to ways to
shield business from reform's high cost.
Do the governors and the business
leaders offer a bener plan to cover everyone? Not so you'd notice, and this is
where the worries begin.
About 38 million Americans have no
health coverage despite a health-care
system that consumes 14% ofthe gross
domestic product
And here's Synar's perception game
again: Any plan that excludes those
needy Americans can only be perceived
as reform. It will, in fact, be a crime.
Plenty of care available
We have a
OPPOSING VIEW social problem, not a health problem. Care is

were their religious mantra. What they
avoid discussing is

Farrakhan's racist 'truth'
only inflames, divides
If anyone expected Louis Farrakhan
to apologize for the racist remarks last
fall of a spokesman for his Nation of Islam, they didn't get it Thursday.
While Farrakhan dismissed KhaLtd
Abdul Muhammad as a spokesperson,
the thrust of his own remarks was a slap
at anyone who doesn't share his peculiar
vision of the truth.
That includes black members of Congress and mainstream civil nghts groups
who last September extended an olive
branch to Farrakhan in hopes of creating
a united front to attack black-on-black
crime and other problems in the cities.
While Farrakhan condemned "the
manner" in which Muhammad reviled
Jews as "bloodsuckers," mocked the
pope, attacked homosexuals and called
for South African blacks to kill all whites
there, he stood by "the truthi" of what
Muhammad said.
In short it wasn't that what Muhammad said was wrong, only how he said it
Indeed, Farrakhan. in announcing
Muhammad's dismissal, added to the
insult by asking Jews to repent of their
w icked ways while warning of wider separations berween people. '"Allah." he
said, "does not desire the nghteous to
keep company with the wicked."
Such divisive rhetoric plays upon the
frustration of young urban blacks confronted by societalracism.It aggravates
current tensions between blacks and
Jews on issues from affirmative action
to dealings with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
And that is indefensible.
Farrakhan showed Thursday he
wants only to divide — blacks from
Jews, blacks from whites, and blacks of
the Nation of Islam from other blacks.
For that he merits only scom.
Answers to differences come from
people of good will making compromises, not some all-knowing prophet —
be he Louis Farrakhan or David Koresh
— delivering a take-it-or-die vision.
Inflaming hatred is never an answer.

�Madison S&L funds
paid CUnton loan
Whitewater channeled money,
Leach shows with documents
By Paul M. Rodriguez
THE WHSMINGTON TIMES
Funds from the faltering Madison
Guaranty Savings and Loan Association were funneled through Whitewater Development Corp. to make a
payment on a loan to Gov. Bill Clinton
in 1985, according to documents released yesterday by the ranking Republican on the House Banking
Committee.
The money transfer "underscores
that then-Gov. Clinton had personal
liabilities reduced by a payment
from Madison," Iowa Rep. Jim Leach
said in an accompanying statement.
"Such payment presumably carries ethical as well as tax implications and is part and parcel of the
$47 [million] to $60 million estimated taxpayer loss at Madison," he
said.
The White House declined to comment yesterday.
Mr. Leach, who has been probing
the Whitewater-Madison matter
since last year, said he was releasing
the material to underscore his concerns about continued stonewalling
by federal bank regulators who have
declined thus far to cooperate with
his investigation.
The documents establish for the
first time the source of a previously
reported — but still unexplained —
pav me r.t of $7,322.42 on the Clinton
loan by Madison owner James B.
McDougal. Mr. McDougal and his
wife, Susan, were partners with Bill
and Hillary Clinton in Arkansas'
Whitewater Devlopment Corp.
The source, the documents reveal,
was a $7,500 deposit in a Whitewater
account from Madison Marketing, a
subsidiary of the S&L that was run
by Mrs. McDougal. Madison Guaranty failed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of about $50 million.
The documents show:
• On Oct. 31, 1985, Whitewater
had a bank balance of $12.49, and yet
a check signed by Mr. McDougal for
$7,322.42 was wntten on Nov._7,1985,
on the Whitewater account to Secunty Bank of Paragould, Ark., as a
payment on Mr. Clinton's loan.
That Clinton loan, made in 1983 in
the amount of $20,800, was used to
pay off the remaining balance of a
$30,000 loan to Mrs. Clinton from
Madison Bank and TVust in 1980 to
build a modular home at Whitewater.
• On Nov. 8, the day after the
McDougal-Whitewater check for
$7,322.42 was written, a $7,500 deposit in the Whitewater account was
made by Madison Marketing to
cover the check Mr. McDougal had
sent as a loan payment for Mr. Clinton. A Federal Home Loan Bank
Board exam said Madison Marketing was largely a sham corporation
owned by Mrs. McDougal until 1986.
Mr. Leach said he would not characterize these transacuons as illegal
but as a "possible" diversion of taxpayer funds "on a deferred basis'
see LO.YN, page A8
LOAN
From page A1
that should be closely scrutinized.
He said he based his conclusion
on a Banking Committee Republican
staff memorandum, which was released yesterday along with a letter
to Roger C. Altman, the interim head
of the Resolution Thist Corp. (RTC),
urging his recusal from any probe of
the Whitewater-Madison affair.
The undated staff memo to Mr.
Leach said that, "based on documentary evidence available to the minority, it appears that Madison Marketing served, in at least one instance,
as a conduit of funds from Madison
Guaranty to Whitewater and Governor Clinton."
" I f this is correct, it would appear
that insured funds from the failed
Madison Guaranty were diverted
and directly benefitted the governor
and his investment in Whitewater, a
claim Clinton had denied," the memo
said.
According to a 1987 article in Arkansas Business, a Little Rock publication, Madison Marketing was actually a fictitious name for Madison
Financial Corp- (MFC), Madison
Guaranty's real estate operation.
Mrs. McDougal also ran Master
Marketing, a sole proprietorship
whose office originally was at 1310
Main St., the office of MFC, Arkansas Business reported.
Mrs. McDougal, as the head of
Master Marketing, was the recipient
of a $300,000 Small Business Administration loan, a third of which ultimately ended up in Whitewater. The
loan, which was never repaid, was
illegally obtained, according to former Little Rock Judge David L Hale
who says he was pressured by Mr.
McDougal and Mr. Clinton to direct
the loan to Mrs. McDougal.
Mr. Hale, under indictment for defrauding the SBA on unrelated loans,
said all three were aware that Mrs.
McDougal was not qualified for the
loan but knew that she could qualify
for it — on paper — as a female applicant
Mr. Leach, in his strongly worded
letter to Mr. Altman, for the first
time also raised ethical issues about
having a top U-easury Department
official heading the RTC investigation of Whitewater-Madison while
serving as a political appomtee of
President Clinton.
The RTC is the lead independent
federal agency responsible for investigating failed savings and loans.
" I have high regard for your personal integrity, but as you know,
from the beginning, it has been an
awkward situation to have a presidentially appomted and confirmed
officer of the "D-easury Department
also head an independeni iederal
agency, the RTC," Mr. Leach said in
his letter to Mr. Altman.
"When this prospect was first
suggested at the beginning of the
Clinton administration, it did not
strike the [GOP] minority as overly
unreasonable for a month or rwo
given the fact that no RTC head had
been selected," his letter said
"However, it has been over a year
since the administration has been vr.
office and it can only be desenbed
as structurally unseemly fora polit:
cal appomtee of an executive branch
department to make what are in ef
feet, law enforcement decisions for
an independent federal agency m
they touch upon the president." Ntr
Leach wrote.
The Iowa Republican has been
pushing for hearings into tne
Whitewater-Madison affair over the
objection of House Democrats He
also has been trying — unsuccessfully so far — to get relevant documents on Whitewater Madison
from federal agencies, such as the
RTC.
House Democrats have appeared
in recent days to be softening their
opposition to hearings on whr.ewater-Madison as pan of a manda
tory oversight review of the RTC re
quired every six months.
Mr. Leach said in his letter that he
was still trying to work out arrange
ments with banking agencies to get
documents, and hoped the RTC is at
least pursuing all leads involving
Whitewater-Madison, including any
White House documents tumed over
recently to the Justice Depanment
by the White House.
These White House documents
have not been released by the Jus
tice Department because they are
covered by a federal subpoena and
thus are protected by strict secrecy
rules.
Some of these documents are believed to include confidential reports prepared by White House
Deputy Counsel Vincent W. Foster
Jr., a friend and personal lawyer to
the Clintons, who committed suicide
in July.
" I f the White House chooses to
use the Justice Departmem to shield
Whitewater documents not only
from the pubbc and Congress, but
from other govemment agenaes,
such as the RTC, which have legitimate public law enforcement responsibilities, it is hard to believe a
responsible resolution of the issues
involved can be made by regulatory'
authonties," Mr. Leach said.
He also said that "time is clearly
of the essence for the RTC to make
judgments" about any investigation
because the statute of limitations for
certain kinds of civil penalities will
be ninning out at the end of February.

�Sessions says White House
'compromised' Foster probe
By Michael Hedges
THE mSH'NGTON TIMES
2
The FBI invesbgation of Deputy
White House Counsel Vincent W.
Foster Jtfs July 20 suicide was " compromised from the beginning" by
the White House and the Justice Department, former FBI Director William Sessions said.
"The relationship between the
White House and the FBI at the time
of Mr. Foster's death should be
looked at in the context of known
events which had political implications," Mr. Sessions said in a statement first reponed by the New York
Post.
Mr. Sessions' remarks come amid
Justice Department refusals to release documents on the Foster suicide, lingering questions over the
White House's role in the FBI probe
and a prominent columnist's report
that a candidate for special counsel
tumed down the job when he could
not get assurances of cooperation.
"The FBI in May and June of 1993
had already been involved in the
"fravelgate' affair that re-erupted
when FBI agents had been summoned to the White House without
my knowledge," Mr. Sessions said in
a two-page, handwritten statement.

White House wanted to limit this
case to the Park Police," a former
Justice official said. "The bureau
was brought in for cover, but the
agents were not allowed to do their
jobs. The agents complained about
it."
The U.S. Park Police became the
lead agency in the case because Mr.
Foster died at Fort Marcy, a small,
roadside park in Northern Virginia
that is under Park Police jurisdiction.
Soon after the suicide, White
House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum
cited executive privilege in preventing Park Police and FBI agents from
searching Mr. Foster's office. The
Washington Times reported in December.
Mr. Nussbaum also blocked Park

William Sessions says polttics got in
the way of the suicide investigation.
"The White House and Justice Department were clearly in a politically awkward position with the FBI
'TVavelgate' investigation in July
1993."
Mr Sessions' statement corresponds with those of current and forPolice and FBI investigators from
examining Mr. Foster's personal papers and belongings when they went
to the White House on July 22.
The agents were ordered to sit in
a hallway while staff officials went
through the documents. The White
House officials put several items in
a box to be delivered to Mr. Nussbaum's office, and an FBI agent was
repnmanded when he stood up to
peer into the room.
Investigators who went to Mr. Foster's home also were tumed away.
Mr. Sessions' remarks on TVavelgate referred to the White House's
firing of seven employees in its
travel office. In an unprecedented
move, the FBI issued a statement
sayuig that it was investigating the
case, supporting White House justifications for the dismissals.
The matter is under investigation
by the Justice Department.

death has become controversial in

mer FBI and Justice Depanment officials who had told The Washington
Times of interference by the White
House and Justice Depanment in
the bureau's work in the Foster investigation.
Mr. Sessions was fired as FBI director July 19 — the day before Mr.
Foster killed himself — after a department review of ethics accusations. In his statement, he said the
FBI's compromised role in the Foster probe and the White House travel
office scandal prompted his comments on leaving the bureau: that he
"would not be part of politicizing the
FBI, from within or without."
An FBI spokesman said yesterday
that the bureau would have no comment on Mr. Sessions' statement

�REPORT
Parties split on issue of heami
By J. Jennings Moss
me HHSHINGTO* TIMES
\,
House and Senate members broke
along largely panisan lines when
asked by The Washington Times
whether Congress should hold hearings into the Whitewater-Madison
affair.
Joining the 177 Repubbcans who
said they would support heanngs
were nine Democrats — including
one commmee chairman, Rep. Dan
Glickman of Kansas, who heads the
InteUigence Committee.
Several senior Democrats and
comnuttee chairmen said privately
that hearings were inevitable and
that postponing hearings could hurt
them
Meanwhile, 120 Democrats and
11 Republicans and one independent
who chose to answer a telephone survey by The Washington Times said
hearings were not necessary at this
time. But many held out the prospect
that a review of the matter could be
warranted in the future.
In the survey to all S39 senators,
representatives and delegates, 190
Democrats and 31 Republicans either had no comment or did not respond. There is one vacancy in the
House.
The partisan break is not surprising, as the issue revolves around
business dealings President Clinton,
a Democrat, had while he was governor of Arkansas during the 1980s.
But some Democrats are becoming increasingly nervous about the
potential fallout their stand against
hearings could have as some Republicans are usinc every opportunity to
try to force mc issue.
"Some say Madison S&L should
not be singled out, just because the
new president may have been involved. But that's precisely why we
should. Special scrutiny is necessary whenever a high public official
is involved, even when lesser-known
persons may have done similar
things and escaped the glare of public attention," said Rep. Emest Jun
Istook, Oklahoma Repubbcan.
But most Democrats argue that
hearings are either not needed or
would be premature because the
special counsel appointed to probe
the matter for possible criminal activities has just begun his work. The
Republican clamor for a congressional probe, they say, is largely a
political ploy to hurt the president.
"Whitewater deals with allegations concerning activities that took
place long before Bill Clinton became president," said Rep. Bill Wise,
West Viiguiia Deniocrat. " I f it's a
Republican strategy to hold hearings with the idea of embarrassing
Bill Clinton, I think it may backfire."
The maner, which has become
known in Washington shorthand as
WhitewaterMadison, involves an investment Mr. Clinton and first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton made in the
Whitewater Investment Corp., a real
estate development in the Ozarks.
The Clintons' business partners in
the venture were James B. McDougal and his wife at that time, Susan
McDougal. Mr. McDougal was the
president of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association, which
the federal govemment seized in
1989 and which cost taxpayers $50
million.
1
Investigators are questioning
Investigators are questioning '
whether Mr. McDougal spent funds '
from Madison on Whitewater and \
whether he funneled Madison
money to Mr. Clinton's gubernatorial
campaigns. They also are looking
into a $300,000 SBA loan Mrs.
McDougal received.
Even though Whitewater-Madison
surfaced during the 1992 presidential campaign, it did not explode
as an issue until last fall.
After repeated caUs by the GOP
and, ultimately, some senior Democrats, Mr. Clinton finally agreed to
the naming of a special counsel to
handle the case. Attorney General
Janet Reno appointed Robed J.
Fiske Jr., a Repubbcan, to the job.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole
of Kansas and House Minority
Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois
then proposed creating a select congressional committee to investigate
but then settled for asking for the
regular committees of jurisdiction
to handle the job.
Republicans want three committees to look into the matter — the
Banking, Small Business and Jutliciary panels. Democratic chairmen
in the House and Senate, so far, have
said no.
"There should be a congressional
inquiry into Whitewater for the same
reason that Sam Ervin conducted
one into Watergate at the same time
that a special prosecutor was also
involved. Congress should not be left
in the dark for months or years
awaiting the findings of a special
counsel," said Sen. Frank Murkowski, Alaska Republican.
Rep. Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, one of the few Republicans who
told The Times they would not support hearings now, said through a
spokesman that the special counsel
should be allowed to do his job.
If hearings are held, they would
be televised, Hutchinson spokesman
Brian O'Neel pointed out. "The congressman feels that what comes out
of those televised hearings could
jeopardize prosecutonal efforts,"
Mr. O'Neel said.
One congressional investigation
used by both sides to draw parallels
to the Whitewater-Madison issue is
the high-profile series of heanngs in
1987 into the Reagan administration's sale of arms to Iran and its aid
to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
"The congressman believes
Whitewater should be pursued in the
same manner as Iran-Contra . . .
What's good for the goose is good for
the gander," said Paul Marcone,
spokesman for Rep. James A.
H-aficant, an Ohio Democrat who
supports hearings.
Rep. Tim Johnson, South Dakota
Democrat, does not favor congressional hearings on Whitewater "besional hearings on Whitewater "because he doesn't want to do anything
that would muck up the work of the
special counsel," his spokesman
John Devereaux said.
"Look at Oliver North. His conviction was overturned because of interference by a congressional committee," Mr. Devereaux said. Mr.
North was a key figure in IranContra who testified before Congress only after receiving immunity
for his comments.
Rep. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican who backs hearings, also
invoked Mr. North's name but did so
to argue that Democrats were always eager to investigate potential
problems in the administrations of
Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
"When Obver North was the prey,
it was full steam ahead. But now it's
a case of foot-dragging," Mr. Hyde
said.
For some of the Democrats who
support hearings, they said they
were concerned about the structure
of the hearings. Some, like Rep. J
Roy Rowland of Georgia, said they
had no objection to heanngs "to
clear the air."
Many Democrats who told the
Times that they did not favor hearings now said that they could change
their minds depending on the special counsel's report.
"Holding hearings now would be
a waste of taxpayers' money. It
would be like spending money on a
private investigator when police are
already on the case. People deserve
to have their questions answered,

but I don't think they want their tax
dollars spent on overkill," said Rep.
Blanche Lambert, Arkansas Democrat.
Rep. Tferry Everett, Alabama Republican, said the special counsel
was only looking into possible criminal activity and not any civil misconduct.
"This is an egregious oversight,
and it is incumbent upon the Congress to thoroughly investigate all of
[sic] aspects of possible wrongdoing
in the WhitewaterMadison case. No
one should be above the law, not even
the president," Mr. Everett said in a
statement.
Rep. Corrine Brown, a Florida
Democrat who opposes hearings,
said singling out Madison for congressional scrutiny is wrong.
"Why are we just targeting this
S&L? This is the kind of stuff for
campaigns. Lets address the issues
the American people elected us to
do. I f we're going to investigate this

all," she said.

Clinton
Health plan loses
business support
By Karen Riley
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
7fl
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce
yesterday did an overnight flip-flop,
pulling back its support for a crucial
element of President Clinton's
health plan requiring, companies to
pay for their workers' health insur-.
ance
It was the second major blow for
the administration's health proposal
in as many days. On Wednesday, the
Business Roundtable, which represents America's largest companies, voted to endorse the Cooper
health bill, which the White House
opposes.
Facing the Chamber reversal and
the likelihood of a second day of
news reports about the health plan s
troubles, the White House moved up
the announcement on lifting the
Viemam trade embargo, a senior
White House official said. The announcement had been scheduled for
Saturday.
Asked about the business groups'
decisions, Mr. Clinton said: " I don't
know what to make of it, but I
wouldn't read too much into it. This
is the beginning of what will be a
protracted legislative discussion."
The reversal by the Chamber, the
nation's largest business organization, was partly in response to the
Roundtable's decision and came
after intense Republican lobbying.

From page A1
About 40 GOP members of Congress called and faxed Chamber officials Wednesday after learning the
content of the business group's five
pages of testimony prepared for delivery yesterday before the House
Ways and Means Committee.
"We read a copy of it and got mad
as hell," said Rep. Cass Ballenger,
North Carolina Republican. Mr. Ballenger, who owns Plastic Packaging
Inc., a $25 million company, dropped
out of the Chamber six months ago
because he disagreed with its policy
positions.
"You'd better leam the feelings of
your membership before taking [a
position] that's favorable to big business that butchers your smaller
members," Mr. Ballenger said in a
fax to the Chamber on Wednesday.
"It seems to me that the Chamber
has abandoned yet another long-held
free-enterprise principle," Rep.
John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican,
said in a lener to Chamber President
Richard Lesher.
Late Wednesday, Chamber officials drafted a new statement for
Robert PatriceUi, chairman of the
Chamber's Health and Employee
Benefits Comminee, that said, "We
cannot support any of the mandate
proposals that have been advanced
in legislation by President Clinton or
members of Congress."
The statement did note the business group's continued support for a
"system of shared responsibility
among employers, individuals and
govemment for the funding of
health insurance."
"We certainly had [the Roundtable] in mind" in drafting the statement, Mr. Patricelli said in an mterview yesterday.
But he denied that the Chamber
had reversed its position, saying the
changed testimony was the result of
an "honest error" by staff members
"We caught up with the fact that
the staff in good conscience had developed testimony [that] went well
beyond the boaru s policy." he said.
"After seeing the extent of regulation and bureaucracy, we came
reluctantly to the conclusion that we
have to oppose the president's bill,"
he said.
The Chamber's origmal testimony
called for Mr. Petricelli to say: "we
accept the proposition that employers should provide and help pay for
msurance on a phased-in basis over
time."
But that planned statement included the proposal that the employer's contribution be no more than 50
percent instead of the 80 percent in
the Clinton biU.
Mr. Clmton looks to the employer
mandate as the main source for financing health coverage.

Long before President CUnton's
decision yesterday to lift the 19-year
trade embargo on Vietnam, a number of local firms were workmg to
make the country the next Asian
economic tiger.
Vatico, a 3-year-old District consulting firm, in March received the
first business Ucense issued to a U.S.
firm by the Vietnamese govemment
in 40 years. The company now has
offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh
City.
Mr. Clinton formaUy announced

there," he said. In addition, Viemam
will not enjoy favorable tariff treatment under U.S. trade laws, which
means that hefty import taxes will
make manufacturing in Vietnam unprofitable.
The upshot: Don't expect to see
"Made in Vietnam" any time soon on
shirts, shoes and toys sold in the local department store.
"You keep hearing from some U.S.
businesses that this will be the next
Thailand, the next Singapore, but
that's going to take sometime,"Mr.
Snyder said. "I'U be very interested
to see if some of these people carry
through with what they've been talking about."
Mr. Snyder is a parmer with the
District firm Graham & James,
which has Unked up with partners in
Hong Kong and Australia to staff an
office in Hanoi that wiU provide advice on navigating Viemam's stiUprimitive business and legal infrastructure.
Vatico, which stands for the Vietnam TVade and Investment Consulting Co., has done the prehminary
market spadework for a number of
major U.S. companies eager to tap
into the world's 12th-most-populous
market.
United Airlines said it would start
scheduled flights between Los Angeles and Ho Chi Minh City as soon
as possible upon approval by both
governments. United said its Boeing
747-400 aircraft, seating more than
400 passengers, would have a refueling stop somewhere in the Pacific,
but it did not say where.
The airline said it already has U.a.
rights to serve Vietnam through its
1986 purchase of Pam Am's Pacific
routes and will soon seek Viemamese govemment approval for the
flights.
Both Mr. Snyder and Mr. Rehmann said the early opportunities
for U.S. firms will be in helping build
up the rudimentary infrastructure
in Vietnam — the roads, bridges,
dams and communications systems
that will allow the economy to
flourish.

several years."

The Wasntfigton r^rws
fered a muted response to yesterday's embargo announcement.
"We always beUeved that the two
governments would be able to negotiate and resolve the maner," said
John Lord, spokesman for Fairfax
County-based Mobil Oil Corp.,
which has a bid to explore an oil
drilling site 175 miles southeast of
Ho Chi Minh City.
President Bush relaxed the trade
restrictions on Vietnam in 1992, allowing Mobil and other U.S. oil firms
the right to do prehminary drilling
for oil off the largely unexplored
Vietnamese coastline.
MobU's low-key reaction may reflect the still-strong passions
aroused about the prospect of normal trade relations with Vietnam,
nearly two decades after the end of
the Vietnam War.
Mobil executive Robert Asher
told a D.C. Bar luncheon last fall that
the area off the Vietnamese coast is
"one of the best places to look for
accumulations of hydrocarbons in
the world." But he added that "we
have a real concern that Mobil not be
seen moving out ahead of the pack
on the road map" to normalization.
The U.S. business community as a
whole has lobbied strongly for an
end to the embargo. A survey released yesterday estimated that
American trade and investment opportunities could reach $2.6 biUion
in the first rwo years after the Ufting
of the embargo. Within five years,
that would rise to $8 biUion, with
power generation, telecommunications, oU and gas the top prospects.
�Foreign aid overhaul allows abortion funding
By Martin Sieff
and Shu Ching Jean Chen
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
The Clinton administration yesterday unveiled a sweeping revision
of foreign aid policy that, among
other things, makes population control a policy goal and removes a
20-year ban on usmg aid money to
pay for abortions.
The proposed Peace, Prospenry

individual countries, thereby shifting vast power in allocating foreign
aid from the legislative to the executive branch.
The proposed act, which must be
approved by Congress, would also
give a new "strategic" direction to
U.S. foreign aid in the post-Cold War
world.
Rather than being used to fund
allies in the struggle against communism, aid would be used to encourage trade and democracy and
reward countries for cooperating on
international problems such as
crime, narcotics trading, the population explosion,, environmental
pollution and the abuse of human
nghts.
Although the proposed act does
not define aid allocations, senior administration officials said the current high levels of aid to Israel and
Egypt, running at over $3 billion a
year each, would remain unchanged.
U.S. assistance to Africa, which
runs at $800 million a year through
the Development Fund for Africa,
and Democracy Act is designed to
streamline U.S. aid, development
and relief programs in the post-Cold
War world. It is the most ambitious
reform of foreign aid attempted
since the 1961 Foreign Assistance
Act.
"We have ... moved global issues
into the mamstream of Amencan
foreign policy," Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said at a State
Department briefing.
"The core goals of the new act
include the protection of the environment and the stabilization of population growth."
The reform would streamline a
vast collection of separately enacted
amendments or programs under six
"titles." It would drastically curtail
the widely criticized congressional
pracuce of "earmarking" funds for
will also remain uncut, J. Brian Atwood, director of the Agency for Intemational Development (AID), said
at the briefing.
But aid to developing countries in
Latin America and Asia is expected
to be slashed, and top administration
officials said other aid programs
would be conditional on the willingness of recipient countries to cooperate with the Clinton administration in their domestic policies.
" I think that the most significant
thing reflected here [in the proposed
act] is that there is a requirement
that we look at whether or not recipient nations are good partners of the
United States in the development
process," said Richard Moose, undersecretary of state for management.
AID has already closed 21 overseas field missions, Mr. Atwood said.
Many of those missions were in
countries that failed to measure up
to the administration's criteria in
their domestic policies, he added.
"They were abusing human
rights, they were not interested in
democracy, and their per capita income levels were falling. And we
didn't feel we had a chance to develop the kind of partnership that
would allow us to be effective," Mr
Atwood said.
World population control will be a
policy priority for directing U.S. aid.
Mr. Moose said. The Climon adrmn
istration believes lowering world
reproducion rates is vital to prevent
ing future famines and political instability, he said.
"There's a very serious problem
that is on the horizon here with respect to food security," Mr Moose
said. "We are now seeing the leveling
of food production in the world as
the population increases. This is
contributing to instability."
The proposed wordine of the new
bill upset some conservative cntics
on Capitol Hill.
Rep. Henry J. Hyde, Illinois Republican, charged in a House For
eign Affairs Committee heanng yesterday moming that the language of
one section of the bill, Section "203.
nullified an amendment proposed
by him and passed by Congress m
1973 that forbids U.S. aid money to
be used to direaly pay for abortions
"You've taken out a specific profu
bition against subsidizing abortions
overseas with foreign aid money
You've taken that out and you've replaced it with language that hasn't
any reference to it at all," Mr Hyde
said.
Abortion "is not the most favored
[administration] way of accom '
plishing birth control, or indeed population control," Mr. Atwood said
But he added that the U.S. government believed "as a matter of pohcy .
• . that women around the world '
ought to have the right to choose, and
ought to have access to a full range
of reproductive health services."
Apart from the abortion issue, Mr
Atwood faces other major problems ,
in winning congressional approval i
for the bill.
j
Congress may resist giving "to an
unelected bureaucracy, federal
authority to spend dollars any way
they want," said Rep. David R. Obey,
Wisconsin Democrat, shortly before
the draft plan was sent to Capitol
Hill.
"There will be no blank checks," j
added Mr. Obey, who is chainnan of j
the House Appropriations subcom- j
mittee on foreign operations.
i
The prospect of overall budget
cuts may also prevent the administration from achieving its foreign
aid goals.

Kerry denies cover-up on POWs
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
Sen. John Kerry, chairman of a
Senate committee that investigated
POWs, covered up information contained in U.S. intelligence reports indicating American prisoners were
left behind in Viemam as late as
1989, according to a published report.
Mr. Kerry, Massachusetts Democrat, reportedly told four Senate
POW investigators that if information uncovered in 1992 about the existence of American POWs in Vietnam leaked out, "you'll wish you'd
never been bom," according to a report in the forthcoming issue of the
American Spectator.
Mr. Kerry dismissed the accusations as "based on distorted documents."
"it reads iike a fantasy. It's totally
inaccurate," Mr. Kerry said of the
article.
"They didn't even give us the courtesy of a call to check facts. It is
typical of the kind of journalism that
has exploited veterans and their
families and it is time for it to stop,"
he said in a statement.
A Kerry spokeswoman attributed
accusations made in the Spectator
article to several staff members of
the Senate Select Committee on
POW-MIA Affairs who were dismissed. Mr. Kerry was chairman of
the panel, which completed its work
last year.
The Spectator report also quotes
a CIA document uncovered recently
indicating the agency believed some
American POWs were held in a secret prison-camp system separate
from camps known to U.S. intelligence.
The separate system may account
for new repons from Russia that
hundreds of POWs were never returned home after the war, according to the article.
Thf- possibility American POWs
were held at secret locations in Vietnam "cannot be disregarded," the
CIA document states.
That CIA analysis undermines a
recent Pentagon study of the Russian archival document uncovered
last year in Moscow indicating Vietnam secretly kept up to 700 American POWs after the war.
The analysis by U.S. intelligence
dismissed the Russian document as
"erroneous" because "we found no
evidence of an additional [pnson]
system."
In the magazine report, John
Corry, a former reponer for the New
York Times, said the Defense Intelligence Agency systematically has
covered up information indicating
American POWs were left behmd
after the Vietnam War.
Citing declassified documents,
the report states that the CIA believed the Viemamese may have set
up a secret prison system after the
war.
Satellite photographs, first uncovered by Senate investigators in 1992,
also revealed distress signals on the
ground in Vietnam that appeared to
be from captured U.S. fliers, according to the Spectator report.
"At the very least, they are further
proof that a cover-up has been and
still is in progi-ess," the report says.
"We have broken faith with men who
fought for their country, and we are
being blighted by an ever-widening
moral stain."

Words of wisdom a week late
By Anne Gowen
Clinton visits school
TME WASHINGTON TIMES
Carlotta Harper was disappointed that President Clinton took
a rain check on his planned appearance last week at Kramer Junior High School.
That's because Carlotta, president of Kramer's student government, was ready to do the introduction for Mr. Clinton. Butterflies
kicked in after she had a week to
think about it.
The president, recovered from
the State of the Union address sore
throat that forced his cancellation
Jan. 26, finally tumed up at the
school in the Fairlawn area of
Southeast yesterday. And he told
Carlotta not to worry.
" I had dreams I was going to
mess it up," said Carlotta, IS, a
ninth-grader.
"But it went
fine."
Mr. Clinton
seemed to
agree. Then he
talked to the
students about
family values
and mdividual
[ responsibility.
"You gotta
decide what
Spriggs
happens to
you. I can't live
your life for you," the president told
more than 350 students in an auditorium decorated with handpainted signs saying "Bill Clinton,
the Man With a Plan."
"I'm going to try and make the
streets, the schools better and the
job future better," Mr. Clinton said,
"but you also have to say, T am going to do the most I can with my
life.'
"I'm going to try to keep up my
end of the deal, and I want you to
keep up yours."
Mr. Clinton's visit came a week
after Vice President Al Gore went
to another public school in the District. Mr. Gore held an emotional
meeting with students at Dunbar
Senior High School in Northwest
Jan. 27, a day after a gunbattle between students erupted in a thirdfloor hallway there.

President Clinton mingles with Kramer Junior High students after telling them about family values yesterday.
Mr. Clinton got a better response yesterday than the vice
president received last week.
" I was inspired," said ninthgrader La-Na Robinson, 15.
"It was all nght," said Ronita
Skinner, also 15 and in the ninth
grade. " I was surprised because I
thought he was scared to come to
Southeast."
When the president didn't show
last week, Ronita said, " I was mad."
Yesterday, the students were
ready again. Some sported their
Sunday best. The flags were
fluffed; the bathrooms smelled
like Pine-Sol.
Urged to watch the president's
State of the Union address, the students had prepared questions for
him on topics ranging from the
Cfrc tflagfjmgtpn Cuncg
North American Free TVade
Agreement to the infonnation superhighway to AIDS to why Kramer doesnt have coed lunches.
Mr. Clinton begged off the last
one but quipped, "If I were you, I'd
want it too."
Coming out from behind the podium after his prepared remarks,
the president moved closer to the
teens and into one of those intimate
question-and-answer sessions he
loves. He urged the students to
stay out of gangs, stay in school,
and avoid pregnancy and unprotected sex.
"The first thing you can do is to
decide not to have a baby until
you're old enough to take care of it
and you're married," Mr. Clinton
said after someone asked about
FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 4,1994
family values.
On teen-agers who father and
abandon children, he said, "1 think
that's wrong."
Questioned about AIDS, the
president asked students who
knew someone with the disease to
raise their hands.
"Pretty good number, huh?" he
said. He pledged to increase funding for AIDS research
But in keeping with the "personal responsibilities" theme, Mr.
Clinton added, "The most important person in determining what
happens to you and AIDS is you."
Standing on the sidelines, Ward
6 D.C. Council member Harold
Brazil gave the president high
marks.
"He talked with kids, not at
them," Mr. Brazil said.
For Christmas, members of the
president's Secret Service detail
' auopteu" Kramer as a present to
the Clintons. The agents plan to
start a program for mentoring and
field trips at the school.
The agent in charge of the presidential detail, Rich Miller, grew
up in Anacostia. Supervisory
agent Danny Spriggs graduated
from Kramer in 1966.
The president's visit, Mr.
Spriggs said, "lets the kids knowthat this program is for real."
Because of the good memories
from adolescence, the agent said,
he felt a little "melancholy" being
back at Kramer.

�Mother Teresa lectures Clinton
- then Clinton lectures pupils
By Paul Bedard
r u e VWSHINGTOK TIMES
President Clinton yesterday reacted to a scolding on abortion from
Mother Tferesa by preaching "personal responsibility" to Christians
and teens and warning that careless
sex can lead to welfare and AIDS.
Mr. Clinton used speeches to the
National Prayer Breakfast and
Washington's Kramer Junior High
School to make a pact with Amencan
teens that if they abstam from
drugs, sex and crime, he'U help them
find a brighter future.
" I don't mtend to give up on you,"
he told some 200 students and faculty at the Southeast school adopted
by the U.S. Secret Service.
When student Robin Davis asked
what she could do to restore family
values, Mr. Clinton strutted into a
sermon that bashed premarital sex
and demanded that male teens consider the consequences of sex before
engaging in it.
"The first thing you can do is
make up your mind you're not going
to have a baby till you're old enough
to take care of it and until you're
married," Mr. CUnton said as he
bobbed in the audience.
"This is not a sport; this is a solemn responsibility," Mr. Clinton said
of sex. "Is it right or wrong if you're
a boy to get some girl pregnant and
then forget about it? I think it's
wrong," Mr. Clinton said in a reference to the growing number of children in the Washington area who are
having children by themselves.
He also called on young men to
stop having sex "when they're not
prepared to marry the mothers,
they're not prepared to take responsibility for the children and they're
not even able to take responsibility
for themselves."
In addition to unwanted children,
Mr. Clinton said, a byproduct of
careless sex is welfare. "One big
problem is that people get on it because they start having children
when they are young," he said.
His tough talk on sex was
condom distribution. AIDS policy director Kristine Gebbie also has
called on the nation to concede that
"sex is a good and pleasurable
thing."
His comments on sexual and personal responsibility were the strongest since he was forced off the issue
m December by reports that Arkan
sas state troopers helped facilitate
sexual trysts for the former Arkan
sas governor even after he was
elected president.
The difference in his rhetoric and
actions was evident earlier yesterday when Mr. Clinton told the National Prayer Breakfast that there
will be always be "differences" between his view and those cf pro-life
Christians.
Mother Tteresa of Calcutta used
her address immediately before the
president's to decry abomon poli
cies. The Clmton administration
funds both domestic and foreign
abortion programs.
" I feel the greatest destroyer of
peace today is abortion because Jesus said, Tf you receive a little child,
you receive me.' So every abortion is
the denial of receiving Jesus, the neglect of receiving Jesus," she told a
crowd of some 2,000 gathered in the
ballroom of the Washington Hilton.
Mr. Clinton supported abortion
rights during the 1992 presidential
campaign but was a firm opponent
before running for office and seek
ing the support of the pro-choice
movement. In a Sept. 26,1986, letter
to the Arkansas Right to Life Committee, for example, he said: " I am
opposed to abortion and to govern
ment funding of abortions."
"Js it right or wrong
if you're a boy to get
some girl pregnant
and then forget about
it? I think it's wrong."
— President Clinton
matched by concerns raised on the
spread of AIDS. "AIDS is spread primarily in two ways, because of drug
users using unsafe needles and because of unsafe sex — primarily homosexual sex," he said.
While Mr. Clinton's comments
were hailed for their strong message
on family values, they also displayed
anew the gap between the president's rhetoric and his administration's actions.
hor example, although he was essentially preaching abstinence, Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and
his AIDS czar have been calling for
East, Central Europe on edge
over rise of Russian nationalism
By Andrew Borowiec
THE VWSHINGTON TIMES
V
GENEVA — Fear of Russian nationalism increasingly dominates
foreign policy in Eastern and Central Europe, whose leaders believe
the end of the Cold War has created
a dangerous securiry vacuum in
their area.
Europe experts and some intelligence reports say NATO's "Partnership for Peace" plan has served only
to heighten the anxiety in Eastern
and Central European capitals.
The parmership project, offered
in lieu of full members*"-- v? NAT
*
has been reluctantly accepted by Lhe
so-called "Visegrad Four" — Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic and
Slovakia. The four nations have
formed a vague union in the Hungarian town of Visegrad but have yet to
draft a cominon strategy.
The four also feel thwarted by the
12-nation European Union, formerly
the European Community, which has
been slow in responding to their political and trade overtures.
Jacques Delors, president of the
European Commission, which is the
union's executive body, said he favors a "greater Europe" and the integration of Moscow's former satellites.
This week Poland and Hungarysigned association agreements with
the union but received no solid guarantees Polish Pnme Minister Waln
demar Pawlak, who was in Brussels
yesterday, said the lack of tangible
progress fuels instability in Eastern
Europe.
A German research institute report pointed out that the countries
previously bound together by the
Warsaw Pact are now adrift and deprived of any security umbrella.
French analysts say that while
Russian foreign policy is becoming
increasingly nationalist, the West
has generally remained ambiguous
and, in efTect, tacitly accepts Russia's nght to create a zone of influence over Eastern Europe.

rope" but deprived of membership
or even formal association with the
Nonh Atlantic Hreaty Organization,
the former Soviet satellites now consider themselves to be an "unofficial
and undetermined buffer zone" between Russia and the West, accordmg to one Polish assessment.
The endless turmoil in former
Yugoslavia weighs heavily on Eastem European efforts to end the political and security vacuum. Tb many
Eastern European capitals, what is
happening in the Balkans proves
that frontiers can still be changed by
force — and with impunity.
Poland is particularly concerned
about Ukraine's slide toward anarchy and economic disaster, with an
inflation rate of 10,000 percent annually, a lack of tangible reforms and
general penury. •
In such a situation, Poland ana
lysts say, Ukraine might soon need
"Russian protection" — as did the
republic of Georgia when it turned
to Russia to help end a rebellion
German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel, reflecting the Bonn government's concern over the area, recently proposed a "good neighbor
hood treaty" between Ukraine and
Russia. He also urged the European
Union to sign "association pacts
with Eastern countries "as soon as
possible."
Alain Lamassoure, the French
minister of European affairs, vowed
during a recent trip to the Baltic region that "the secunty of the Baltic
states is part of European secunry"
Besides fear of Russia, the former
Soviet republics and satellites are
plagued by pohtical instability, economic difficulties, mihtary' insufficiency and a massive increase in organized crime.
Helene Carrere d'Encausse. a
French pohtical analyst, pointed to
the success of neo-communists in
last year's elections in Poland and
Lithuania and the continuing communist role in Romania and Bulgaria.
She stressed that Russia, which
inherited the bulk of the Soviet military might, has revised its plans to
reduce its armed forces to 1.5 milhon men, opting for the higher figure of 2.1 million men.

�Reinve ' ig sav* gs: Mo ey o be spent elsewhere
By Greg Pierce
THE VMSHINQTON l i M i S
Vice President Al (lore said the
twin missions of his National Performance Review were to make govemment "work betterand cost less "
Five months later, it is clear that
whatever the virtues of Mr. Gore's
plan, cutting the deficit won't be one
of them. Whatever money is saved
will be spent elsewhere — perhaps
several limes over.
"It's like the peace dividend. Everyone has his own ideas on how to
spend it," said Scott Hodge, chief
budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation.
How much money the administration and Congress can free up for
other spending remains murky, although a rough outline can be discerned in the bottom row of Con-
Krcssional Itudgct OiTicc numbers.
Tiie amount will be far less lhan the
$1(18 billion over five years thai Mr
Gore promised.
"It was very obvious that those
figures were significantly exaggerated. No way they could get to $108
billion," said a congressional staffer
involved in the issue.
Elaine Kamarck of the Office of
the National Performance Review
said yesterday, "We are exactly on
target for 1995 savings, and the budget will show that."
Ms. Kamarck played down criticism that "reinventing government" will not reduce the budget
deficit. "Savings are savings. We
never said this was for deficit reduction."
The administration's budget, due
to be released Monday, will show
that the performance review will
meet its fiscal IW5 goat tif saving
$12 6 billion, Ms Kamarck said
Many proposals to "reinvent government" are vague — such as "im
prove NASA contracting practices"
— and the administration admitted
as much in its report. The savings
from that and many other recommendations were marked "Cannot
Be Estimated" and have never been
given dollar figures.
The General Accounting Office,
in a December report, pointed to the
vagueness of some proposals.
"Despite its wide scope, the NPR
report contained some recommendations that were too general for us
to comment," Comptroller General
Charles Bowsher wrote. The GAO
said it was unable to assess 121 proposals — almost a third of Mr. Gore's
384 recommendations.
The administration's most con-
crete prupowil is to pare the (ederal
work force by 252.000 over five
years The Congressional Hudget
Office estimated a savings of $36.7
billion over five years. Other estimates were as low as $20 billion.
Congress has begun spending
that money before deciding how to
separate those workers from iheir
paychecks.
"The White House needs those
savings to comply with the discretionary spending caps enacted in
last year's budget deal," Mr. Hodge
said, referring to the ceiling on defense appropriations and myriad
other programs not mandated by
law, "so they don't want to use it for
deficit reduction."
Ms. Kamarck confirmed that
NPR savings will help the administration meet the budget caps.
Congress has its own ideas on how
lhe money should be spent
In November, Ihe Senate voted to
use $22 3 billion from personnel cuts
to create an anti crime trust fund.
The money would be used to build
prisons and put 100,000 more police
on the nation's streets.
Efforts lo use the expected savings for deficit reduction have been
foiled by the administralion and congressional leaders. In the fall, Sen.
Phil Gramm, Itexas Republican, persuaded the Senate to approve an
amendment requiring the administration to make the personnel cuts.
The savings, said at the lime to
total $21.8 billion, would have paid
for emergency unemployment benefits.
Although the House voted 27:5-146
to instruct its conferees to accept the
Gramm amendment, the conference
committee eliminated the measure.
Democratic leaders killed it again
after (he House voted to restore it.
A similar effort by Reps. Timothy
J. Penny, Minnesota Democrat, and
John R Kasich, Ohio Republican,
failed by a 219-213 margin after f uri
ous lobbying by the administration
and the Democratic leadership.
Sen. William Roth. Delaware Republican, wrote lhat he was "dumbfounded" when the While House objected to his atlempt lo mandate
personnel cuts and use the savings
to trim the deficit.
In a Nov. 19 letter to James B.
King, director of the Office of Per
sonnel Managemeni, Mr. Rolh said.
"So what is the problem?... Ilis that
some in the administration may not
be fully committed to the second
promise of National Performance
Review — that govemmem cost
less."
Senators want panel to rate video g m s
a eVIDEO V
By Betsy Pisik
THE WASHINOTON HUES
Sen. Joseph I . Lieberman has pushed
the "start" button in the congressional
war on violent and sexually explicit
video games.
The Connecticut Democrat yesterday
put the finishing touches on a bill to create a 5-person federal commission, appointed by the president, to oversee development ofa uniform rating system for
video and computer games. Co-sponsored by Sen. Herb Kohl, Wisconsin
Democrat, the bill was undergoing final
revisions and was to be formally introduced last night
The panel would include "people who
are familiar with the game industry, but
are independant" of it, Mr. Lieberman
said yesterday in an interview. He also
hopes the group will include child psychologists "and just plain parents," he
said.
The proposed Video Game Rating Act
of 1994 calls for the immediale creation
of the commission, which would spend ils
first year helping the industry craft its
own ratings system. The commission
would have the power to approve the plan,
or to reject it and write its own.
Mr. Lieberman said he hopes the
threat of a govemment board taking over
will be enough to prod the industry to
deliver on its recent promise to create a
fair, consistent and accessible ratings
system, much like Hollywood's way of
labeling movies as suitable for children
or adults.
The video game industry's most powerful players — including Sega, Nintendo
and Electronic Arts — have formed a
loose coalition to work on a ratings plan,
and havealready met at least twice. More
meetings are planned before the first
hearing on Mr. Lieberman's bill in March.
"We've been working closely with Sen
ators Lieberman and Kohl and I feel the
industry is moving togelher . . . at a
pretty fast clip," said Perrin Kaplan, corporate communications manager for
Nintendo of America.
The commission's members would
work part » ie and would be paid a per
From page B8
diem based on an annual salary level of
$107,000, or about $400 a day Mr. Lieberman said this is the lowest regulatory
salary allowed by law.
"If we could get volunteers to do it, we
would," said the senalor. "But we can't."
Game publishers would pay a fee to
offset the commission's expenses, which
one of Mr. Lieberman's aides estimated
would be "less than $1 million" a year.
The industry leadei, Nintendo, says it
purged gratuitious sex and violence
from its games eight years ago. Sega, the
No. 2 player in Ihe $6 billion a year video
game industry, started a three-tiered rating system this summer.
see VIDEO, page B12
Mr. Lieberman fin;t called for the
creation of a video game ratings
board in early December, saying
that parents want to know which
games are excessively violent or
sexually suggestive.
In the resulting outcry, retailers
such as Tbys "R" Us pulled at least
one game, "Night TVap," from its
shelves, and Sega, tho game's manufacturer, took the game off the market for editing and possible rerelease.
That game, produced by one of
Sega's subsidiaries, was released on
the highly realistic CD-ROM format,
and more closely resembles the Itrated film it once was than, say, a
"Sonic the Hedgehog" cartridge. It
pits blood-draining intruders
against lingerie-clad victims.
The game's creator, Ibm Zito,
calls "Night TTap" a parody of Bgrade horror movies and complains
news reports have misrepresented
it The game is being re-edited, Sega
officials said, to emphasize the humor.
In the past two monihs violent
video games have been featured on
Ihe nightly news and debated on daytime talk shows. The issue was also
the buzz al the Winter Consumer
Electronics Show, when the coalition
had its startup meeting.
Members of the Interactive Entertainment Induslry Ratings Syslem Commitiee, which also includes
Acclaim Entertainment Inc., Atari
Games and 3DO Corp-, among others, is working with retailers and arcade operators to decide how to
stmcture a ratings system. They
hope to submit a plan by early 199S,
industry spokesmen say, although
Mr. Lieberman is pressing them for
one by summer.
But even that is a compromise for
the senator.
"If I had my druthers I would pass
a law that . . . would prohibit the
worst of this violence and sex," he
said yesterday. "But I think it would
probably violate the First Amendment."
�Unanimous vote Looser controls
confirms Perry as on computer sales
new defense chief abroad criticized
By Bill Genz
TXE W»SHINGTO\ TIMES
The Senate voted unanimously
last night to confirm William J.
Perry as secretary of defense, replacing outgoing Pentagon chief Les
Aspin.
In a 97-0 vote, the Senate ended an
embarrassing effon by President
Clinton to replace Mr. Aspm, who
was forced to resign in December
over budget disputes and for failing
to send armor in support of U.S.
troops in Somaha.
Mr. Perry was swom in as the 19th
defense secretary at an informal
ceremony last night at the Pentagon.
His wife, Lee, Mr. Aspin and Army
Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Suff, were
present.
Retired Adm. Bobby Ray Inmao
withdrew as the nominee for the
post on Jan. 18, claiming in a nationally televised news coni^i ence that
Republicans and newspaper columnists conspired to smear his reputation.
Mr. Perry's official duties begin
this weekend when he travels to Munich to take pan in an annual international securiry policy conference
attended by senior govemment officials.
On "niesday, he is scheduled to
testify before Congress about the
Pentagon's fiscal 1995 defense budget, which will be released Monday.
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, in remarks
on the Senate floor, praised Mr.
Perry, 66, as an expen in national
security issues who "has shown high
standards of personal conduct and
integrity."
"The record clearly shows that
Bill Perry is highly qualified to be
secretary' of defense," Mr. Nunn
said.
Sen. Strom Thurmond, South
Carolina Republican and ranking
minonty member of the Armed Services Committee, said Mr Perry, a
weapons procurement official in the
Caner administration, was in the
forefront of modernizing US
forces.
Mr. Perry is known as the key developer of radar-evading stealth
technology
" I hope Dr Perry's appointment to
the position of secretary will begin
a new era of consultation and cooperation between the Department of
Defense and the White House," Mr.
Thurmond said. "Over the past several months I have been concerned
about the lack of focus and support
President Clinton has given his national secunty team and the defense
issues."
The Senate has confirmed Mr.
Perry three times before for lesser
positions in the Pentagon, rwice during the Carter administration and
last year for the deputy defense secretary post.
Absent from the vote yesterday
were Republicar Sens. John McCain
of Arizona, Don Nickles of Okla- \
homa and Ited Stevens of Alaska.
Mr. Perry told the Senate Armed !
Services Committee on Wednesday
that he has a very different personality than Mr. Aspm but that his views \
on key defense issues are very simi
lar.
The new defense secretary said at !
his nomination hearing that he is
very worried about heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula and
will use a "carrot and stick" to keep
North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.
He said he proposed and approved
a joint US -China defense conversion commission that will be codirected by himself and Lt. Gen.
Dmg Henggao, Beijing's top international arms dealer.
He also said he must deal with a
$20 billion shortfall in defense funds
needed m the next six years to pay
for programs designed to keep U.S.
forces capable of fighting rwo regional conflicts at nearly the same
time.
One of his top priorities will be to
assure that U.S. military field commanders get the suppon they need
and to prevent budget cuts from producing "hollow" military forces in
the commg years.

THE WHSHINGTON TIMES
The Clinton administration has
further relaxed controls on the export of computers destined fbr former Soviet bloc countries and China
by aUowing the sale of more powerful computers without Pentagon
clearance.
The change, which went into effect Dec. 30, came less than three
months after a more broadly based
easing of export controls to make it
easier for computer manufacturers
to compete in overseas markets.
Proponents of the latest move,
chiefly in the industry and the Commerce Department, argue that it
"levels the playing field" so that U.S.
computer makers can better compete with their foreign counterpans
on the world market.
"The less [govemment] agency
review, the less red tape, the better
off we're going to be," said Craig
Garcia, the manager of intemational
trade affairs with the American
Electronics Association.
Opponents, chiefly weapons proliferation experts, accuse the administration of giving away too much
computer technology too quickly.
They fear that countries hostile to
the United States and its allies —
Iran, Iraq, Syria and North Korea
among them — will get access to
high-tech know-how that will be
used for miUtary purposes.
"We're letting go of a whole lot of
balloons with no abiUty to track
them when they're out of sight," said
Jon B. Wolfsthal, a senior analyst
with the private Arms Control Association.
In the latest easing of restrictions,
the Commerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration
served notice to the Pentagon in a
Dec. 30 memo that it no longer wiU
ask the Defense Department to clear
for export to former Soviet bloc
countnes and China computers that
have a power less than 1,000 milUons
of theoretical operations per second,
or MTOPS.
The Pentagon's Defense Ttechnology Security Administration, which
is charged with reviewing export Ucenses for high-tech items to guard
against their miUtary application by
hostile countries, concurred with
the decision in a Jan. 11 memo to
Commerce. Both memos were obtained by The Washington Times.
The previous limit on securing
Pentflgon cleiiiwiu. for ccinpu.t."
exports had been 500 MTOPS. By
comparison, a desktop computer
with the Intel 486 processor chip
that is widely sold in the United
States is 12.4 MTOPS.
" I think this shows that this ad-
ministration has taken the wrong
rum on expon controls and has not
understood the entire issue of nonproliferation and has not understood
the relationship of computers to creating an indigenous mdustrial capabiUty for use for weapons of mass
destruction," said Kenneth Timmerman, an independent security consultant.
The relaxation followed a Dec. 15
decision by the Pans-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
Export Controls to raise from 67 to
260 MTOPS the level at which export
Ucenses are required for computers.
The United States had wanted to
raise the limit to 500 MTOPS,
sources said
About the same time, the United
States and Japan agreed to redefine
the meaning of supercomputer to
apply to machine;; that can run at
1,500 MTOPS. up from 195, Commerce Depanment officials and
other sources said. The United
States still is negotiating for a 2,000MTOPS Umit. they said.
"The mtent [of the export decontrols] is to balance secunty interests
with exporting interests m a respon
sible fashion.' a senior Commerce
Department official said in a tele
phone intemew. speaking on tht
condition of anonymity. " I don'r
think that decontrol of these item.
makes a difference."
ControUmg the exports of com
puters with a capability of less thar
500 MTOPS is "not a great impediment to building weapons," the official said, refemng to national se

�Halperin
reappears
as aide
for NSC
Choice for federal bench
grilled on death penalty
By Bill Gertz
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
The National Security Council
staff has hired former Defense Department nominee Morton Halperin,
who was forced out of the Penugon
by Senate Republicans challenging
his qualifications for the post.
"We'll be hiring him as a special
assistant and senior director for democracy," said an NSC official who
declined to be named.
No date has been set for Mr. Halperin to assume his duties at the Old
Executive Office Building, the official said. But an announcement of
the appointment is expected soon.
"One of our major goals is the enlargement of democracy and Mort
will be in charge of that issue for us,"
the official said, adding that National Security Adviser Anthony
Lake, a friend of Mr. Halperin's, is
pleased to have a person of "Mort's
stature and depth" on the NSC team.
Mr. Halperin, a former Americna
Civil Liberties Union director, will
focus on the issue of expanding democracy in the world, a theme outlined by Mr. Lake in a major U.S.
strategy speech last year.
The NSC is the president's principle mechanism for coordinating all
U.S. defense and national security
policies and overseeing implementation of his policies.
Mr. Halperin will work with NSC
Counselor Richard Schifter in a new
NSC directorate that will coordinate
policies related to Central and Eastern Europe, the official said.
As part of a reorganization, Mr.
Schifter will become a deputy of a
new NSC policy-steering group on
Central and Eastern Europe that will
be headed by Peter Timoff, undersecretary of state for political affairs.
Mr. Halperin spent last year at the
Pentagon as a consultant awaiting
confirmation to the newly created
post of assistant defense secretary
for democracy and peacekeeping.
He withdrew Jan. 10 after the resignation of his friend, Defense Secretary Les Aspin, and after a bitter
confrontation in November with Re
publicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee
The Pentagon inspector general
still is investigating whether Mr
Halperin acted improperly before
confirmation by seeking to halt a
U.S. military exercise in Guatemala,
by working in an official capacity
with the Justice Department on the
i&aue of homosexuals in the military
and whether Mr. Halperin violated
Pentagon rules related to letting research contracts.
Mr. Halperin, during a Nov. 16.
hearing, was challenged by senators
to explain his views on the use of
American military power and past
views that called for elimination of
all secret U.S. intelligence activities.
The statements angered Senate
Republicans, and Mr. Halperin tried
to distance himself from the passage
dunng the November hearing.
Senate Republicans also investigated accusations made by several
CIA employees that Mr. Halperin
met overseas with renegade CIA
agent Philip Agee and a member of
a Greek terrorist group that claimed
responsibility for murdering the
CIA's station chief in Athens in 1975.

Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday grilled Florida Supreme
Court Judge Rosemary Barkett, a nominee
for the federal judiciary, about her decisions
to overrule the death penalty in several cases.
"She has more hostility to the death penalty
than any nominee I've seen up here," said Sen.
Orrin G. Hatch of Ohio, ranking Repubhcan
on the comminee, during confirmation hearings on her nomination.
But Mr. Hatch said his primary concern is
for her tendency to insert her opinions as she
interprets the law. "You can't come out of
these hearings, if you are a constitutional lawyer, without some real concern," he said.
In September, President Clinton nominated
Judge Barkett, a 54-year-old former nun, to
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the l l t h Circuit,
which has jurisdiction over Florida, Georgia
and Alabama.
Yesterday, Sen. Strom Thurmond, South
Carolina Republican, described the grisly details of several capital cases reviewed by the
Florida high court. He noted that Judge Barkett — one of seven justices — voted to overturn death sentences in each case, often in a
lone dissent.
" In case after case after case after case, six
judges are going one way and you are going
the other way that takes up for the defendant,"
Mr. Thurmond said. "That's a strange record."
Judge Barken, flanked by 35 members of
her family, repeatedly said her dissenting
opinions were few. She said that, in 3,500 opinions wrinen while she sat on the court, she
had dissented 300 times and was in the majority 85 percent of the time in criminal cases.
Moreover, the judge said she had supported
the death penalty about 270 times.
"One case — whether you agree with me or
not — cannot be fairly used to examine my
record," the judge said, adding that her opponents were distorting her record to make her
appear soft on crime.
In Flonda, judges face retention elections
every four years. Judge Barkett, appointed to
Flonda's high coun in 1985, survived a 1992
movement to unseat her based primarily on
her positions in death-penalty cases.
Some of those 1992 campaign issues were
revived by senators yesterday.
Sen. William S. Cohen, Maine Republican,
asked about a 1992 case in which a leader of
the Black Liberation Army, which sought to
start a race war by killing whites, was convicted of murdering a teenager. The BLA
leader had sent to the victim s mother a recording describing the killing.
Mr. Cohen noted that Judge Barken voted
to spare the murderer and joined an opinion
calling the case "a social awareness case" and
saying the victim "was a symbolic representation of the class causing the perceived injustice."
He said the judge's rationale troubled him
in light of the recent New Vork shooting in
which a gunman opened fired in a subway
train and killed six passengers, then explained his action as an expression of "outrage against society."
Judge Barken said ir is natural to have a
visceral disgust at the details of individual
murder cases and that desire to impose the
death penalty is a reasonable emotional response.
"But I am not permitted to respond emotionally as a judge
I must look bevond the
aggravating factors of the cnme ana not stop
there, but must look at the mitigating factors,"
she said.
"In and of itself, feeling raciaih oppressed
is not going to be a sufficient mitigating factor" to circumvent the death penalty she said,
adding that it could be sufficient as one of
several other factors.
Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr.. Delaware Democrat and Judiciary Committee chairman,
chided his colleagues for taking cases out of
context. He noted that U.S. Supreme Coun
Justice Antonin Scalia, "never thought to be a
wacky liberal," wrote a unanimous opinion
reversing the death sentence of a man who
raped his 13-year-old niece and then killed her
to cover the crime.
He said Justice Scalia overturned the death
sentence because the lower couns had not
considered mitigating factors including that
the defendant's father had died of cancer, that
the defendant had sniffed gasoline fumes as a
child and that he was one of seven poor children in his family.
Mr. Hatch said heexpects the comminee to
vote on the nomination by late this month. He
would not speculate as to whether Judge Barken will be confirmed

�Hoi se i ay ki e ca o ev e board

By Carol Innersl
IHE V4*SHING10N TlMtS
A deliberate omission in House
legislation to reauthorize the Klementary and Secondary Education
Act could scrap an independeni
panel that oversees the government's evaluations of the nation's
educational progress
The 24-member National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) was
created in 1987 to supervise the congrcssionally mandated National As
sessment of Educational Progress
(NAEP), often referred to as the "nation's report card "
On TUesday, the House Education
and Labor subcommittee on elementary, secondary and vocational education considered a bill that makes
no mention of the NAGB and turns
over control of the N AEP to the commissioner of the Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics.
The reauthorization bill moves lo
the full commitiee for debale Tues-
day and Wednesday.
The governing board has at least
one champion on lhat commillee —
Rep Michael N Castle, Delaware
Republican
"Me served on the board as governor of Delaware with Governor
(Richard] Riley, and he knows the
advantages of it," said Claire DeMattcis, Mr. Castle's press secretary.
"One of the most important things
about the board is that it involves
state and local input, and that's a feature he wants to make sure is preserved."
But Mr. Castle also is sensitive to
the proliferation of boards and commissions and may propose an
amendment that combines the
NAGB's functions with others, she
said.
Currently, the board gets about 10
percent of the NAEP's $29.3 million
budget.
"The House proposal would tum
NAEP back into a federally controlled testing program," said NAGB
Chairman Mark D. Musick, presi-
dent of the Soulhern Regional Edu
cation Hoard "And ihis, in lum.
would make it vulnerable lo paro
chial pressures and polilical de
mands.
"The assessment itself might well
be damaged or curtailed at a time
when NAEP is vitally needed in the
structure of education reform," Mr.
Musick said.
At its recent meeting in Washington, the National Governors' Association issued a statement of support
for the governing board and the controversial achievement levels the
panel has set for the NAEP
"NAGB is broadly representative
of slate and local interests, ensures
public accountability and maintains
the appropriate federal-state partnership in education decisionmaking, including the establishment
of national, not federal, performance
goals for reporting national assessment results," the governors' statement said.
The board's achievement levels
describe student performance as
"basic." "proficienl" or ' iKlvanced"
and have been a Ixme of conlention
for many congressmen and olher
critics who say lhe siandards are unreasonably high and were improp
erly set.
The House proposal contains provisions for reauthorizing the NAEP
and the Education Department's statistics center, even as it omits mention of the governing board.

Senate strikes blow for voluntary student prayer
By Carol Innerst
THE VWSHINGTON TIMES
The Senate voted yesterday to
deny federal education funds to state
agencies and local school districts
that prevent voluntary individual
prayer in public schools
The proposal, offered by Sen.
Jesse Helms, North Carolina Repub
lican, passed 75-22 on the second day
of deliberations on an education re
form bill.
"You can pinpoint when the decline of this country actually began,"
Mr. Helms said, referring to a 1962
Supreme Court decision prohibiting
state-sponsored prayer in public
school. "Since that time we have
been on the slippery slope. . . . Morality has been all but forgotten and
scoffed at in some circumstances "
In 1992, the high court declared
lhat an official prayer at a publicschool graduation violated the con
stitutional separation of church and
state, bui it left open the issue of
voluntary prayer initiated by a student. Appeals courts have interpreted the ruling as permitting this
as constitutional.
Sen. John Danforth, Missouri Republican and an Episcopal priest,
said the amendment was nothing
more than another unwanted directive from Washington.
"If we truly believe there is a
moral crisis in America, and I believe that, how many of us truly believe that the answer to that moral
crisis is on the floor of the United
Slates Senate?" he asked.
Another opponent, Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, Ohio Democrat, said:
"Forcing someone to pray is not
what this country stands for."
Mr. Helps' amendment reads:
"No fu:.ds made available
through the Department of Education . . . shall be available to any state
or local educational agency which
has a policy of denying, or which
effectively prevent, participation in
prayer in public schools by individuals on a constitutionally-protected
voluntary basis.
"Neither the United States nor
any state nor any local educational
agency shall require any person to
participate in prayer or influence
the form or content of any constitutionally protected prayer in such
public schools."
The vote came as the Senate debated lhe Goals 2000 education bill,
which would write into law the national education goals agreed to in
1989 by then-President Bush and the
nation's governors.
The Senate authorized $75 million
— $20 million of which already has
been appropriated — in grants to the
school districts most troubled by
high rates of crime and violence for
the current year, and $ 100 million for
fiscal 1995.
The House already has passed a
version of the education bill, which
would authorize spending $437 million, most of it in the form of federal
grants for states and districts involved in school reform.
Earlier yesterday, Educaiion Secretary Richard Riley said at a White
House briefing that "Goals 2000 is
the culmination ofa 10 year effort to
reform American education, to get
beyond the crisis of education thai
we've talked and talked about, to the
solution."
"We've got to get away from . . . a
tyranny of low expectations, believ-
ing that young people can get by
with just a minimum of learning,"
Mr. Riley said.
"That's really the essence of
Goals 2000," he said. "We have too
many young people coming out of
high school unprepared for the real
world."
The legislation also calls for retraining teachers and preparing new
kinds of tests.
"The uniqueness of this legislation is that it allows every state and
every community to fix the goals up
there like the North Star as a real
goal, and then voluntarily in their
own way design their system to meet
the goals," Mr. Riley said.
" I want to reiterate that the Goals
legislation encourages local reform,
but it does not mandate it."

�At birthday gala, Reagan slaps
'revisionist' view of his recorc
By Ralph Z. Hallow
THE WdSMINGTON TIMES
Ronald Reagan, once touted for
making America feel good about itself, boosted the spirits of fellow Repubbcans last night.
The Gipper and his longtime
friend Lady Margaret Thatcher regaled nearly 2,300 people gathered
for a GOP gala at the National Building Museum — fonnerly the Pension
Building — to celebrate his 83rd
birthday.
"Our friends m the other party
will never forgive us for our success
and are doing everything in their
power to rewrite history," said the
nation's 40th president.
"What we accomplished during
our years in the White House must
never be lost amid the rhetoric of
political revisionists," Mr. Reagan
said in a gently chiding manner.
"Listening to the liberals, you'd
think that the 1980s were the worst
period since the Great Depression
— filled with greed and despair," he
said. " I don't know about you, but I'm
getting awfully tired of the whining
voices in the White House these
days."
Said Michigan Gov. John Engler:
"It's vintage Reagan, his power to
paint a picture of how to change
America.
"What's interesting is we now have
the opportunity to take these words,
which are so consistent with Republican policy and to press the issue to
find the fault lines in the Congress,
because by no means are those
words accepted by the majority of
Democrats in Congress," he said.
"It was about ume," said David
Spencer, a private investor from Chicago who anended the $ 1,000-a-plate
gala. "His record has been disparaged for far too long. He has a record
that any president can be proud of ."
Mr. Reagan didn't mention him by
name, but President Clinton has
been a leading "revisionist" in Republican eyes for his comments; on
the Reagan era having "the worst
economic record in S years."
O
Mr. Reagan and Lady Thatcher,
former British prime minister, at
times beamed at each other. Last
night Mr. Reagan called her "one of
the giants of our century."
"In a time of average men, you
stood taller than anyone else," she
said of Mr. Reagan. "When others
spoke of compromise, you . . .
preached conviction."
Mr. Reagan did what many in the
audience said they had hoped he
would do: He addressed their contention that Mr. Clinton had stolen
the GOP's agenda and rhetoric on
crime and welfare.
"After watching the State of the
Union address the other night, I'm
reminded of the old adage that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery," Mr. Reagan said. "Only in this
case, it's not flattery, but grand larceny — the intellectual theft of ideas
that you and I recognize as our own.
"Speech delivery counts for little
on the world stage unless you have
convictions and, yes, the vision to see
beyond the front-row seats. The
Democrats may remember their
lines, but how quickly they forget
1
the lessons of the past," Mr Reagan
said.
He raised questions about Mr.
Clinton's competence to lead the nation's military forces against the
next foreign threat.
"1 have wimessed five major wars
in my lifetime, and I know how
swiftly storm clouds can gather on a
peaceful horizon," Mr Reagan said.
"The next time a Saddam Hussein
takes over Kuwait, or Nonh Korea
brandishes a nuclear weapon, will
we be ready to respond? .. Great
nations have responsibilities to lead,
and we should always be cautious of
those who would lower our profile
because they might just wind up
lowering our flag."
Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice
said, "The Democrats revision sure
wears, and his speech bnngs back to
me who he was as president, a man
who stood foursquare for conservative ideology and ... backed up
everything he said."
"In East Germany, he said. "Ifear
this wall down,' and they did. More
than any other human being, he was
instrumental in bringing about that
miracle," Mr. Fordice said
Last night's gala marked the first
time in 12 years the Republican National Comminee held an event of
such size and scope. When the Re
publicans held the White House, the
GOP Senate and House campaign
committees held the galas annually.
South Carolina Gov. Carroll A.
Campbell Jr., like Mr Engler. said he
particularly liked Mr Reagan s Une
about imitation bemg the sincerest
form of flattery.
Reagan: Country wants leadership
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
Excerpts from the advance text of
former President Reagan's speech
last night at the Republican National Committee's celebration of his
83rd birthday.
What we accompUshed during our
years in the White House must never
be lost amid the rhetonc of poUtical
revisionists.
When we came to Washington on
that bright sunny day in January of
1981, ... the reach of govemment
had become intolerable. It was a
time of rampant inflation and
crushing interest rates — when hope
was scarce. It was a time when cold,
ugly walls divided nations and human rights were trampled in the
r.tr.'.z c.l! ui* corrupt ideologies.
It was a time when the nuclear arms
race was spiraling out of control and
a blinding mistrust stood berween
East and West. We believed that for
the future of America and the free
world, this could not stand
So together we got the govemment off the backs of the American
people. We created milUons of new
jobs for Americans at aU income levels. We cut taxes and freed the people from the shackles of too much
govemment. And the economy burst
loose in the longest peacetime expansion ever. We brought America
back — bigger and better than ever.
It was a time when America was
a bright beacon of hope and freedom
to oppressed people everywhere
We rebuilt a demoralized, underfunded and unappreciated miUtary.
And we made it the most modem and
respected fbrce in the world. And
who can forget those so-caUed "experts" who said our miUtary buildup threatened a dangerous escalation of tensions? What kind of fool,
they asked, would caU the Soviet
Union an "evil empire"? But as
events have shown, there was nothing fooUsh in my prediction that
couu.iuidini-j was destined for the
ash-heap of history....
The world watched with amazement as we put our house in order
and took our rightful place as the
most dynamic country in the world.
And I firmly beUeve that history will
record our era as one of peace and
global prosperity. However, our task
is far from over. Our friends in the
other party will never forgive us for
our success and are doing everything in their power to rewrite his-
Oft Btagftoiflton HTuneg
tory. Listening to the liberals, you'd
thmk that the 1980s were the worst
period since the Great Depression
— fiUed with greed and despair.
Although the political landscape
has changed, the bold ideas of the
1980s are alive and well. RepubUcan
candidates swept every' major election across the country Last year....
After watching the State of the
Union address the other night, I'm
reminded of the old adage that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Only in this case, it's not flattery, but grand larceny — the
intellectual theft of ideas that you
and I recognize as our own. Speech
delivery counts for linle on the
world stage unless you have convictions and. yes. the vision to see beyond the front-row seats. .
In the end, it all comes down to
leadership. That is what this country
is looking for now. It was leadership
here at home that gave us strong
American influence abroad and the
collapse of imperial communism.
Great nations have responsibiUties
to lead, and we should always be cautious of those who would lower our
profUe because they might just wind
up lowering our flag.

Roundtable defeat
In its account of the Busmess
Roundtable's decision in favor of a
competing health care proposal despite White House efforts, the Wall
Street Journal says a White House
official said the vote was 46-14.
"That suggests that more than
two weeks of intensive White
House arm-twisting . . . failed to
sway even a single vote to the president's side," the Joumal repons.
The paper notes that "in telephone conference calls among
Roundtable members Jan. 13 and
14, the group's policy committee
had voted 45-14" for a nval bill by
Rep. Jim Cooper, Ttnnessee Democrat, and Sen. John B. Breaux, Louisiana Democrat.
The pain at home
Beverly Bassett Schaffer, Arkansas' top secunties regulator nine
years ago, watches children's shows
'. on television with her children to
"deal with the stress" of being a
leftover figure in WhitewaterMadison.
The Los Angeles Times reports:
"Schaffer is pan of the widening
circle of people from Bill Clinton's
past who find themselves increasingly on the spot as the White
House public relations machinery
moves to insulate the first family
from the controversy and shift attention to other issues.
"With the Clintons deciding not
to open their records on the affair
to the public or provide a detailed
public accounting of it, this group
in Arkansas — bankers who loaned
Clinton money, state officials who
had banking oversight, contributors
to Clinton's campaigns — are being •
pressed to fill in the vacuum with
what they know of what happened.
"For some, like Schaffer, the
frustration of this position is growing....
"She says she judged the Madison proposal strictly on its merits
and wonders why the Clintons have
not come forward to help stand up
for her, or why Mrs. Clinton herself
has not been more forthcoming
about her own role.
" T don't know why she hasn't
been more open,' Schaffer says. In
the end, she said, 'the people left
behind in Arkansas are bearing the
brunt of this.'"
The Farrakhan flap
The Baltimore Sun offers this
background on the imphcations for
Rep. Kweisi Mfume, head of the
Congressional Black Caucus, of the
controversy over a hate speech by
an aide to Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan:
Mr. Mfume, representative of a
largely black Baltimore district
and a man of "lofty ambition," announced a "sacred covenant" last
year between the caucus and the
Nation of Islam.
Ronald Walters, a Howard University political scientist, told Baltimore Sun reporter Susan Baer
that the "politics of repudiation"
are very difficult in Lhe black community because of its stmcture.
The Sun reports that the Nation
of Islam is an "extremely active
and positive force" in Mr. Mfume's
district, which includes most of
Baltimore's black neighborhoods
and is "ravaged by crime and
drugs and unemployment."
"People in our community look
upon the Nation of Islam more favorably than people realize," says
Rodney Orange, president of the
Baltimore chapter of the NAACR
and the Sun adds that the Nation of
Islam's message of self-respect and
nationalism "resonates with underprivileged communities."
GOP women running
Mr. Mfume, under pressure for a
quick distancing from Mr. Farrakhan, on Wednesday said the episode "severely jeopardized" ties
with the caucus and denounced the
aide's language as intolerable "garbage."
Ted's take Is tops
While 16 Senate incumbents up
fbr re-election raised at least Sl
million each last year, none surpassed Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as
he prepared to renew his 32-year
career in the chamber.
Massachusetts' most enduring
politician raised $3.7 million and
entered 1994 with more than $2.5
million of that in the bank, according to RoU CaU's analysis of Federal
Election Commission reports.
Mr. Kennedy's RepubUcan opposition appears badly divided. Seeking the nomination to oooose him
are talk show host Janet Jeghelian,
businessman John Lakian and Min
Romney, son of former Michigan
Gov. George Romney.

"We talked about the presumption of innocence that our system is

Unwanted relief
In Califomia, hundreds of Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) checks, for up to
$3,450 each, have been mailed to
people Uving in areas hit by the
earthquake even though some of
the recipients did not ask for assistance, the Los Angeles Times reports.
When some called FEMA, they
were told the money could be used
for earthquake-related costs. The
checks came with a warning, however, that persons cashing them are
subject to audits and should keep
detailed records.
FEMA officials concede there
are problems that stem from an effort to get aid to victims as quickly
as possible. They add that only a
smaU number are unhappy atwut
receving the 21,000 checks, totalling some $67 milUon.
It never ends
After protests by local AIDS activists, former President Bush and
his wife, Barbara, resigned from
the honorary host comminee of a
planned Houston fund-raiser for
AIDS research. Bush spokeswoman
Rose Zamana said, "It was more
out of courtesy so that they would
not harm the fund-raising effort."
Today's quote
Columnist WUUam Safire in the
New York Times: "Robert Fiske is
the one Janet Reno was forced by
[Associate Anomey General Webster] Hubbell and White House
Counsel Bernard Nussbaum to
choose as 'special' tnonindependent) couniel in the Whitewater
and Vincent Foster investigations.
Why choose the Uberal Fiske,
known to be anathema to conservarves?
"Because (outgoing Deputy Attorney General PhiUp] Heymann
wanted someone else — Donald
Ayre — who insisted that no
lawyer-client privUege be taken by
Counsel Nussbaum and the Clintons. But the maUeable Mr. Fiske
made no such demands, which is
why the [General Services Administration] has just signed a threeyear lease for Fiske's headquarters
in Linle Rock."
Heroes of the bench
A judge who once asked a male
anomey to take off his jacket and
then invited a female lawyer to
"take off anything you want" has
been named one of "America's Most
Sexist Judges" by Redbook magazine.
Judge Robert P Horgos of AUegheny County, Pa., said he immediately apologized to the woman after
making the comment in his chambers. Other judges who made the
Ust in Redbook this month:
• Thomas BoUmger of Baltimore
County, who granted probation to a
man convicted of raping a drunken
woman. He said an unconscious
woman on a bed was "the dream of
a lot of males, quite honestly." The
judge said he was misinterpreted;
he later agreed to take a rapesensitivity course.
• Gail Craytor of Idabel, Okla.,
who released a man from jaU after
only three months because he did
not use a p m against his spouse.
He liaa beafeifWr to death.
• WiUiam E. Schadler of Jonestown, Pa., dismissed speeding
charges against a fashion model
who said she was being chased by
four men. Judge Schadler said he
would have doubted her if she had
been "an ugly broad."

�Paretariesobu assauts
b congressional budget axes
y
By Greg Pierce
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
The director of the Office of Management and Budget said yesterday
that the administration's fiscal 1995
budget will contain three-quarters
of the cost savings sought by congressional deficit hawks.
Leon Panetta, speaking before a
Senate committee, referred to a
Mouse amendment oifered by Rep.
Timothy J. Penny, Minnesota Democrat, and Rep. John R. Kasich, Ohio
Republican, which the administration and House Democratic leaders
defeated.
" I thank you for that news," said
Sen. Joseph I . Lieberman, Connecticut Democrat and member of
the Senate Govemmental AfTairs
Committee.
Mr. Panetta said all the cuts in his
budget are not the same as those in
the Penny-Kasich amendment, but
Medicare and Medicaid savings contained in that legislation are in the
president's health care bill.
The budget, set to be released
Monday, would eliminate 100 pro
grams and cut or freeze 600 others,
Mr. Panetta said.
Seven out of 14 Cabinet depart
ments will have less to spend than in
1994. he said, and more than 100,000
federal positions will be cut, "so
Ihere will be some very tough decisions here."
The budget is "very tough" on discretionary spending, Mr. Panetta
said, "largely because we have to
abide by a hard freeze" that does not
even allow for inflation.
Mr. Panetta said the budget also
will include further recissions — reductions in already appropriated
funds — as well as money for the
crime bill.
The Senate has passed a crime bill
that would use savings from federal
personnel cutbacks to finance new
prisons and put 100,000 more police
on the nation's streets. The House is
still working on its crime bill.
Welfare reform is not included in
the budget, Mr. Panetta said, because the administration is still formulating its policy.
Mr. Panetta also hailed news that
the Congressional Budget Office
thinks the 1995 budget deficit will be
about $170 billion, down from $255
bilhon in fiscal 1993.
"We've shown that with a little
courage and leadership, we can get
it done," Mr Panetta said, attributing
the deficit drop to Mr. Clinton's 1994
budget.
The OMB director and Mr. Lieberman expressed frustration over an
apparent technicality endangering
the administration's preferred
method of cutting the federal work
force by 252,000 — voluntary buyouts.
The Congressional Budget Office
has ruled that the buyouts — estimated to cost $519 million — are an
up-front cost that under pay-as-yougo mles will require new taxes or
corresponding cuts elsewhere in the
budget.
"We're going to pay for the buyout," Mr. Panetta said, although he
regretted the ruling. The administration is now negotiating with
House budget leaders on how to
come up with the money, he said.
"The result is ridiculous," Mr.
Lieberman said, adding, "We've got
to figure out a way" to get out from
under "the green eyeshades."
Sen. John Glenn, Ohio Democrat
and committee chairman, said " I
think you're going to have a pretiy
big sales job" in convincing average
people that buyouts are necessary.
Mr. Panetta said he can't wait
much longer for Congress to approve the buyouts. He said some
agencies may have to begin layoffs
without them. Such layoffs would be

based on seniority, where one employee could "bump" a junior colleague.
Layoffs would be "a lousy way" to
shrink the government, Mr. Panetta
said, calling it "a crazy process."

Plundering banks in
'the Lawless State'
lb hear Bill Clinton and his friends tell it, Arkansas is not so much the Natural State as "the Lawless
State."
The president's defenders, trying to put the best
face on the growing mystery called Whitewater,
shrug and say that, well, plundering banks and
shaking down farmers and merchants in a poor
state is not what nice people do, but the Clintonoids
are only doing what people have always done down
there.
It's true that Arkansas has always been a robust
place, a land of wondrous beasties and magic huckleberries, where the frontier spirit lives in the belief that a man is entitled to do just about anything
he's big enough to do, and, in all fairness to the
president, the randy and voracious razorback boar
was widely venerated for a long time before he arrived at the place called Hope.
And in Arkansas lore, governors have always
been cut a little slack, such as the governor in the
'30s who wrote fire and theft insurance on every
concrete and steel bridge in the state highway system, and the governor in the '50s who, about to be
indicted for stealing money from the state highway
fund, got his chief of staff to arrange to replace a
certain judge with the town drunk, who then dismissed the grand jury that was about to indict the
governor.
White water, as all water will, seeps and drips.
Sen. David Pryor, the president's gofer in the U.S.
Senate, seems as bewildered as the rest of the
Democrats. The Republicans, he complained to his
hometown paper the other day, "keep raising the
ante." First they wanted a special counsel; now they
want a congressional investigation. Mr. Pryor is unhappy, like most of the congressional Democrats,
because "Whitewater" is suddenly seeping into public consciousness faster than they can bail. Drip,
dnp, drip.
If Vince Foster actually killed himself, as the ace
of detectives of the Park
Police insists, maybe it
was because he was
aware, as the rest of us
are not, of the size of the
mighty wall of white
water about to descend on
himself and his friends in
the White House. Why else
would a man at the top of
his career, in perfect
health with a beautiful
wife and teen-age children, do it? What did he
know, and when did he
know it? And who else is
The Bard
going to find out?
A month ago, everyone flinched from using the
I-word. Impeaching another president was too awful to even think about. Now some people, having
finally looked at the violent death of Mr. Foster with
unblinkered eyes, are mumbling the M-word. Murder, as the Bard said, is an organ with many
mouths.
Who knows who might have done Li /ince Foster? An itinerant junkie, looking for a few dollars to
buy a fix? An embinered client? Someone with a
grudge against the lawyers of the Rose Law Firm,
who seem greedy even for lawyers?
The more we know about this sordid story, the
i more sordid it looks. Bill Sessions, a native Arkansan who was booted out as director of the FBI the
day before Mr. Foster died, says Mr. Foster was part
of a cabal within the Justice Department struggling
for control of the FBI. Now stories abound, both
here and in Little Rock, that Webb HubbeU, who as
assistant attorney general signs his leners "chief
operating officer," has not only not recused himself
from the Whitewater inquiry but is actually trying
to manipulate the investigation to protect the Clintons.
House Speaker Tbm Foley, trying desperately to
hold back the wall of white water, argues lamely
that hearings are not necessary because no one has
presented evidence of wrongdoing. Precisely. Mr
Speaker. You collect evidence first. Then, if you find
the evidence, you bring charges. (Your lawyer could
explain it to you.)
The president no doubt wants to get to the bottom
of this more than anyone; Mr. Foster, after all, is
said to have been Hillary's best friend. Even at this
late date, he could assign the FBI to do what neither
a ranger of the Park Police (or even a meter maid)
could do as well as the agents of the best investigative force in the world.
Until he does that, and invites Congress to set
loose its own investigators, the thunderclouds of
suspicion now building over the White House will
soon render his administration moribund. Impotent,
even. Arkansas is God's own heaven, as all know,
and its good name will survive even Bill Clmton, but
there may be more things going on here than even
heaven dreams of.

Bad examples do just the opposite. What effect do you think the

likely to have on a youngster teetering beside the precipice of temptation? They are creating a moral
atmosphere that gives comfort to
the "If it feels good, do it" mentality, offering condoms, training m sex
techniques and drug legalization to
foster the illusion that government
can clean up the consequences of
irresponsible behavior.
We live in times when just about
every domestic problem we face is,
at its root, a problem of moral character. Yet despite Bill Clintons' occasional manipulation of the rhetoric
of "values" for political purposes,
his administration steers a mistaken course between warmed-over
techno-psycho-babble and barely
repressed enthusiasm for moral
degeneracy and self-indulgence.
Given this policy direction, the
resumption of a rise in drug abuse

North Carolina sentenced him to a

These three cases demonstrate

Mr. Woonon reports statistics

rapists are out in three. For robbery and assault, the typical sentences are six and four years, but

�What Mr. Clinton's advisers really think about trade deficits
By David Dickson
rT"\he Clinton administration's policy to reduce the US trade
deficit by pressuring Japan and
• other trading partners to open their
markets to US. goods and services is
doomed to failure, according to many
economists, both liberals and conservatives.
As trade tensions between Japan
and the U.S. intensify, the Clinton
administration has rejected the
advice of several of the Democratic
Party's most prominent economists,
including the former chairman of the
Jimmy Carter's Council of Economic
Advisers (CEA) and two members of
CUnton's own CEA.
The administration has focused on
the trade barriers of its partners as
the primary cause of the trade deficit.
Most economists, however, have
traced the source of the trade deficit
to the insufficiency of U.S. private
saving to finance both investment and
the government's budget deficit.
Indeed, few economic issues seem
to elicit a higher degree of consensus
among mainstream economists. The
agreement stems more from the laws
of addition and subtraction than from
the interpretation of economic theory
Charles Schultze, chairman of Mr
T
David Dickson is a research librarian at The Washington Times.
Carter's CEA and budget director in
the Johnson administration, summarized the argument in his 1992 book,
"Memos to the President." "It's not a
country's trade policies or that of its
competitors that principally determine whether it has a trade deficit,
but the relationship between its
national saving and the investment
demands of its homeowners and business firms."
Using the universally accepted
techniques of national income
accounting, economists have established a simple arithmetic relationship among private saving, investment, the government's budget deficit
and a country's foreign-trade balance. Tbtal private (personal and
business) saving must equal the sum
of private investment, the government's budget deficit, and the foreign-trade balance.
According to Rudiger Dombusch,
an economic adviser to the CUnton
campaign, the private sector has
three ways of disposing of its saving.
It can lend funds to business firms; it
can make loans to the government to
finance its budget deficit; or it can
lend to foreigners to finance a U.S.
trade surplus.
Indeed, for much ofthe post-World
War II era, the U.S. had sufficient private saving tofinancebusiness investment, relatively small government
deficits, and trade surpluses.
Matters changed markedly in the
early 1980s, when the budget deficit
increased significantly Private saving
did not increase as much Fortunately, business investment, the seed corn
for economic growth, did not fall.
"Accordingly, as a matter of arithmetic," Mr. Dornbusch observes, "the
United States had to be importing
more than it was exporting," thus generating a current-account trade
deficit.
Because business investment and
Indeed, Mr. Blinder
views the trade deficit

natural and necessary
phenomenon.
the budget deficit together exceeded
total private saving throughout the
1980s, the United States hadtoborrow
from abroad. The direct consequence
of borrowing from foreigners has
been a slew of annual foreign-trade
deficits.
Charles Wolf Jr., dean ofthe RAND
graduate school and director of economic research in RAND's National
Defense Research Institute, agrees.
Writing this summer in The Wall
Street Journal, Mr. Wolf argued, "The
saving vs. investment deficit depends
on US macroeconomic policies —
specifically on U.S. fiscal and monetary policies. Diminishing the current-account [trade] deficit depends
on real change here that turns U.S. citizens and their government into better savers. It does not depend on
attacking the vestiges of Japanese
mercantilism reflected in its protective trade policies."
This fall, three dozen American
economists and poUtical scientists,
including four Nobel laureates in economics, echoed this analysis in a letter highly critical of the administration's trade policies with Japan.
During recent U.S.-Japanese trade
negotiations, Japan's international
trade vice minister, Sozaburo Okamatsu, attributed America's trade
deficit to the "U.S. budget deficit and
imbalance between spending and saving." Not only did the Clinton administration formally and categorically
reject this proposition. It also disparaged the credentials of any economist
who subscribed to such a notion.
Yet two of the three members of
Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic
Advisers have written textbooks using
the same arguments of Messrs.
Schultze, Dornbusch, Wolf, and the
four Nobel letter writers.
In the 1993 edition of his economics textbook, Joseph Stiglitz makes
these points:
• "The saving-investment identity
says that if there is an increase in the
[budget] deficit and if private saving
and investment are unchanged, capital flows from abroad must increase.
In a world of international trade, the
fiscal [budget] deficit is a problem
because unless saving increases commensurately or private investment
decreases commensurately, it leads
to a trade deficit and foreign borrowing."
• " I f it proves impossible to red.ice
America's borrowing [from abroad],
since those funds are needec to
finance the budget deficit, ther, it
immediately follows . . . that no measures for promoting exports or rec .cing imports will be successful in
reducing the trade deficit. If cap ial
flows cannot be changed, then fie
trade deficit cannot be changed.
Attempts to deal with the goods side
of international trade while ignoring
the capital side are likely to have 'ittie efTect in reducing the trade defi cit;
what they will do is interfere with Lhe
efficiency of the economy."
• "Tb decrease the capital fltws
[and the trade deficit], it is necesstry
either to reduce the budget deficit, to
increase private saving, or to
decrease private investment in
machines and equipment by U.S.
firms. The only practical way to
decrease capitalflowsand reduce the
trade deficit is to reduce the government's budget deficit."
Alan Blinder, also a member of
Clinton's CEA, concurs with Mr.
Stiglitz. As the budget deficit
increased in the 1980s, Mr. Blinder
Cljc Jftwfjingtoii Sfimeo FRIDAY. FEBRUARY 4. IM
argues in a textbook he co-authored
with WiUiam Baumol, "The United
States could have avoided a large
trade deficit only by saving much
more or investing much less."
Because saving did not rise and
investment did not faU, "only one possibility" remained. "The government
budget deficit led to a massive trade
deficit."
Because "budget deficits and trade
deficits are linked," Mr. BUnder says,
"the U.S. trade deficit must be cured
by some combination of lower budget
deficits, higher saving, and lower
investment."
On the issue of Japanese protectionism, Mr. Blinder is quite blunt:
"No one really thinks that, even in a
completely free market, we could seU
in Japan nearly as much as they sell
here." Indeed, he views the trade
deficit with Japan as a natural and
necessary phenomenon. "While the
American people and government
together are big net borrowers, the
Japanese people and government are
together big net savers. In an integrated world financial system, it is
therefore natural that the Japanese
should be lending to us" by running
a trade surplus with the United
States.
Rejecting all of the above and blasting the aforementioned letter writers,
a senior CUnton administration official declared recently, "Anybody who
signed that letter should have his
Nobel Prize taken away."
�Sor ie c es o is we o gf o be asking a )out health care
By Merrill Matthews Jr.
and Morgan O. Reynolds
P
resident Clinton says that the
only element of his proposed
health care reform that is nonnegotiable is universal coverage.
Ironically, that is the goal that is
least likely to be achieved if his
package is passed, since guaranteeing universal insurance coverage is
virtually impossible. The reason is
that any system of health insurance
must be administered, and it
requires people to be both stable
and responsible. But in any society
there is always a percentage of the
population that is transient and irresponsible. We already provide
health care for these individuals at
public hospitals across the country,
but requiring everyone to buy
health insurance would be an
administrative nightmare.
Unfortunately, a number of Republicans, most notably Sen. John Chafee,
have adopted the same goal as Mr.
Chnton; only their methods vary. Mr.
Clinton would place the obligation of
paying for health insurance primarily on employers, while Mr. Chafee
would place that burden on individuuls. Neither has much stomach for

research institute based in Dallas
Morgan O. Reynolds is a Senior FeUow

explaining what they would do to punish those who show up at the emergency room door with no health insurance.
So before he attempts to revamp
the whole American health care system in pursuit of an impossible
dream, Mr. Clinton ought to ask himself five fundamental questions.
• Who are the uninsured? They are
mostly young, healthy people —two
out of three uninsured adults are
under the age of 40. Many work in
lower-paying, service-oriented jobs
(e.g., restaurants) that do not typically provide health insurance. Approximately half of the 38 miUion uninsured are uninsured for four months
or less, often due to job transition
(they left a job last month and just got
hired, so that their insurance will kick
in in another month or two). Only
about 15 percent of them are uninsured for two years or more. They
tend to be younger and lower-income
individuals, though a portion are
medically uninsurable.
But not aU of the uninsured are
low-income. About 3.8 milUon ofthe
uninsured live in households with
annual incomes of $50,000 or more.
Furthermore, 3.5 milUon have a bachelor's degree, and 100,000 have a doctorate. About 2.7 million of the uninsured are self-employed. They choose
to be uninsured partly because health
insurance is expensive and they do
not get the same tax break as those
who get health insurance through
their employer.
In addition, the uninsured populations are concentrated in certain geographical areas. Fbr example, most
Southern border states have uninsured populations of 20 percent or
more, while many Northern states,
such as Michigan, Wisconsin, North
Dakota and Iowa, have only 10 percent or less.
Employees of larger firms can
retain their health insurance when
they change jobs but often do not do
so, simply because they want to
spend their own money for other
things. If they are healthy and know
they will be covered soon under a
new employer, many choose to take
their chances.
• Is universal coverage attainable?
The evidence is overwhelming, and
the answer is, no. We have a long history in this country of trying to force
aU people into behaving the way the
government wants them to behave,
with rather dismal results.
Fbr example, at least 41 states and
the District of Columbia require
motoriststocarry auto liabiUty insurance. However, about one in seven
drivers remains uninsured (ironically, about the same number who lack
health insurance, where there is no
mandate).
As another example, Hawaii has a
20-year experience with employer
mandates that require employers to
pay at least 50 percent of their
employees' health insurance, yet
many Hawaiians remained uninsured
(the exact percentage remains in dispute, but the 1991 Hawaii State Data
indicates about 6 percent uninsured).
Even Canada's much vaunted
health care system has not achieved
universal coverage, since an estimated 2 percent to 5 percent of the
population of British Columbia —
about 50.000 to 100,000 people — fail
to pay premiums and thus are unin
sured
One of the primary reasons universal coverage is unattainable is that
there are many people who are only
marginaUy in the system. People who
sell drugs, operate on the black market, prostitutes, the transient and the
homeless (i.e. "the addressless") are
virtually impossible to cover under
any type of health insurance plan. In
order to administer insurance, people
have to want to be part of the system
and they have to have a place where
they can be contacted. Many people,
however, choose to live at the edge of
the system and refuse to function
within the society.
Moreover, the CUnton plan has no
effective way of monitoring the uninsured. Approximately 75 percent of
those who become uninsured are covered again within a year. The administration has no provision to identify
these individuals and require them to
be reinsured immediately.
Is universal coverage necessary?
Not only is universal coverage unattainable, it is unnecessary. Why?
Because there is a fundamental difference between universal coverage
and universal access. We already
have universal access, since the poor
can enter a pubUc hospital, one that
is supported by tax dollars to provide
health care for those who cannot
afford it, and receive needed treatment,regardlessof the abUity to pay.
For example. Parkland Memorial
Hospital, which is the pubUc hospital
for Dallas County, served about
IIIIC0
800,000 patients in its out-patient <:linic in 1993, with 62 percent of that care
being uncompensated Anyone in this
country can get care, even without
money or insurance. They may have
to wait in Une, and it may not be the
most efficient or cost-effective system, but everybody has access to
health care.
• Is universal coverage desirable?
If it's voluntary. But the federal government has no constitutional authority to coerce people into purchasing
health insurance. We do not force
people to purchase fbod or food insurance, nor do we fbrce grocers or farmers to give food to a hungry person at
government-dictated prices. We do
not force people to obtain housing,
clothing or a wide range of other
necessities. Yet people aren't dropping in the streets form starvation
because individuals fUl that need voluntarily. And food, water and housing
are more basic human needs than
health insurance.
An element of the Health Security Act that the administration is
reluctant to disclose is its requirement that those who don't pay their
premiums will be fined $5,000' or
three times the extent of their liability, whichever is greater (Sec. 134S).
What if a family believes it can't
afford those premiums? If the administration agrees, the family may get
some financial assistance. But iif the
administration disagrees, the family
could be prosecuted to the fullest
extent of the law.
Fbrcing people to purchase health
insurance would be harmful to the
functioning of a free society. Frt e-

dom depends on people taking personal responsibility for their lives,
their actions and their health. The
more the state shoulders those
responsibilities, the less people see
themselves as responsible individuals who must make decisions and be
accountable.
For example, Social Security
came in 1935 as a supplemental
income program for the elderly.
Tbday, many lower- and middleincome people, who in the past
would have made a conscious effort
to set aside a "nest egg" for the
future, now look at Social Security as
their primary source of future
income. They have, in essence,
ceded the responsibility for providing tor their future to the federal
government. As a result, personal
savings have decreased, knowledge
about investing has diminished, and
dependence on the state has
increased.
• I f not universal coverage, what
should be the goal? A level playing
field that encourages health insurance coverage. Public policy can
achieve this goal in four ways: by
adopting economic policies that
increase jobs and wages, since most
people get their health insurance at
their workplace; by creating tax fairness so that everyone who purchases health insurance gets the same
tax break; by eliminating state
health insurance mandates that
raise the cost of health insurance;
and by encouraging the private safety net that catches those who cannot
afford health insurance or health
care.

•
In the piece, Mr Tklbott has cast a
jaundiced eye at US -Israeli relations.
The "sad fact is that Israel is well on
its way to becoming not just a dubious
asset but outright liability to American security interests, both in the
Middle East and worldwide."
Israel's bombing of Beirut and the
Iraqi nuclear weapons plant were, in
Mr. Talbott's view, an embarrassment
to the United States. Mr. Tblbott suggested cutting military aid if Israel
didn't change its ways. "If Israel continues to take international law into its
own hands as violently — and as
embarrassingly to the U S — as it did
in Baghdad and Beirut, the next display of U S displeasure ought to be
more sustained and less symbolic. It
might include selective cutbacks in
military aid, which is $ 1.2 billion for
fiscal 1981 alone. Some of that aid is
not critical to Israel's defense. In fact,
it amounts to a subsidy to the Israeli
defense industry, which in turn sometimes competes with the U.S. on world
markets."
What else should the United
States do? How about a little meddling in Israeli politics. "It is high
time for the U.S. to engage Israel in
a debate over the fundamental
nature of their relationship. I f that
means interfering in Israeli internal
politics, then so be it."
Mr. Ttil bott sounded the meddling
theme again in another piece pubhshed in 1990, "Why Israel Should
Thank Bush." Hailing President
Bush's stated opposition to Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, Mr. TUbott urged both the American government and American Jews to seek
reform in Israel. "From now on, the
U.S. government should encourage
not just diplomacy between Israel
and its Arab neighbors, but political
reform within Israel as well. So
should the American Jewish community — including the one in Brooklyn."
Now it's Mr. Tfelbott's chance to
determine U.S. government policy.
That's a scary prospect. A survey Of
Mr. Talbott's Time articles was
released by the Zionist Organization
of America at a Jan. 31 conference in
Washington. There, ZOA president
Morton Klein was joined by New Jersey Congressman Jim Saxton, who
announced his opposition to Mr. Ihlbott. The National Jewish Coalition, a
Jewish Republican group, has called
on Mr. Clinton to withdraw Mr. Tklbott's nomination.
This should not, however, be a partisan issue. If Mr. Clinton is serious

lack anti-Semitism — though
it erupts soregularlyas to be
somewhat expected — is still
jolting and disgusting. Just as
bad, toofewmainline black groups
denounce this religious and racial
hatred, and those doing so speak way
too softly.
Louis Farrakhan is at the epicenter
of the storm, spewing much of the
hatred himself and encouraging gobs
more. Recently it was a Farrakhan
aide who called Jews "bloodsuckers
of the black community," doing so in
an address at an institution of higher
education, Kean CoUege in New Jersey.
Perhaps to show he wasn't only
anti-Semitic, this aide, who was billed
as "national spokesmanforLouis Farrakhan," Khalid Muhammad, also
called the pope a "cracker." He went
on to advocate that all South African
white people be slaughtered —
women and children included.
As usual, Mr. Parrakhan and his
Nation of Islam group bobbed and
weaved about such sentiments. [At a
press conference yesterday, Mr. Farrakhan disassociated himself from
the speech and announced Mr.
Muhammad's dismissal as an aide,
but went on to launch a new attack on
the Anti-Defamation League.]
And, as usual, mainline black
groups muttered something about
what an awful shame it was, espedally since the Congressional Black
Caucus had entered into a "sacred
covenant" with the Nation of Islam to
work on black self-help and local
empowerment projects.
There comes a time when a
"covenant" becomes less "sacred"
when it includes haters.
Leaving aside the question of how
proper is a Congressional Black Caucus — imagine the outcry over anyone
forming a "Congressional White Caucus" —the Caucus bas mostly been a
responsible group.
mie, the Black Caucus charged
way out of the mainstream after President Reagan ordered US. Marines
into Grenada in 1986. Its vehement
opposition resulted in an odd situation
wherein black leaders in America
were pitted against black leaders in
the Caribbean—and just about every
black citizen of Grenada itself.
Nonetheless, the Congressional
Black Caucus has since worked
toward worthy, albeit far liberal,
goals. Its bead. Rep. Kweisi Mfume of
Maryland, is afinespokesman and, to
his credit did wnte Mr. Farrakhan
askingforan explanation.

Reports that a bullet was tired into

only two possibilities were suicide or
murder.
As late as two days after his death
Dean St. Dennis, a spokesman for the
Justice Department, said they were
"looking carefuUy at the possibility, a
slim possibility, that he was murdered."
But the murder of a White House
senior adviser is monstrous to even
contemplate. As the horror of that
possibility began to sink in, most people, quite understandably, shied away
from it.
Facts and clues that did not point
toward suicide were shunted aside.
Questions that should have been

reform plan with name-calling
He says the critics are liars who
are only interested in making profits
on people's illnesses He dismisses
factual statements about the plan,
including direct quotes from the plan
itself, as "scare taclics."
Little wonder Mr. Magaziner
prefers name-calling. Numerous critics of all persuasions have pointed out
many disturbing features of the plan
—forexample, the many limitations
on the patient's ability to control treatment, the strict rationing of medical
specialists, and criminal penalties for
resorting to bribes in order to get
care. Obviously, the plan is deeply
flawed when its own sponsors are convinced that it will force people to
resort to bribes.
The Clinton health plan was developed secretly, and the Clintons are
still resisting making the Health Tfcsk
Fbrce documents public. This is highly unusual. Normally, health legislation is crafted through congressional
hearings open to all affected by it. The
Clintons and their staffs do not want
those affected by the legislation to
have any input into it.

This may not prove murder Such
circumstances could have resulted

But questions concerning Mr. Fbster's death do remain in the minds of
some. The revolver that supposedly
kiUed him was a 1913 Colt, a coUector's item. How did Mr. Fbster get the
gun? Was it his?

not the case.

West Wing of the White House was
checked out by White House aides,
George Gonzalez was thefirstrescue worker to
reach Mr. Foster's body and he recalled that some
things were "strange."
Ruddy, a New York Post reporter, has
interviewed the men who handled
Mr. Fbster's body.
George Gonzalez was theftrstrescue worker to reach Mr. Fbster's body
and he recalled that some things were

"The face was white and pale, and
only a thin trickle of blood oozed from
one corner of his mouth," Mr. Gonzalez said. "UsuaUy a suicide by gunshot is a mess."
Kory Ashford, who helped place
Mr. Fbster's remains in a body bag,
said he did not remember seeing any
blood, adding, " I can't even recall an
exit wound."
And Kevin Fomshill, the first
police offlcer on the death scene,
recalls that everything, including Vincent Fbster's wliite shirt, "was really

Thrusting trust into
the health debate
That in itself is suspicious, as are
the scare tactics that the CUntons are
using to seU their plan. The plan has
two foundations — both rotten. One is
the claim that America has " ahealth
care crisis." The other is that there
are 58 milUon Americans without
health care.
The Clintons pretend that only
Republicans and profiteering insurance companies, pharmaceutical
companies, and medical specialists
are opposed to their plan. This is not
true. It is New York's Democratic Sen.
Pat Moynihan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who said
there is no health care crisis. It is
moderate Democrats, such as Sen.
Sam Nunn of Georgia, who say they
are unwilling to make a riverboat
gamble on our medical system.
The RepubUcans, for the most part,
are too fearful to be an opposition
party, and they favor Mr. CUnton's
plan or their own copy of it. The most
trenchant critics of the plan have
been Democrats and outside experts,
such as Alan Enthoven of Stanford
University.
All of this s'c. ?gests that if anyone is
lying, it is the Clintons and their staffs.
It fits the Clinton pattern. Just as the
CUntons won't clear their name by
releasing the Whitewater documents,
they won't reUeve doubts about their
health plan by releasing the task force
documents. The Clintons won't even
release the police report or autopsy
on Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Raster's purported suicide.
Something is wrong when the editor of the Wall Street Journal has to
file a Freedom of Information Act
request to get a copy of a suicide
report and still cannot get a copy five
months later.
Something is wrong when the paramedic, ambulance driver and technician who picked up Vincent Fbster's
body say how peculiar it was tofinda
suicide's body neatly lying on the
ground "as if it was ready for the coffin," with the .38revolverfirmlyin his
hand and no sign of blood or the usual
mess associated with gunshots to the
head.
Many experts have expressed bafflement. Says one: "A .38 makes a
powerful explosion. There's a backwash of blood and tissue." Says
another: "NormaUy, when a person
commits suicide, the gun doesn't end
up in their hand. If the individual is
gripping the gun, that would lead to
thinking that possibly someone put
the gun in his hand." Normally, the
recoU ofa powerful weapon like a .38
takes the weapon out of the suicide's
hands, and the gun ends up 10 or
more feet away.
Something is wrong when Mr. Clinton's statements about his Whitewater
partnership are contradicted by his
business parmer, James McDougal,
and others involved in the venture.
It was the Clintons who took the
Whitewater files from Vincent Fbster's offlce, which should have been
sealed, and Ued about it pubUcly for
six months. Only under mounting
pressure did they admit they had
taken thefilesand given them to Mr.
CUnton's lawyer, a criminal defense
attorney.
The CUntons have made it clear
that they don't want a pubhc debate on
their business dealings or their health
care plan. Why?
Pundit Sally Quinn, who worships
Mr. CUnton's pohcies, says the Clintons' behavior has raised questions
about their trustworthiness. Time
magazine (Jan. 24) says we face "the
much larger issue of whether a president and first lady can be trusted to
obey the law and teU the truth."

Education bill lets localities tailor their own reforms
For the past year, I have crisscrossed the nation on behalf of school
reform. At every stop, I have reaffirmed the Clinton administration's
strong commitment to the traditional
American principle of local control of
education. That's why I feel compelled to respond to Sen. Judd Gregg's
misguided Jan. 31 Op-Ed article
about the administration's Goals 2000
school reform bill, "A federal grab for
control of schools.
Goals 2000 is based upon a bipartisan consensus of what we need to do
to improve education in America. It
was developed by a broad coalition of
educators, business and community
leaders, parents' groups and policymakers from around the nation.
Among the groups that have endorsed
the bill that will be voted on by the
Senate today is the National Governors' Association (NGA). The NGA's
endorsement alone ought to convince
Mr. Gregg that he's got it wrong about
Goals 2000 — or does he believe that
the governors, both Republican and
Democratic, want to see a "federal
grab" of their schools?
Mr. Gregg declares that the bill
would create "two small, but extremely powerful federal entities . . . that
will define how education should be
delivered on Main Street anywhere in
America." Not true. The charge
ignores the fact that the standards
certified by the National Education
Standards and Improvement Council
(NESIC) and the National Education
Goals Panel will be voluntary national standards. States and localities will
continue to have the same control
they now have over what happens in
their schools —teaching practices,
tests, curriculum, instructional matenals, class size, course offerings and
all the other elements of education.
NESIC wil] have absolutely no authority over these matters.
As for the National Education
Goals Panel, the overwhelming
majority of its members are state officials. These include governors and,
upon enactment of the bill, state legislators. This will provide an extra
measure of assurance that any national standards — even voluntary' standards — are acceptable to the states.
Mr. Gregg also need not worry that
"in order to qualify for access to a
S400 million pot of funds, states
[would be required to] produce plans
that conform to the content and performance standards set out by the
national panels." Again, that's not
true. There is explicit language in
both the Senate and the House versior - of the bill that declares that
•
states are not required to use certified
standards in order toreceivefunds
under the aa or any other federal
education program, including Chapter 1. "Voluntary" really does mean
voluntary.
Finally, Goals 2000 won't centralize
authority in Washington, it will
reduce federal intrusion It provides
the secretary of education with
authority to waive federal regulations
that impede local refonn efforts. The
bill also makes it possible for states
and localities to integrate other federal assistance with their reform
plans so that federal programs support rather than thwan local efforts.
Fbr all these reasons, Goals 2000
passed the House of Representatives
with strong bipartisan support, and
we are optimistic that the vote in the
Senate, expected today, will produce
the same kind of result.
Goals 2000 is guided by the sure
knowledge that genuine school
reform must truly be a grass-roots
movement. The federal government
can provide guidance and resources,
but that's where its involvement
ought to end. Reform won't happen in
Washington. It will happen va the
classroom.

Terrorism and the Soviets: The truth outs

lowly but surely the Kremlin tombs are yielding up their secrets, and so are the little Kremlins that sprouted all over Eastern Europe during the days of Soviet hegemony. One secret just
recently yielded up is the fact that the communist
regime in Bulgaria provided arms andfinancingfor
other communist regimes and movements throughout the world.
Last week. The New York Times carried a sizeable
article on how Ivan l&tarchev, the anti-communist
chief prosecutor in Sofia these days, is prying the
details of these transactions out of the Bulgarian
archives. The recipients of the comradely help from
Bulgaria included the sister regimes in Angola and
Ethiopia, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and
— not least—the Sandinistas of Nicaragua and similar movements in other Central American countries.
The significance of these revelations is not so
much that they are new but that they are now being
confirmed by archival evidence from theformerBulgarianregime.They are not new because, beginning
in the late 1970s and continuing on into the Reagan
administration, experts on intemational terrorism
and insurgency began to tumble to the fart that many
terrorist and guerrilla groups were receiving lots of
help from the Soviets and their satellites. When the
Reagan administration entered office, its officials —
Secretary of State Al Haig, CIA Director William
Casey, U.N. Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick,
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, et al. —•
made very specific charges that the Soviets were supporting terrorism. It was the first time such high U.S.
officials had made that charge.
The Soviets themselves immediately and hotly
denied i t Support terrorism? Us? You've got to be kidding. Ifs you, the West, that supports terrorism.
And, for the next several years, those in the Western
media who never failed to follow the Soviet line
regurgitated the charge. There just was "no evidence" that the Soviets supported terrorism, but
there was plenty of evidence that the United States
did — e.g., the "contras" in Nicaragua.
Actually, there was always an abundance of evidence for Soviet and satellite support for terrorism
— the testimony of former Soviet Bloc officials who
knewfirsthandabout it; the testimony of former ter-
rorists and guerrillas who had received training in
the Soviet Bloc; literally boatloads of documents from
every part of the world; and finally the weapons
themselves.
But last week, The Times reported that "The
accusations . . . were difficult to prove, especially
when Western officials said the charges were based
on Intelligence sources' that they could not disclose." Actually, most Western officials never said
anything of the kind. Fbr instance, soon after the Rea gan administration entered office, it published
through the State Department a White Paper on
"Communist Intervention in El Salvador," providrng
deep documentation of how the Soviets, Vietnamese.
Cubans and East Europeans had provided weapons
to the Salvadoran guerrillas. There was also documentationforsimilar helptothe Sandinistas. The left
went to work on this documentation and soon was
abletoplant m^jor news stories challenging it.
But last week, lo and behold, it turned out that what
the Bulgarian archives contain is confirmation of
much of what the Reagan administration claimed. In
1982,forexample, the Salvadoran Communist chief,
Jorge Shafik Handal, induced the Bulgarians to help
train Salvadoran pilotstohelpfiyarms and ammunition into the country. This is contrarytowhat the Salvadoran communist claimed at the time, when they
said their arms were being transported on donkeys
Then Mr. Handal, according to the new Bulgarian uocuiueitts, went to Sofia as the representative of
the main Salvadoran guerrilla front, which always
strongly denied it had any communist connections.
On that occasion, Mr. Handal also mentioned that
East Gennany had given the group $2 million the
previous year.
And so on The Bulgarian archives show money
and arms being sent to Honduran communists, as
well as to the Israeli Communist Party, andtoLibya,
which used them to arm a puppet insurgency group
in Chad. "This is history," one Bulgarian investigator told the Times. So it is, but not too long ago, it
wasnt history, and it wasn't even news. Some people
(mentioned above) knew it and triedtotell the world,
and other people didn't know it, or wouldn't pay attention, or knew and told something else. Now history
knows who was right and who was wrong.

Clinton Orders End to Vietnam Trade Embargo (Washn)
By Paul Richter and Michael Ross= (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON Taking a h i s t o r i c step to close the wounds of a d i v i s i v e war,
President Clinton Thursday ordered an immediate end to a 19-year trade embargo
against Vietnam.
Clinton, setting aside any economic rationale, asserted that he made the
move entirely as a means of resolving remaining questions about the fate of
missing U.S. s o l d i e r s .
" ' I a absolutely convinced i t offers us the best way to resolve the fate
m
of those who remain, and about whom we are not sure,'* he said at a White
House ceremony. ' " I have said that any decisions about our relationship with
Vietnam should be guided by one factor and one factor alone gaining the
f u l l e s t possible accounting for our prisoners of war and our missing in
action.'•
Vietnam's help in answering these questions has recently produced
'substantial progress'' in accounting for missing soldiers, he said, adding
that "'we would lose leverage i f there were no forward movement' i n
improving relations. And i f the Vietnamese lose i n t e r e s t in heilping to find
the missing, Clinton said, the embargo could be re-imposed.
The step, s t i l l short of f u l l normalization of relations, culminates years
of anguished public deliberation. Although many Vietnam veterans pushed for
l i f t i n g the embargo, major veterans groups condemned the move by a
commander-in-chief who avoided military service.
' W think that the advice given to the president was wrong and we told
"e
him that,'' John Sommer, director of the Washington o f f i c e of the American
Legion, said a f t e r meeting with the president and other veterans' leaders in
the White House. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, Vietnam Veterans of America,
and Disabled Veterans of America, who also attended the meeting with Clinton,
a l l opposed the embargo's end. The nation's largest POW/MIA family group, the
National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast
Asia, was so angry that i t s representative, Ann M i l l s G r i f f i t h s , boycotted the
session.
But despite the protests of veterans' and s o l d i e r s ' family groups, the
broader public mood may have been suggested l a s t week when the Senate voted
62-38 to urge the president to l i f t the ban. Other lawmakers, including some
Vietnam veterans, signaled t h e i r support Thursday for Clinton's action.
"This was the right decision,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
a highly decorated Vietnam veteran who headed a year-long Senate investigation
into the POW/MIA issue. '"The president can be proud of the fact he took the
extra year to make sure we got more (information) from Vietnam. And we got
more. ...'' Also h a i l i n g the decision were Gen. William-Westmoreland, who
commanded U.S. forces in Vietnam, and Gen. John W Vessey, a former chainnan
.
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and an emissary to Hanoi on the issue.
The end to the ban i s expected to produce a quick boost for some U.S.
companies, and by one estimate may generate an added $9 b i l l i o n in trade this
year. U.S. o f f i c i a l s w i l l open a " l i a i s o n o f f i c e ' ' in Hanoi to oversee
American i n t e r e s t s .
The action also opens the p o s s i b i l i t y that the United States, which has
lost military bases in the Philippines, may be able to forge an important
strategic a l l i a n c e in Southeast Asia to offset the influence of China.
Clinton declared l a s t July he would maintain the embargo u n t i l Vietnam
proved i t s willingness to help provide a f u l l accounting of the missing
serviceman. In c i t i n g progress on that front, Clinton pointed to four areas:
Since last July, the remains of 39 American servicemen have been
recovered.
The number of inadequately explained ''discrepancy c a s e s ' have fallen
from 135 to 73.
Vietnam and Laos have stepped up t h e i r cooperation i n the searches for
1

remains along t h e i r common border.
The Vietnamese have released important documents from t h e i r archives,
including those from a n t i - a i r c r a f t units along the Ho Chi Minh t r a i l , and from
a ''military p o l i t i c a l u n i t , ' o f f i c i a l s said.

�(Begin o p t i o n a l t r i m )
U.S. o f f i c i a l s said they have other incentives, short of a resumption of
the embargo, t o assure continued Vietnamese cooperation. The booming nation
s t i l l wants f u l l diplomatic r e l a t i o n s w i t h the United States, entry i n t o
i n t e r n a t i o n a l f i n a n c i a l i n s t i t u t i o n s , and assistance from trade promotion
programs.
Clinton said h i s a d m i n i s t r a t i o n has 500 people working on the search
''more than any other a d m i n i s t r a t i o n . '

Clinton said a l l h i s senior m i l i t a r y and diplomatic advisers and a l l h i s

Economic motives were so f a r removed, he said, t h a t the administration d i d not

Clinton's Move on Vietnam an Unusual, Unexpected Step (Washn)
By Doyle McManus= (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON When B i l l Clinton became president a year ago, the
conventional wisdom among foreign policy experts was that improving relations
between the United States and Vietnam had just moved onto
a distant back burner.
Clinton had spent much of his campaign answering charges that he had
maneuvered to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War. And only weeks after he
came to the White House, the new president was embroiled in another emotional
military issue, h i s order to allow gays to serve i n the armed forces.
So i t seemed unlikely that Clinton would take bold steps on the touchy
question of Vietnam.
' I f t h i s issue waits for a Clinton administration,'' one Indochina expert
said before the inauguration,
"we might have to wait u n t i l (1995) or even
longer.''
In fact, Clinton and his aides quietly began moving on Vietnam almost
immediately denying a l l the while that they had made any firm decisions. They
devised what Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord called ""an incremental
strategy,'* moving one small step at a time through the p o l i t i c a l minefield of
the prisoner-of-war issue. They frequently stopped to gauge public reactions
before moving forward.
On Thursday, Clinton f i n a l l y took a major public step, l i f t i n g the U.S.
trade embargo that has applied to Communist-ruled North Vietnam for 3 0 years
and to South Vietnam since i t f e l l to the Communists 19 years ago.
" I have made the judgment that the best way to ensure cooperation from
Vietnam (on accounting for troops missing in the war) ... i s to end the trade
embargo,*' Clinton said.
The move drew c r i t i c i s m from groups representing the families of Vietnam
POWs and MIAs but praise from most of Congress, including some frequent
Clinton c r i t i c s .
' " I think the president has handled t h i s very w e l l , e s p e c i a l l y given the
circumstances surrounding his involvement in the i s s u e , ' ' said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., a conservative former POW who has campaigned for more normal
relations with Vietnam.
Indeed, for a president who has come to grief i n other forays into foreign
policy, from Somalia and Bosnia to Haiti, the careful but steady march toward
l i f t i n g the trade embargo stands out as a notable case of sure-footedness.
O f f i c i a l s offer several reasons for the administration's success.
One i s that Clinton decided early in h i s administration on a set of clear,
precise goals, which has not been the case on some issues. A second important
factor i s that Vietnam, anxious for U.S. trade and investment, cooperated
enthusiastically.
And a third, i r o n i c a l l y , was the p o l i t i c a l s e n s i t i v i t y of the MIA issue.
I t captured Clinton's attention in a way that only a few other foreign policy
problems have, focused the policy c l e a r l y on winning cooperation from the
Vietnamese and ensured that the problem would get top-level treatment -hen
decisions were needed.
" T h i s i s one issue where he has c l e a r l y delineated h i s p r i o r i t i e s , ' a
senior o f f i c i a l said of Clinton. "We often have some tension between goals
when we're pursuing relations with various countries security, human rights,
economics. ... This i s one case where the p r i o r i t i e s were firmly established.
In t h i s case, ( i t was) the MIA i s s u e . • '
1
lit
�(Optional add end)
Clinton was lucky on one other count: He basically agreed with the policy
that his predecessor, George Bush, was already following. In 1991, Bush had
given Vietnam what o f f i c i a l s called ' a road map'' for improved relations with
the United States. At the top of the map was greater cooperation on clearing
up the cases of more than 2,000 servicemen l i s t e d as missing from the Vietnam
War.
In his campaign, Clinton never e x p l i c i t l y endorsed Bush's policy, which
had drawn c r i t i c i s m from POW-MIA family groups. Instead, battling his own
Vietnam problem, he gave the impression that he would be extra tough on the
issue.
"'This i s personally a very big issue with me,'' he said. At a town
meeting ' in Detroit, he told a P W a c t i v i s t that he would "'make i t clear to
O
Vietnam and to the other countries in Southeast Asia that f u l l normalization
of relationships depends upon an accounting for every single one of those
people.''
But two weeks after the election, Clinton offered a s l i g h t l y softer line
and one that turned out to be the policy he followed. Instead of demanding a
complete accounting, something military experts say i s a practical
impossibility, Clinton called on Vietnam to provide ""the most extensive and
good faith possible effort'• to account for the missing.
The f i r s t steps were halting and thrown off course by unexpected events.
State Department and National Security Council o f f i c i a l s began drawing up
policy papers within weeks of the inauguration. As an i n i t i a l move, they
suggested, Clinton could drop the U.S. objection to new loans for Vietnam from
the International Monetary Fund.
But in February, the administration found i t s e l f embroiled in the
controversy over gays in the military, prompting caution on other military
issues. And in A p r i l , a Harvard researcher published
a document from Soviet archives which charged Vietnam with deliberately
concealing the survival of hundreds of U.S. prisoners in 1972. That touched
off an uproar among POW-MIA groups and forced a three-month postponement of
the IMF move.
By July, Clinton was ready to take h i s f i r s t major step. On the Friday
before the July 4 weekend a time chosen partly because Congress was out of
town and the public was heading for the holidays the White House announced
that the United States was dropping i t s opposition to new loans for Vietnam.
At the same time, Clinton l a i d out four s p e c i f i c areas where he wanted
more cooperation from Hanoi before the United States would l i f t the trade
embargo: the recovery of remains of servicemen who died in Vietnam, the
resolution of cases in which MIAs might have survived, faster delivery of
Vietnamese documents that could contain information about MIAs and a joint
effort with Laos to search that country's border with Vietnam.
The White House held i t s breath for public reaction. ""Some people were
worried that the sky would f a l l , ' ' a senior o f f i c i a l recalled. "'They were
pleasantly surprised when i t didn't.''
A few weeks l a t e r , Clinton sent three o f f i c i a l s to Hanoi to assess
Vietnam's performance: Lord, Deputy Secretary of Veterans A f f a i r s Herschel
Gober, and L t . Gen. Michael E. Ryan, an aide to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
The o f f i c i a l s talked with much of Vietnam's Communist hierarchy
and with the U.S. military experts s i f t i n g through a i r c r a f t crash s i t e s on
the ground. They looked at cardboard boxes with b i t s of bones and teeth, at
nattered old dog tags, at tattered, faded logs from Vietnamese a n t i - a i r c r a f t
units recounting the survival or death of U.S. p i l o t s whose planes were shot
iown. And they came away impressed.

Ending of Vietnam Embargo Renews MIA Controversy (Washn)
By Richard A. Serrano=
(c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON On May 14, 19 68, Navy Lt. (j.g.) Barry E. Karger was 2 2 years
old, piloting an A-4F a i r c r a f t over North Vietnam's Quang Binh province when
he radioed: '"I'm r o l l i n g i n ! '
1
More than 25 years would pass before his fate would be known. Last month,
Karger's remains three teeth in a fragment of his lower jaw were dug out of
a r i v e r where his plane crashed after i t was shot down while he was dropping
electronic sensors along the Ho Chi Minh T r a i l .
Karger, who had been considered "missing in action/body not recovered '
a l l these years, was now positively enrolled among the dead.
But with President Clinton's decision Thursday t o l i f t the trade embargo
against Vietnam, many a c t i v i s t s and family members of the 2,238 others s t i l l
o f f i c i a l l y unaccounted for fear he w i l l be the l a s t one positively identified.
Without the embargo as leverage, they say, Vietnam w i l l no longer feel the
need to cooperate with U.S. recovery efforts.
" ' I don't think we should do anything for Vietnam,'' Karger's s i s t e r ,
Sheryl Mossman of Medford, Ore., said Thursday. " ' I wouldn't walk across the
street for Vietnam. I wouldn't send them a bag of flour. They have no regard
for human l i f e and no matter what we do, i t doesn't mean anything to them.'•
But in announcing h i s decision, Clinton pointed to several key areas in
which progress has been made in resolving the POW-MIA issue and he repeated
his belief that the Vietnamese w i l l continue to cooperate.
He noted that since l a s t July, the remains of 39 American servicemen have
been recovered and sent home. He said the number of '"discrepancy cases'"
where i t was possible servicemen could have survived also has been reduced
since July, from 135 to 73.
The president said Vietnam and Laos have become more helpful in conducting
searches along t h e i r common border and continue to release documents that
could help answer many of the lingering questions about missing Americans.
Military personnel working with the Hanoi government contend that Hanoi
w i l l continue to work closely with U.S. o f f i c i a l s to open up more crash s i t e s
and to make more records available.
And they discount allegations by some a c t i v i s t s that POWs are s t i l l living
in Vietnam but would be k i l l e d now that they no longer serve as bargaining
chips for improved business relations with the United States.
'"The Vietnamese,'' said Lt. Col. David Fredrikson, a spokesman for the
Joint Task Force F u l l Accounting office in Honolulu, ""already give us pretty
much a l l that we ask for.'' The task force was established to investigate
cases of missing servicemen.

Fredrikson j u s t returned from a t r i p to Vietnam i n December, where U.S.
military o f f i c i a l s worked with the Hanoi government digging up s i t e s that
night hold American remains.
'The Vietnamese say they consider t h i s a humanitarian issue, whether
zhere's an embargo l i f t e d or not,'' Fredrikson said. "'They say they want to
lelp American families find answers to t h e i r questions.••
To dramatize that point, he said, Vietnamese o f f i c i a l s allowed U.S. f i e l d
:eams to dig through a c i v i l i a n graveyard in search of American remains. He
said family members of Vietnamese interred there even allowed the American
:eams to dig up Vietnamese graves.
No evidence of Americans was found, he said.
But Fredrikson did not discount the p o s s i b i l i t y that Vietnam's cooperation
ay have been linked to hopes that the embargo would be l i f t e d .
"'There i s so much economic need in that country for some of the things
he Western World can provide that i t obviously i s on everyone's mind,'' he
aid.
�(End optional trim)
I n the t h r e e years since the J o i n t Task Force F u l l Accounting o f f i c e was
established, the remains of 29 i n d i v i d u a l s have been i d e n t i f i e d . But with new
technological advances, o f f i c i a l s hope more i d e n t i f i c a t i o n s can be made from
the remains now a t the m i l i t a r y laboratory i n Honolulu.
They also note t h a t Vietnam has approved more excavations and that U.S.
i n v e s t i g a t i v e teams are scheduled t o t r a v e l there t h i s month.
''These are a i r crash and b a t t l e s i t e s , • ' he said. ' T h e r e w i l l be a l o t
of digging.''
Within the year, he said, the task force expects to run out of crash sites
to explore.
(Optional Add End)
Fredrikson and other task force members acknowledged that i t w i l l be
impossible ever to identify a l l the missing, particularly those lost in a i r
crashes over the ocean. And he said that a l l reports of l i v e POWs are
investigated but that, so far, a l l have proven to be false.
In addition, the Pentagon determined l a s t month that a new Russian
document claiming that Vietnam held 1,205 American prisoners in 1972 more
than twice as many as they released a year l a t e r was f u l l of "'inaccuracies,
inconsistencies, exaggerations and f a b r i c a t i o n s .
But J . Thomas Burch J r . , a former Green Beret and chairman of the National
Vietnam Veterans Coalition in Washington, said Thursday that h i s group
believes as many as 200 Americans may s t i l l be captive in Vietnam and Laos. He
isaid American v i s i t o r s to Vietnam, as well as Vietnamese c i t i z e n s , have
reported seeing Americans in prison and labor camps even i n caves north of
Hanoi.

Lifting Trade Embargo on Vietnam Signals New Era (Honolulu)
By Jim Mann= (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
HONOLULU Early t h i s week, Adm. Charles R. Larson, the commander in-chief
of U.S. forces in the P a c i f i c , sat back in his spacious headquarters office
above Pearl Harbor and mused about the p o s s i b i l i t y of a renewed U.S. military
relationship with Vietnam.
' ' I t ' s not inconceivable that our ships could once again v i s i t Cam Ranh
Bay,'' the commander told the Los Angeles Times, referring to the prized
Vietnamese port that has been used during the past 15 years by the fonner
Soviet Union and Russia.
That would be somewhat down the pike, and i t (the
arrangement) would be one of access rather than a permanent (U.S.) presence on
the ground.'
The remarks by the commander, who j u s t returned from a meeting with a
senior Vietnamese defense o f f i c i a l in Hanoi, underscored the strategic
implications of President Clinton's decision to l i f t the U.S. trade embargo
against Vietnam.
In one sense, the l i f t i n g of the trade embargo marks the end of the long
process of healing the scars of the Vietnam War, more than 20 years after the
l a s t U.S. troops came home. Yet Clinton's action could also mark the beginning
of something new: a realignment of the geopolitical map of East Asia, opening
the way for new diplomacy, new alignments and a l l i a n c e s .
Southeast Asia i s a region with a population and economic market as large
as those of Western Europe. Vietnam l i e s at the heart of i t . The l i f t i n g of
the trade embargo gives the United States not only a new market for i t s
products but also, more broadly, new opportunities to develop close t i e s with
what many believe i s now the most dynamic region on the globe.
And i t gives the United States new f l e x i b i l i t y and leverage in dealing
with China, Vietnam's h i s t o r i c adversary. Both China and Vietnam seek western
investment c a p i t a l . Both countries would l i k e greater access to American
technology, although China i s at a much more advanced l e v e l of development
than Vietnam.
The p o s s i b i l i t i e s of the improved relationship are intriguing and, to
students of history, tinged with irony.
Will the United States and i t s old Vietnamese a l l y now work together to
provide some sort of counterbalance to China's growing military power, in
effect limiting China's a b i l i t y to dominate Southeast Asia?
Will Vietnam now become a loyal member and, indeed, powerhouse of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the regional group that was founded,
with strong U.S. support, to prevent Vietnam from spreading i t s influence and
i t s Communist ideology into neighboring countries such as Thailand, Malaysia
and Singapore?
Will Hanoi develop close new t i e s with Taiwan? Private Taiwanese corrpames
have sunk so much money into Vietnam that Taiwan has now surpassed industrial
powers l i k e France and Japan to become the country's largest single source of
investment c a p i t a l .
"Vietnam has sent i t s financial leaders and economic o f f i c i a l s to v i s i t
Taiwan,'' said Taiwanese Foreign Minister Frederick Chien recently.
And how w i l l a l l these changes in Southeast Asia a f f e c t Japan, which has
drawn ever-closer economic links to the region but which i s s t i l l burdened by
the memories of World War I I ?
I f China keeps increasing i t s defense budget and i t s a i r and naval forces
to the point where Japan some day feels threatened, for example, Japan might
cooperate with the United States, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries
to offset China.
I f China seems l e s s worrisome in the future, Vietnam could become a
crossroads where Japan, China, the United States and the old colonial power,
France, compete for influence.
1
For the U.S. presence in Asia, Clinton's l i f t i n g of the trade embargo
represents the most important development since the United States was forced
two years ago to give up i t s strategic f a c i l i t i e s at Clark Air Force Base and
subic Bay Naval Station in the Philippines.
lib
�(Begin optional trim)
At that time, there were some fears in Southeast Asia that the United
States might withdraw from the region, leaving Japan and China as the major
powers.
U.S. military planners now maintain that the pullout from the Philippine
bases, which the United States had occupied since the beginning of the
century, has not been such a calamity.
''The withdrawal from the Philippine bases was far less traumatic than we
anticipated
said one senior U.S. military o f f i c i a l at the U.S. Pacific
Command in Honolulu t h i s week. 'Replacing Clark and Subic just i s n ' t on (the
agenda) anymore.'•
After the closure of the Philippine bases, U.S. military strategists
developed a new approach that they c a l l 'places, not bases.'' Instead of
seeking one or two major new American military i n s t a l l a t i o n s such as Clark and
Subic, the United States has negotiated deals with a number of countries that
permit a variety of l e s s intense military arrangements.
S t i l l , military cooperation with Vietnam would be a huge boon. The country
has a population of more than 70 million, located not far from Hong Kong and
the most prosperous areas of South China. Vietnam i s impoverished now, but i t
has an army that over the past 40 years has withstood France, the United
States and, most recently, China.
(End optional trim)
U.S. o f f i c i a l s i n s i s t that any sort of strategic or military cooperation
with Vietnam i s a long way off. They say that the f i r s t step in the process of
change in the region w i l l be for Vietnam to integrate i t s e l f into ASEAN and to
forge closer t i e s with i t s Southeast Asian neighbors.
U.S. o f f i c i a l s also contend that the improving t i e s with Vietnam are not
directed at China a country with which, after a l l , the Clinton administration
has been seeking to mend fences. ' ' I don't think China i s a near-term
threat,'' Larson said t h i s week. S t i l l , U.S. o f f i c i a l s regularly note that
China has increased i t s defense budget, i s building up i t s armed forces and
has made huge t e r r i t o r i a l claims in the South China Sea.
I t seems l i k e l y that when Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Paris in late January, the United
States privately informed China of U.S. plans to l i f t the trade embargo
against Vietnam. Christopher may well have assured Beijing that the move was
not aimed at China.
Of course, that i s roughly the same thing that the Nixon administraticn
told o f f i c i a l s in Moscow more than two decades ago when the United States was
forging a new relationship with China.
When Larson traveled to Hanoi late l a s t month, he was the highest-level

Big Business Objected t o Uncle Sam's Key Role i n Health Plan (Washn)
By Robert A. Rosenblatt=
(c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON A f t e r months of f l i r t i n g and teasing w i t h the White House over
health-care reform, the captains of American industry decided t o j u s t say no.
Members of the Business Roundtable, a c o l l e c t i o n of the c h i e f executives
of some of the nation's biggest corporations, t h i s week scorned Clinton's
overtures and embraced a r i v a l s u i t o r , Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., because they
could not e n t r u s t the government w i t h c o n t r o l over the cost and content of
health b e n e f i t s .
' " I t ' s not so much support for s p e c i f i c s of the Cooper b i l l , but rather
that i t moves us away from the Clinton plan,'• Mitchell Anderman, benefits
manager for Sun O i l , said Wednesday, a day after the Roundtable slapped down
the president's proposal.
The salvo i n t e n s i f i e d Wednesday, with a top o f f i c i a l of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce denouncing Clinton's plan as so ridden with demands for high
employer payments, fat benefits and new federal bureaucracy ""that i t cannot
even be used as a starting point*' for Congressional debate.
Although Clinton's plan would give big business something i t dearly wants
an end to the free ride for small companies that do not provide insurance
many executives have concluded that the price tag in other ways i s far too
high.
They simply refuse to believe the White House claim that corporations
under the Clinton plan would spend no more than 7.9 percent of their payroll
to buy an insurance package that includes comprehensive coverage for doctor
and hospitals b i l l s , plus payments for prescription drugs and home care for
the chronically i l l .
" " I f we can believe those numbers i t would sound great, but I find them
hard to believe,•' said Anderman.
Bob Batey, benefits manager at Ameritech, which provides telephone service
in the Midwest, said "'we're a f r a i d the 7.9 percent i s just a s t a r t i n g point.
I don't think i t ' s fixed in granite; i t w i l l keep moving.''
The Roundtable's decision to endorse the Cooper plan i s a d i r e c t slap at
Clinton, and a repudiation of h i s administration's efforts to e n l i s t business
support, or at l e a s t neutrality, in the early stages of the debate.
Clinton's plan requires business to offer health insurance to a l l workers,
with the company paying 80 percent of the cost and the worker 20 percent.
Cooper's plan says coverage should be voluntary.
C l i n t o n wants most Americans t o j o i n l o c a l h e a l t h a l l i a n c e s , which work as
g i a n t buying organizations on behalf of consumers. Corporations say t h i s robs
them of t h e i r a b i l i t y t o manage and c o n t r o l the h e a l t h programs f o r t h e i r
employees.
"'We're out of the benefits business we lose complete control of the
system and i t ' s a l l up to the government, ' said Dan S p i l l e r , manager of
benefit plans for the Mead Corp. 'That's completely unacceptable.''

(Optional add

Health benefits now are not covered by federal laws; a company i s free to
change or modify i t s coverage without any interference from government. The
big companies want to keep that freedom to save money by r e s t r i c t i n g benefits
as they see f i t and forcing workers to pay more for the cost of insurance.
The White House thought i t would ensure support from businesses offering
insurance by i n s i s t i n g on a universal mandate a law forcing a l l companies to
provide coverage. That would l i f t $26 b i l l i o n from industries that pay extra
now because other companies offei. iio insurance at a l l .
But t h i s sweetener isn't enough, business i s now t e l l i n g Clinton.

O f f i c i a l s Rethinking Tack After Business Spurns Health Plan (Washn)
By David Lauter=
(c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON Stung by business rejection of their health proposal, Clinton
administration o f f i c i a l s reassessed t h e i r strategy Thursday, hoping to regroup
with support from labor, advocates for the elderly and t h e i r a l l i e s i n
Congress.
Throughout the health care debate, the president and his a l l i e s have been
tugged between opposing strategies either accommodating business in the hopes
of gaining t h e i r support or building a coalition strong enough to force
business to accommodate them.
Clinton, who often worked with business leaders while governor of
Arkansas, has often advocated the former path, hoping that i f he worked with
business leaders on issues of concern to them such as l a s t year's debate
over the North American Free Trade Agreement they would work with him on
such issues as health care. Several top aides, including Chief of Staff
Thomas F. •'Mack'* McLarty and economic policy chief Robert Rubin, have
advocated that approach.
But in the wake of the rejection of h i s health plan by the Business
Roundtable an organization of the nation's largest corporations in favor of
a competing, more conservative plan offered by Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn.,
o f f i c i a l s admitted their wooing of business had so far achieved r e l a t i v e l y
l i t t l e . And they seemed to be preparing for a tack to the l e f t .
Publicly, Clinton and his senior aides insisted nothing had changed.
' ' I wouldn't read too much into i t . This i s the beginning of what w i l l be
a protracted l e g i s l a t i v e discussion, ' Clinton said, referring to the Business
Roundtable vote and a separate statement Thursday by the Chamber of Commerce
opposing Clinton's plan.
'We're going to work with everybody, ' said Clinton's senior adviser
George Stephanopoulos. " T h i s i s j u s t l e g i s l a t i v e jockeying, ' he said.
But Stephanopoulos conceded that Clinton and his aides were
""disappointed'' that the Roundtable, many of whose members Clinton had
courted l a s t year during the long debate over the North American Free Trade
Agreement, had turned against the White House on health care.
Some of Clinton's a l l i e s were far more blunt. '"There's a special place in
h e l l waiting for Bob Winters,•• said Sen. John D. "'Jay'' Rockefeller IV,
D-W.Va., referring to the chief executive of the Prudential insurance company,
who drafted the business group's resolution attacking Clinton's plan.
Rockefeller has been one of Clinton's chief a l l i e s in the health care battle
and has sought to work with Prudential and other large insurance companies.
"The sadness,'' said another senior o f f i c i a l , " " i s that we r e a l l y think
health reform i s in the interest of business, p a r t i c u l a r l y the big businesses,
most of whom provide health insurance for their workers. But i t appears their
reaction was more ideological than pragmatic.•'
Other Democrats, including some within the White House, insisted that
Clinton and h i s aides should have expected that sort of response and that the
idea of gaining support from groups l i k e the Roundtable was fundamentally
flawed to begin with.
" ' I t was a t a c t i c a l error,'' said one aide.
' I t was an amazing idea to ever think they'd get the Business Roundtable
to endorse t h e i r b i l l , ' ' said Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., who i s one of
the key l e g i s l a t o r s on health issues. ''These organizations are the mainstay
of the Republican constituency.''
Some business leaders and conservative l e g i s l a t o r s suggested after the
Roundtable's vote that the White House should now begin negotiations with
Cooper and with moderate Republicans to forge a compromise b i l l . But
administration o f f i c i a l s rejected that notion. ' " I t ' s way too early for
negotiations,'' said one s t r a t e g i s t .
1

Clinton aides appear to be pinning considerable hopes on the a b i l i t y of
l i b e r a l Democrats in the House to defeat Cooper's plan, allowing the
administration to negotiate later from a position of greater strength. They
noted that no congressional votes on the issue are expected for at l e a s t a
month.
�(Optional add end)
Others suggested t h a t as a t t e n t i o n i n c r e a s i n g l y focuses on Cooper's plan,
support f o r i t w i l l wane. 'Cooper i s the f l a v o r of the month,'' said an
administration o f f i c i a l ,
'put i t under the hot l i g h t s f o r a few weeks, and
watch i t melt.'•
Several a d m i n i s t r a t i o n aides and advisers separately pointed t o the b a t t l e
over health reform i n Washington state i n 1992 as a model of what may be
ahead. 'They passed i t without any business support,• one aide said.
L i b e r a l Democrats, many of whom have long feared C l i n t o n was going too f a r
to accommodate moderates, already have begun aiming t h e i r f i r e a t Cooper's
proposal.
Cooper's b i l l 'cannot pass. I t does not have the votes i n my committee
and w i l l not have the votes i n t h e House,•' Waxman f l a t l y predicted. Among
other problems, Waxman noted, a c e n t r a l feature of Cooper's plan i s t o remove
the t a x d e d u c t i b i l i t y of most h e a l t h plans t h a t companies give t h e i r workers,
thus d r i v i n g up the costs of h e a l t h insurance f o r the great m a j o r i t y of
Americans. Cooper argues t h a t step would give people i n c e n t i v e t o choose
cheaper health plans, but such proposals have seldom been a t t r a c t i v e i n
Congress.

Federally Insured Deposits Helped Pay Off Clinton Loan (Washn)
By Sara Fritz= (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON Federally insured deposits were diverted from Madison Guaranty
Savings & Loan of L i t t l e Rock, Ark., in 1985 to make a $7,300 payment on a
personal bank loan owed by then-Gov. B i l l Clinton and his wife, Hillary, as
part of their investment in the Whitewater real estate development, according
to congressional
investigators.
James McDougal, owner of the t h r i f t and the Clintons' business partner in
the Whitewater real estate venture, used the Madison funds to make the payment
on a loan the Clintons had obtained to build a model home on the s i t e of the
development, Republican staff investigators said.
I f corroborated by the ongoing broad federal inquiry into the Whitewater
deal, the payment would be evidence that federally insured funds were used to
subsidize the Clintons' controversial, i l l - f a t e d real estate venture with
McDougal and his former wife, Susan.
And the transaction provides a further indication that matters involving
Whitewater were not always handled in arms-length, by-the-book fashion.
The $7,300 was not a formal loan to the Clintons, investigators indicated,
but rather an informal payment that helped them at a time when Whitewater was
experiencing d i f f i c u l t i e s . The development eventually f a i l e d and Madison was
later closed by federal regulators in a bailout that cost the U.S. Treasury
more than $47 million.
The Clintons, who became business partners with the McDougals in 1978,
have said they were purely passive investors in Whitewater and were unaware of
any improper or i l l e g a l actions McDougal may have made involving Whitewater.
Republicans on the House Banking Committee, however, are pressing for a
f u l l public accounting of what they believe was a cozy business relationship
between the then-governor and McDougal that may have permitted Madison to
operate without s t r i c t state regulatory oversight.
''This i s clear evidence of a small amount of f i r e amidst the smoke,''
said Rep. Jim Leach, R-lowa, ranking Republican on the House Banking
Committee, whose staff uncovered the evidence.
'Given the above circumstances,•• said a m m written to Leach by his
eo
staff, ' ' i t would appear that federally insured deposits, which, with the
later f a i l u r e of Madison, became, in effect, taxpayer obligations, were
transferred for the d i r e c t personal benefit of the former governor.•'
Both the Clintons and Whitewater took a tax deduction for paying interest
on the loan. White House aides have said i t was an accidental double
deduction. However, t h i s new information may raise the question of whether
the Clintons also f a i l e d to report the payment on t h e i r tax return as
personal income.
(Optional add
end)
As the memo to Leach noted: "What remains unclear i s the larger question
of whether the funds provided by Madison to reduce the Clintons' l i a b i l i t y
were proper or properly reported as income for income tax purposes ....
' I f Madison provided any direct or indirect assistance to Whitewater,
presumably half the value of such (assistance) would redound to the advantage
of each of the half-owners. In any regard, the above money transfer
underscores that then-Gov. Clinton has personal l i a b i l i t i e s reduced by a
payment from Madison.
Such payment presumably c a r r i e s e t h i c a l as well as tax implications and
i s part and parcel of the $47 million to $60 million estimated taxpayer loss
at Madison.''
McDougal, who became a friend of Clinton in the late 1960s, when both men
worked for Sen. J . William Fulbright, D-Ark., was removed from control of
Madison i n 1986 after federal regulators concluded he had followed unsound
practices. He was t r i e d and acquitted on charges of bank fraud.

of the deal and I want you t o keep up yours.... You have t o say: "I'm going t o
make the most of my l i f e . ' ''
Clinton has been s t e a d i l y expanding h i s emphasis on family values and
personal r e s p o n s i b i l i t y and winning p l a u d i t s from l i b e r a l and conservative
audiences f o r doing so. Even i n l a s t week's State of the Union address,

Asked how to fight gangs, Clinton observed that most people want to belong

Perry Sworn In as New Defense Secretary (Washn)
By Art Pine= (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON William J . Perry was sworn in Thursday as President Clinton's
new secretary of defense, ending a 7&l/2-week-long effort by the
administration to replace departing Secretary Les Aspin, who was forced to
step down.
The 66-year-old former Stanford University engineering professor took the
oath of office in a private ceremony at the Pentagon after the Senate voted
97-0 to confirm his nomination. E a r l i e r , the Senate Armed Services Committee
endorsed the appointment unanimously.
The vote Thursday followed a 3&l/2-hour-long hearing before the Armed
Services panel on Wednesday during which Perry, who has served as Aspin's
deputy for the past 11 months, won unabashed plaudits from senators for his
stand on national security issues.
The new defense chief faces a spate of challenges and problems in guiding
the military establishment through i t s post-Cold War cutbacks. His f i r s t
assignment, next week, w i l l be to present the administration's new defense
budget to Congress.
The confirmation was rushed through at the request of the administration,
in part so that Perry could attend an international conference of defense
ministers in Munich, Germany t h i s weekend. He i s expected to leave late Friday
and return to Washington Sunday evening.
A high technology expert wh^ has become known as the godfather of the
radar-evading Stealth bomber, Perry has spent the bulk of h i s career in the
defense industry as a consultant on super-secret weapons projects.
But he i s expected to move e a s i l y into broader defense issues, from
ensuring military preparedness to developing a national strategy for U.S.
intervention in situations such as Somalia and Bosnia.
The late-evening swearing-in ceremony capped an almost 2-month-long effort
by the administration to replace Aspin as defense secretary, after the fcrmer
Wisconsin congressman resigned in mid-December, e s s e n t i a l l y at Clinton's
request.
(Optional Add End)
Clinton i n i t i a l l y tapped retired Navy Adm. Bobby Ray Inman, a Texas
businessman, for the job, and l a t e r was l e f t dumbfounded and embarrassed
p o l i t i c a l l y after the admiral backed out of the nomination, saying he did not
want to face c r i t i c i s m from Congress and the media.
Perry i s expected e s s e n t i a l l y to go along with p o l i c i e s hammered out by
Aspin on such issues as the size of the armed forces, homosexuals in the
military and women in combat, and to leave most key s t a f f positions v i r t u a l l y
unchanged.
But colleagues say they expect him to be more decisive and articulate than
his predecessor and better at managing the Pentagon. They also predict he w i l l
abandon Aspin's efforts to thrust the Defense Department into the heart of the
administration's foreign-policymaking apparatus.

Western P o l i t i c i a n s Force Baca Resignation (Washn)
By Melissa Healy= (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON Jim Baca, the Clinton administration's embattled Bureau of
Land Management director, resigned under pressure Thursday after r i l i n g a host
of Western l e g i s l a t o r s and governors with his efforts to reform the management
of public lands throughout the West.
Baca's departure was the f i r s t sign of open dissension between the
administration and environmentalists over how aggressively to press for change
in the use of public lands by miners, ranchers and the timber industry. I t
came after three governors Colorado's Roy Romer, Wyoming's Mike Sullivan and
Idaho's Cecil Andrus sought Baca's removal by the White House.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt made clear that Baca, a favorite of
environmentalists for his views on land reform, has been too confrontational.
But Babbitt vowed that Baca's resignation would not blunt the administration's
drive for land-use reform.
"'Jim and I have different approaches to management style and consensus
building,'' Babbitt said Thursday. "The management styles of the department's
bureau directors need to mesh. They need to work with me,•' he added.
One Clinton administration o f f i c i a l said that Baca had an "'in-your-face''
style that made him a " l i g h t n i n g rod' for controversy and distracted from
Babbitt's efforts to gain cooperation from traditional opponents to refonn.
The 11,800-person Bureau of Land Management part of the Department of the
Interior oversees 270 million acres of public lands located primarily in
Western states and supervises mineral leasing and mining on an additional 300
million acres.
Baca's forced resignation stunned and angered environmentalists and drew
sharp words from some of the administration's most ardent environmental a l l i e s
on Capitol H i l l .
Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Baca "'had the unenviable job of
dragging a l o t of privileged, pampered and powerful interests, kicking and
screaming, into the 20th century.'• Miller added that the administration
' c a r r i e s a very heavy burden'' to demonstrate i t i s not backing away from an
ambitious agenda of reform j u s t because i t has met resistance.
*"We think this i s a dreadful mistake,' said Deborah Seas of the Sierra
Club. " ' I t ' s going to send a c h i l l i n g message to every p o l i t i c a l appointee. I t
says i f you make waves, your head i s going to r o l l . * •
Sources said Baca may be replaced by Ken Salazar, who resigned Thursday
from h i s post as director of Colorado's Department of Natural Resources. The
appointment of Salazar would l i k e l y blunt anger among Latino groups, who
counted Baca's appointment to the BLM directorship as a victory. And Salazar,
who has helped mediate
a decades-long dispute over a tract of privately owned land in Colorado, is
considered a c o n c i l i a t o r .

(Optional Add End)
One administration o f f i c i a l active in shaping environmental policy said
the Baca resignation has put President Clinton, who was said to have approved
Baca's removal, in a d i f f i c u l t p o l i t i c a l position.
"What does the administration gain?'' asked the o f f i c i a l . " A r e Romer and
Sullivan and Andrus a l l going to be happy with a l l our reforms now? No.
Instead they're j u s t going to think that they can get t h e i r way i f they press
hard enough.••
Several foes of the Clinton administration's reform efforts also used the
resignation to caution Babbitt that h i s plans for grazing, mining and timber
reform w i l l continue to inflame rural Westerners, with or without Baca. Rep.
Mike Synar, D-Okla., said Babbitt " " w i l l learn you can arrange the chairs on
1
the deck of the T i t a n i c , but i t ' s s t i l l going down. '
Environmentalists said they were stung by Babbitt's decision to demand
Baca's resignation and by the White House's approval of the move. I t came a
day after House l e g i s l a t o r s spurned eleventh-hour appeals from the White House
and shelved a vote to elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet
status.

Republicans Force Delay in Military's New Rules on Gays (Washn)
By Art Pine= (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON Senate Republicans forced a new round of hearings on the
gays-in-the-military controversy Thursday, prompting the Pentagon to delay
publishing long-awaited final regulations on the issue.
Only hours before the new regulations were to have been made public, the
Senate Armed Services Committee announced that, at the insistence of i t s GOP
members, i t would conduct further hearings. I t said that the sessions could
s t a r t as early as next week.
A few minutes later, the Defense Department said that the regulations,
which had been scheduled to be distributed Friday, would be delayed
indefinitely ostensibly because of the heavy volume of paperwork involved.
O f f i c i a l s on both sides said that the delay was prompted by llth-hour
objections by Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., one of the Senate's most vocal opponents
of allowing homosexuals to serve in the military.
Besides i n s i s t i n g on new hearings. Coats has demanded changes in the

alterations are not major but the Pentagon has opposed them as unnecessary.

I t was not immediately clear how long the l a t e s t dispute would delay
publication of the new regulations. Pentagon o f f i c i a l s said that they expect a
holdup of only a couple of weeks but some analysts warned that i t could be
longer i f tempers f l a r e .
Despite the acquiescence of the Armed Services Committee Thursday, there
were indications that the panel's leadership was embarrassed by Coats' move.
Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., had been working closely with the Defense Department
and had endorsed the new rules.
Moreover, GOP s t r a t e g i s t s said that the push for new hearings had only
lukewarm backing from the panel's Republicans.

House Sends Quake Aid B i l l to Senate for Approval (Washn)
By Alan C. Miller and William J . Eaton= (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON The House Thursday swiftly sent the $8.6 b i l l i o n California
earthquake r e l i e f b i l l to the Senate, paving the way for f i n a l congressional
approval by the end of next week.
' I t was r e a l l y a magnificent victory and i t w i l l help speed t h i s through
the Senate,'' said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., dean of the California
delegation.
House Democrats, joined by a bloc of 26 Republicans, turned back
a determined effort by a bipartisan coalition to pay for the new spending with
deep reductions of $9.7 b i l l i o n in defense, transportation, community
development, foreign aid and other national programs. Following intensive
arm-twisting and cajoling, the margin was surprisingly decisive, 240-178.
Earlier, the House leadership had a scare when another proposal to cut
spending by $7.5 b i l l i o n was narrowly defeated, 211-207. Instead, with the
backing of the Democrats, the House voted for a r e l a t i v e l y modest $2.5 b i l l i o n
of cuts in various federal programs that i t had already passed l a s t year.
In the process, the b i l l ' s leading advocates from Southern California
worked doggedly to sidetrack proposals they said could have seriously
complicated t h e i r goal of pushing the measure through the Senate and on to
President Clinton next week. The b i l l passed by 337-74.
Underscoring the urgency of the timing, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency said Thursday i t has halted delivery of monies for rebuilding roads and
public structures in 20 states because a s t r i n g of recent natural disasters
have seriously depleted emergency funds.
With the federal disaster aid fund down to $200 million, o f f i c i a l s said
they acted to ensure they would be able to continue providing emergency
shelter and other immediate care to those stricken by the magnitude-6.6 Jan.
17 earthquake. FEMA o f f i c i a l s said they were continuing to provide
infrastructure repair funds to the Los Angeles disaster area, but only to meet
c r i t i c a l ' ' needs.
During i t s speedy adoption by the House t h i s week, the measure became
embroiled i n two highly charged p o l i t i c a l issues at the outset of an election
year: i l l e g a l immigration and d e f i c i t reduction. The b i l l emerged with
compromise amendments that i t s leading sponsors said would f o r e s t a l l potential
problems i n the Senate.
Thursday's vote was the culmination of a bid by d e f i c i t hawks of both
parties to attach a pay-as-you-go provision to the disaster r e l i e f b i l l rather
than add the new outlays to the massive federal d e f i c i t . Clinton and House
leaders maintained that the government should not suddenly change i t s
customary method of paying for emergency aid in the wake of a disaster.
(Optional add end)
In the cloakroom and on the House floor Thursday, key advocates of the
b i l l argued to wavering colleagues that adoption of the amendment to s l i c e
spending by $9.7 b i l l i o n over five years would mean trimming programs m their
own d i s t r i c t s to pay for Southern California's recovery.
Moreover, under the terms of the proposal, the cuts for the f i r s t year
would have had to be implemented in the next s i x months because the 199 4
f i s c a l year i s nearly half over. Sponsors of the r e l i e f b i l l said that could
have crippled programs such as drug enforcement, the FBI and border control
that are p r i o r i t i e s for many f i s c a l conservatives.
Even some of the most ardent supporters of the Clinton package agreed that
Congress should seek other ways to pay for d i s a s t e r r e l i e f i n the future. But
as Rep. Howard P. 'Buck'' McKeon, R-Calif., said, " ' I t should not be done on
the backs of the people who have suffered the tragedy.''
Following the b i l l ' s passage, the House leadership named a bipartisan task
force to examine other funding mechanisms.

B i l l Barring I l l e g a l s From Aid t o Have L i t t l e Impact (Los Angeles)
By Paul Feldman and Sonia Nazario= (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
LOS ANGELES The proposed congressional amendment b a r r i n g i l l e g a l
immigrants from r e c e i v i n g non-emergency earthquake a i d may have more of an
impact on election-year p o l i t i c s than a p r a c t i c a l e f f e c t on providing
assistance t o d i s a s t e r v i c t i m s , f e d e r a l o f f i c i a l s and immigration a c t i v i s t s
say.
For one t h i n g , the bulk of President Clinton's $8.6 b i l l i o n a i d package
would go toward f i x i n g freeways, schools and other p u b l i c f a c i l i t i e s rather
than a s s i s t i n g i n d i v i d u a l s . Moreover, much of the a i d t o i n d i v i d u a l s i s
earmarked f o r emergency shelter, food, and medical care a l l of which are
exempt from the proposed regulations.
Federal Emergency Management Agency d i r e c t o r James Lee Witt said the
amendment should have l i t t l e impact on h i s agency, which p r i m a r i l y d i s t r i b u t e s
short-term emergency a i d . 'The amendment I have seen wouldn't hinder our
e f f o r t s , • ' he said.
Emergency o f f i c i a l s say they have no idea what percentage of aid-seekers
are undocumented immigrants because they do not i n q u i r e , but Witt and others
said they thought the numbers were not sizable. Studies have shown t h a t most
undocumented workers do not seek long-term a i d from government agencies
because of fears of being deported. One such study showed t h a t Latinos
i n c l u d i n g i l l e g a l immigrants use government health and welfare b e n e f i t s at
h a l f the r a t e of Anglos and a f i f t h o f the r a t e of blacks, according t o
Professor David Hayes-Bautista of the U n i v e r s i t y of C a l i f o r n i a , Los Angeles.
"Not t h a t many undocumented w i l l apply f o r these programs,''
Hayes-Bautista s a i d . "Economically, i t i s meaningless.'
The proposed r e g u l a t i o n , introduced by Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., and
adopted i n modified form by the House Appropriations Committee, would be aimed
p r i m a r i l y a t excluding i l l e g a l immigrants from longer-term a i d programs such
as 18-month housing subsidy grants provided by the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and r e s i d e n t i a l and business l o w - i n t e r e s t loans offered by
the Small Business A d m i n i s t r a t i o n .
While the amendment bars federal agencies from g i v i n g long-term federal
d i s a s t e r a i d t o anyone they know t o be i l l e g a l , i t does not require them to
ask applicants t h e i r residency s t a t u s .
"Unless there i s a mandate t o ask, the federal agencies won't ask,'• said
Dan S t e i n , executive d i r e c t o r of the Federation f o r American Immigration
Reform, adding t h a t the amendment i s t h e r e f o r e l a r g e l y symbolic. "'We are
again seeing p o l i t i c a l fraud.''
But Packard said t h a t i f the amendment i s enacted, ""agencies w i l l
determine how t o implement the law.''
" " I f they choose t o not f i n d ways t o implement t h a t law, we w i l l f i n d ways

Government Learned Lessons i n Los Angeles Quake Aftermath (Washn)
By Glenn F. Bunting=
(c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON In their speedy response to the earthquake i n Los Angeles,
federal r e l i e f o f f i c i a l s badly underestimated the number of residents l e f t
homeless, contributed to long delays at assistance centers and were
overwhelmed by tens of thousands of non-English-speaking victims seeking help,
i t was disclosed Thursday at a Senate subcommittee hearing.
These were among the early lessons gleaned from an i n i t i a l review of the
federal government's reaction to earthquake-stricken Southern California by
the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on the Veterans Administration, Housing
and Urban Development and Independent Agencies.
There was a severe shortage of interpreters of Spanish and less common
languages, as became quickly apparent in the f i r s t few days after the Jan. 17
earthquake. For example, federal workers were taken aback when confronted with
a long line of predominantly Armenian victims outside a Hollywood emergency
assistance center.
At Thursday's hearing, Clinton administration o f f i c i a l s announced plans to
hold a daylong retreat in coming months to evaluate the performance of 13
federal agencies and 3,600 employees called upon after the quake.
The sheer magnitude of the 6.6. temblor marked uncharted t e r r i t o r y for
federal disaster o f f i c i a l s , who had never been called upon to provide
emergency assistance to so many people. O f f i c i a l s said the 26,000 uninhabited
dwellings represented the equivalent of an entire mid-size American city being
wiped out.
To be sure, federal agencies across the board have attracted rave reviews
for providing emergency shelter, food and money to people whose l i v e s were
disrupted by the quake. Senior administration o f f i c i a l s Henry G. Cisneros,
secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Federico Pena, Transportation
Department secretary, and James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, were hailed as ''heroes'' at Thursday's Senate hearing for
rushing to Los Angeles and directing the government's response.
Federal o f f i c i a l s admitted that the f i r s t few days after such a massive
disaster are destined to be chaotic, regardless of t h e i r l e v e l of
preparedness.
(Optional add end)
S t i l l , concerns remain that federal disaster o f f i c i a l s are undercounting
the number of households rendered unlivable by the earthquake. Sen. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., said she told President Clinton on h i s v i s i t to Los Angeles
two days after the temblor that U.S. government estimates that 2,000 people
were knocked out of their homes needed to be multiplied ''times 10. ''
Current federal estimates of 26,000 uninhabitable homes i n the earthquake
area are much too low. Boxer said.
Cisneros acknowledged that the i n i t i a l estimates were f a r too low, and
said they could go even higher when damage to neighboring Ventura County and
the impact of aftershocks are factored i n .
Boxer contended that the Federal Emergency Management Agency i s closing
disaster assistance centers too quickly as the extent of the damage continues
to mount along with the number of c i t i z e n s without shelter. FEMA i s
considering consolidation of some of i t s 20 d i s a s t e r application centers and
14 mobile s i t e s which Boxer opposes.
" I don't point the finger of blame at anyone,'' Boxer said in an
interview. " I t ' s j u s t that nobody (in Washington) i s used to the scope of
Los Angeles or that part of the country.''

Farrakhan Suspends Top Aide for Anti-Semitic Remarks (Washn)
By Robert L. Jackson= (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON Chastened by expressions of disapproval from the
Congressional Black Caucus and the U.S. Senate, Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan suspended a top aide Thursday for making what he called
'*repugnant'' and '"mean-spirited
remarks about Jews.
But the controversial black leader modified his rebuke of Khalid Abdul
Muhammad by i n s i s t i n g : ' I stand by the truths that he spoke.'' He then
accused the Jewish Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and Vice President
Al Gore both of whom had c r i t i c i z e d Muhammad's remarks as anti-black.
Farrakhan's announcement at a news conference here came a day after the
Senate condemned the remarks in a unanimous resolution and the caucus publicly
backed away from a "sacred covenant'' of cooperation i t only recently had
entered with the Nation of Islam.
Farrakhan's move climaxed weeks of controversy that began Nov. 29 during a
speech at Keane College in New Jersey, when Muhammad referred to Jews as
""bloodsuckers of the black nation.•' He said they controlled government, the
news media and other black a c t i v i s t s . He also heaped insults on other persons
and groups, including Pope John Paul I I , whom he c a l l e d ""a cracker'' and
homosexuals.
The Anti-Defamation League called attention to the comments and condemned
Farrakhan in a full-page ad in The New York Times.
Farrakhan explained his action against Muhammad by saying: ""In that
instance, he was not representing us. He was representing himself. I found the
speech ... repugnant, malicious, mean-spirited and spoken i n mockery of
individuals and people, which i s against the s p i r i t of Islam.'•
He added: "'While I stand by the truths that he spoke, I must condemn in
the strongest terms the manner in which those truths were represented.'
The black Muslim a c t i v i s t said he had relieved Muhammad of his duties
' u n t i l he demonstrates that he i s w i l l i n g to conform to the manner of
representing Allah and the honorable E l i j a h Muhammad (founder of the Nation
of Islam.)'•
Farrakhan said he remained convinced, however, that the Anti-Defamation
League was prejudiced against blacks and was trying to destroy him and his
Nation of Islam by publicizing the speech. He called the Jewish organization
"self-centered, bigoted and malicious,'' adding that Gore was conspiring with
i t against black people as part of "* racism at the highest levels of
government.''
11
(Optional add end)
Gore had c r i t i c i z e d Muhammad's remarks as ""the v i l e s t kind of racism,''
t e l l i n g the United Jewish Appeal that ""America i s a tolerant country, but we
should not tolerate hatred and racism.''
Abraham Foxman, the head of the Anti-Defamation League, rejected Thursday
any characterization of his group as anti-black. He said Farrakhan's comments
about the organization were an example of "double-think and hate.''
Farrakhan's organization i s a s p l i n t e r group based in New York that grew
out of the 1960s movement given prominence by the late Malcolm X. I t traces
i t s roots to the black pride and black nationalism that swept Africa after
World War I I . Long considered highly controversial because of his aggressive
rhetoric, Farrakhan has recently demonstrated some desire for acceptance by
mainstream blacks.

I s r a e l , Syria Peace Talks Back on Track (Washn)
By Norman Kempster= (c) 1994, Los Angeles Times=
WASHINGTON Ending a 15-month deep freeze, I s r a e l i and Syrian peace
negotiators have regained some lost momentum during their l a t e s t two-week
round of peace talks, which ended Thursday, I s r a e l i Ambassador Itamar
Rabinovich said.
He likened the new attitude to the one that produced the only significant
progress the two sides have made an October 1992 agreement on four of five
a r t i c l e s of a draft peace pact.
Despite an improvement in attitude, however, a senior I s r a e l i o f f i c i a l
said there were no breakthroughs on the key issues of I s r a e l i withdrawal from
the occupied Golan Heights and the nature of peace between the two bitter
antagonists.
The o f f i c i a l said that higher-level talks, perhaps between I s r a e l i Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Syrian President Hafez Assad, w i l l be required to
break the impasse.
State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States suggested a
two-week recess in the negotiations so the delegations could confer with their
governments. He said the talks would resume Feb. 15.
Following the format established at the Madrid Peace Conference in 1991,
I s r a e l conducts separate but simultaneous negotiations in Washington with
Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians.
But the focus of the Washington talks i s e n t i r e l y on the I s r a e l - S y r i a
track because I s r a e l and the Palestine Liberation Organization are engaged in
higher level meetings elsewhere.
I s r a e l and Jordan already have completed a draft peace treaty, although
Jordan refused to sign i t u n t i l more progress i s recorded on the other tracks
and Lebanon follows Syria's lead.
The I s r a e l i o f f i c i a l said Rabinovich, I s r a e l ' s chief negotiator, and
Syria's chief delegate, Mowaffak A l l a f , met for about 20 hours during this
round of t a l k s . The contact was t h e i r f i r s t in five months.
(Optional add
end)
Unlike e a r l i e r rounds, only delegation chiefs participated. By agreement,
the negotiators did not issue daily communiques as they have i n the past. Only
I s r a e l conducted an end-of-the-round briefing for reporters.
The I s r a e l i o f f i c i a l said Rabinovich assured A l l a f that I s r a e l i s prepared
to withdraw from most of the Golan Heights which I s r a e l seized from Syria in
the 1967 Middle East war as part of a peace settlement. But the o f f i c i a l said
I s r a e l i s demanding steps to compensate for the loss of the the security
afforded by holding the high ground between the two countries.
"The Syrians have to make up for the security value of the t e r r i t o r y so
the conclusion of peace between I s r a e l and Syria does not detract one iota
from I s r a e l i security,'' the o f f i c i a l said.

Ukraine Half-Heartedly Agrees to Scrap 200 Nuclear Warheads (Kiev)
By Mary Mycio= Special to the Los Angeles Times=
KIEV, Ukraine Parliament gave t a c i t approval Thursday for this country to
begin scrapping 200 of i t s more than 1,500 nuclear warheads, as part of a deal
struck l a s t month in Moscow. But lawmakers refused to declare Ukraine a
non-nuclear state, as the United States, Russia and their own president have
demanded.
Further, the resolution on nuclear arms, passed by 260 of the 296 Ukranian
lawmakers, was so vaguely crafted and hinged on such legal t e c h n i c a l i t i e s that
many deputies could not say what i t s effect would be. " I have no idea what we
voted f o r , ' said l e g i s l a t o r Ihor Dercacz.
Turning haziness into an advantage, a top government o f f i c i a l said
President Leonid M. Kravchuk w i l l interpret the measure as a green light to
begin transferring the f i r s t 200 weapons to Russia in return for fuel for
Ukrainian nuclear power plants. "We are going ahead with disarmament, the
o f f i c i a l said. " I can't see anything that can get in the way now.••
During President Clinton's v i s i t to Moscow in January, Clinton, Kravchuk
and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin signed an agreement committing Ukraine
to give up i t s nuclear weapons in seven years in exchange for American
economic aid, security guarantees and nuclear fuel. But the conservative
Parliament has, so far, proven ambivalent about whether giving up the world's
third-largest nuclear arsenal would leave Ukraine defenseless against possible
Russian aggression.

11
(Optional Add
End)
Last November, Parliament approved the START 1 disarmament treaty in
principle but said i t applied to less than half of the 176 nuclear-tipped
strategic missiles on Ukrainian s o i l . Lawmakers then added tough conditions
including security guarantees and disarmament aid that made the treaty
meaningless.
Kravchuk and his government told Parliament on Thursday that the deal
struck in Moscow s a t i s f i e s most of those conditions and Ukraine w i l l become a
pariah nation, i f i t refuses to sign. **To be l e f t by oneself in the
international community, even i f you think you are right, i s a losing game, '
Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko said.
Parliament also refused to approve the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, a move that could i r r i t a t e the West. Lawmakers fear that, i f they
renounce a l l nuclear weapons, they would then f o r f e i t the right to demand
compensation for warheads they hand over. '"Ukraine should approve the
Non-Proliferation Treaty only i f the United States and Russia e x p l i c i t l y
recognize i t s rights,*' said Yuri I . Kostenko, a key lawmaker.

have done today is turn their backs on universal

Despite the depth of business opposition to the
Ciinton plan, there wez-e signs yesterday that the
ousiness cemmunity was hardly of one mind.
Chamber officials had planned to reiterate their
support of an employer mandate in yesterday's
•.estimony, and only quibble about the size of
employer contifbutions, acco^ing to an advance text
lelivered to the Ways and Means Committee.
Patricelli and Grant declinedtosay why tbe
rroup changed its stand. An editorial in yesterday's
Vail Street Journal ndiculed the chamber for going
long vrith the White House.
Meanwhile, some companies whose chief
xecutives sit on the Business Roundtable issued
ress releases emicizijig the group for siding with

[otors. Ford and Bethlehem Steel.

•idea of an employer mandate, or gcvernirien:
requirement tnat employers help pay for their
employees' health covei-age.
White House officials beiieve the employer
mandate is the oniy way to pay for the president's
goal of universal coverage.
But The ehanbei appeai-ed to reverse itself
jterday, blasting the adminisu-ation proposal and
suggesting it would no longer accept a mandate in
any form.
Robert E. Patricelli. a chamber official, said at a
House Way-; and Means Ccmmittee heanng that the
White House plan "proposes such a burden of high
employer premium cotttributions, rich benefits and
countei-Droductive regulation ... that we believe that
it can't even be used as a starting point.''
Cari N Gi-ant, a chamber ^dce president, said
later that his group uo longer supports an employer
man date. "We'd like to see univetsal coverage if we
can affoid it. but •• haven't been able to come up
•e
'
with a way ':f rnancing it that we can support," he
said.
Wednesday, the Business Roundtable. which
represents 200 of the nation's largest companies,
issued a similar broadside against the Clinton plan,
.md it embi aced the rival Cooper-Breaux plan. The
Cooper-Breaux proposal ia much more modest tban

"The cbambsr's ^.ews have taken an un.fC'itur.iite

that the White House's long courtship of big
business has thus far been for nought
For example, General Motors issued a thi-eesentence statement that said the company did not
support the Business Roundtable's decision and
believed "it is more appropnate to work for a broad
consensus around a workable plan" But it did not
mention the president's proposal.
This came despite the fact that John F. Smith
Jr., the General Motors chairman, was seated beside
Hillary Rodham Qinton, a lead architect ofthe
administration plan, during last week's State ofthe
Union address in a move intended to woo his
support
"He was sitting there for a reason," David
Gergen. the White House counselor, said

Cl'nton announced his decision just one week
after the Senate voted 62-38 for a nonbinding- "seise
of the Senate' resolution that urged the
administration to lift the baa Kerry joined Sen.
John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who spent
six years as a pr.soner of v/ar in Vietnam, as the
chief sponsors ofthe Senate resolution. Clintoij
offered "a special word of thanks'' to Ker ry and
praised Kerry and McCain for "your leadership and
your- steadfastness.''
Keny later hailed Ginton's actions, saying tbe
move "begin? the final chapter of the war..".. It
doesn't end tht story, but it enhances the process of
gaining accountability." Sen. Robert Keirey, a
Democrat from Nebraska wbo won the Medal of
Honor and lost pait of a leg in the war, joined Kerry
at Clinton's announcement <ind hugged the president
afterward.
The public has been found to narrcwiy favor
Clinton's actions. A poll taken for The New York
Times and CBS News in mid-January showed that
J6 percent ofthe i .l46 adults polled thought the

Families of POW-MIAs in Southeast Asia, said the
United State.' has now lost the leverage it needs to
ersure Vietnamese coopcratice in the search for
missing rr.2r. "They've got their money, they car
ca:* ier-s. Now they dor.'t. have to answer to
anybody." Dur.r said.
And Sen. Roh^it Dole, the Rtpubiican leader
from Ha-.isas who was severely wounded during
World War I I . called Clinton's action "the wrong
decisv,:: at the wrong time for the wrong reasons."
"Many believe Vietnam is not being fully
forthcoming. But why should they'.'" Dole said.
"Wniie gcrig through the motions on POW-MIAs,
Vietnam niessed accurately that the administration
would give them what they wanted."
But in many ways. Cimton's supportei-s said, the
Wnite House was only bowing to reality. US and
or.her Westin toui.ists now regularly visit Vietnam;
US militaiy officials are allowed to roam through the
(•ountr.-r-ide unaccompanied by Vietnamese escoits;
and the Japanese and other US economic
competitors have begun to cash in on the pent-up
Vielnamese demand for foreign goods and sennces.
US films want to join with the Vietnamese in drilling
for oil and gas, rebuilding their inftastructure and
creating a modern telecommunications system.
NeveiTheless, Clmton insisted that he had "no
idea' of the economic benefits at stake. " I wanted to
make sui-? that ihe trade questions did not enter into
this decision.... I never bad a briefing on it and we
never had a discussion about it. I thought it was very
imponant that that not be a part of this decision."
Clinton said the United States retained leverage,
and warned the Vietnamese that "nothing is
hreversible if the cooperation ceases.''
Clinton, who took steps to avoid the draft and
joined antiwar protests, said he had not wavered on
the decision for fear of being branded as soft on the
Vietnamese.
He said members of his generation, "whether
they wei* in Vietnam or not," knew many who
seized and nied ther-e and shared a commitment to
obtain the "fullest possible accounting" of missing
US servicemen.
Clioton. however, went out of his way to praise
Sen. John V. Keny, the Demociat fi-om

Vietnam and decorated for bravery, and other
Vietnam veterans ».'• Congi-ess who have worked on
the issue V' rive the president political cover.
United States should end its embargo; 40 peitent of
therespondentswanted the embargo maintained.
A senior White House official said the many
meetings or. the question ofthe embargo were
weighted witb emotion. White House aides, briefing
reporter s yesterday, said Clinton had embraced a
unanimous conclusion of his top advisers, but
another official said there was senous discussion
both for and against the embargo.
Before announcing the decision, Clinton met with
leaders of veterans groups, including several that
r emained opposed to his action. A senior official
dismissed the reports of some veterans groups that
Americans are still being held prisoner in Vietnam.
"Nearly 100 reported live sightings have been
investigated on the ground in Vietnam since 1991,
and none has produced evidence tbat an Ameiican
POW is today held captive in Vietnam, the official

didn't bring a diff cult chapter in Amencan history to
a ciose.
Though, the pres'lriert's step will be widely hailed
as a symbolic end to the Vietnam war, the t;mh is
that Vietnam, ecen ^-0 decades later, is the war that
will not go awa).
' It will not go away for' Clint or. who angled to

It will not go away for tbe families oi tne more

•.vho have lived with rising and clashing hopes for
year-s. nor for the survivors ofthe 53,000 Ainericans
killed in the war, nor even for the 2.S milhon who
served in Vietnam and returned alive.
The anguish, the recriminations and the anger of
rhe Vietnam war - fealed anew tns week as the
preoidents ar. nouncement approached - ar e witb us
still.
'W e haven't seen that in any previcus war. because we haven't lost any previcus war/' says Alan
Bn'nkiey, a Columbia University historian.
The war's end has been proclaimed many times,
first with the Nixon administration's signing ofa
peace agreement with Hanoi, then with the hurned
departure of Americar. hellcopte?? from the Saigon
embassy compound in 1^75. Ther three year-s ago,
-jommentators, including this cportcr, conieuured
that the Vietnam syndrome hadfceenexoicised by
the victory in Iraq.
And now -.-ome fre-.h uecUrations rhat the war in
Vietnam has again reached a symbolic conclusion.
But cf all the lessons cf Vcrram, per-naps the
most jan ing 1 that a symbol can't end a war-, espe5
c'ally a war that preyed on the nation's conscience
and memory the way Vietnam did - and whicn itself

'Wars rarely erd gracefully, and their impact is
almost always felt a5 long as the generation that
fought the war is alive. The Civil War generation a;
lected American politics - and shaped American cuy
ture - thr ough the end of the 19th centuiy. The
memories of World Wav I and disillusionment wi'.h
the war'? results were responsible in part for the r.s-;
of Hit!c-r in Gennany.
But this war has lingered in a special way. F.-..the generation that fought or avoided it, the war s
never- far from the eurface, even if its extraordinary
immediacy is a mystery to those who fought in tho

•We still have individuals suffering long-term hcaii-.

But Rep. Duncan Hunter of Califoiwa said the
number of Border Patr ol agent - is stiU too low. To
secure the border, he estimated, at least 10,000
agent;'; would be needed.
Meissner dismissed Hunter's estimate as "far too
many." Rathe*- than ruly on number-s of agents,
Meissner said, she hopes to use reorganization and
technology to fight illegal immigration.
The INS hopes to depori a total of up to 20.000
foreign,ers convicted of crimes each year from five
targeted states: Califomia, Texas, New Yor k,
Florida and niinois.
The agency also plans to prosecute more
employers who hire illegal immigrants, and wants to
add magnetic strips to work authorization cards that
would make it more difficult to fake them.
At the same time, Meissner said, the INS will
spend almost $100 million of the $368 million
package to help revamp the process of granting
asylum and natui-alizaticn.
To speed up the processing of asylum requests,
the INS would double the number of officers and
judges handling claims. To belp immigrants to
become US citizens, the INS would work w'th
community groups to "lessen the intimidation of che
current pr-ocess."
Latin groups pr aised Reno for reaching out tc

WASHINGTON - AttotTiey Gener al Janet Reno
introduced a $368 million proposal yesterday to
combat illegal immigration by fuither securing the
Mexican border, deporting ft:.regr,pi-s convicted of
crimes aliens more quickly and cracking down on
employers of illegal worker-s.
Funding for tbe two-year plan has been included
in the budget President Clinton vrill present to
Congr-ess next week. Jt would significantly boost the
budget of the Immigration and Naturalization
Seivice from $1.6 billion in fiscal year-1993 to 52.1
billion in 1995.
Reno announced the plan together- with the INS
commissioner, Doris Meissner. and several
California lawmakers who expressed delight that it
will target the El Paso ar.d San Diego areas, where
5o percent of illegal aliens are arrested.
'We want to stop the revolving door."' Reno said.
To help prevent Mexicans from crossing the
bor der, the administration is proposing to add 1,010
Border Patrol agents to the cuirent for-ce of 3,461 by
the end of 1995. The INS would hire 500 new agents
and i eassign another 510 who ai e now doing desk
work.
The first major batch of agents, about 400, would
be assigned to The San Diego area, which wouid aiso
get new lighting and fencing. Agents in that, area
would be given more sophisticated equipment to help
catch aliens, and agents would begin fingerprinting
illegal crossers to monitor repeat offenders.

GLOBb." STAn '
Scientists and medica! ethicists arc bitterly
dhhdec ovei a clinical n-iai in Colorado in -.vhich half
of a gicup of 40 patients wth Parkinson's dist-aet
vdll undergo a "sham"' surgical procedure that
involves cutting nvo holes in the skull, even though
thoy wll get no benefit from the surgc-iy.
The other 20 patients will get zeal nu-gery. ic
which needles will be inseitcd through the holes in
the skull so that fetal tissue can be injected -into tha
brain. Thc hope paitially supported by pi er'ous
research, is that the transplanted tissue will replace
a ciucial brain chemical that is deficient in patients
with Parkinson's disease.
The study, expected to begin socn, is so
controvei-slal that even medical ethicists who often
see eye to eye hotly disagree.
George Annas, director of the iaw. medicine and
ethics program at the Boston University School of
Medicine, says that as iong as the surgeiy is
i-elatively safe and the patients know they have a 3050 chance of receiving the tissue, "it's not only OK.
It's good they ai e doing it,
"Not oniy is it ethical tc do it this way, it's
probably unethical to do it any other way. I am a big
believer in randomized, clinical tnals," Annas said.
'They are the only way to get valid conclusions as to
whether a therapy is better." •
But Arthur Caplan. director of the Center for
Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota,
says he is skeptical about whether "it is necessary to
go througb the sham procedure to get adequate
controls.... In this case, it seems to me that if we
arc going to bore large holes in people's heads, we
have gone too far to pursue scientific accuracy and
not far enough to respect the dignity of the subject."
In research with new dnigs, it is nonnal practice
to aak patients to agree in advance either to take the
drug or a placebo, without their knowing which they
-criil get. This allows researchers to assess tbe
treatment's effectiveness.
But human trials involving sham, surgevy are
extremely rare because of ethical concerns about
subjecting patients to invasive procedures that
cannot possibly help them, even though research
with clcarcut results might benefit society. Doctors
inteniewed yesterday could not recall any sham
surgery studies in recent decades, notirg thst thfe?

postage stamps - is net very dangerous. Tne
potential danger, he said, comes only with the
insertion of the needles into the brain, which will not
be done in the control patients.
Div J. Wiiliam Langston, president ofthe
Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale, Calif., praised
the trial as "daring" and "first-class science."
Noting that Fr eed's team will work wth
researchers h om Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center in New York and Noith Shore University
Hospital on Long Island, Langston said the "double
Wind" study - with neither patients nor' doctors
'-mowing who gut the i-eal surgery - "is the only way
to get a good answer on thia. I am not sure I would
have had the neive to do this myself. These people
willfly2,000 miles and wont know if they got the
transplanter not."
Langston said a larger concern is whether the
Colorado study is premature. If its results are
negative, he said, "people will conclude
transplantation itself doesn't work."
Dr. Hich aid Penn, a neurosurgeon at Rush
Presbyteiian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview that the sham surgeiy
is outrageous. He acknowledged that the
government did not fund his own resea:ch but said
he found sham surgeiy objectionable "before we
oven put in a r-'ant."
a.-e other ways to compare treatment involving
surgery to nonsurgical care.
Several yeai-s ago. for instance, researchers
designed a tnal tc see if surgeiy removing plaque
from arteries in the neck reduced the risk of stroke.
Iiistead of using sham surgeiy on some patients,
doctors compared surgical patients to those getting
good nonsurgical treatment.
Ir. the Colorado study, some ethicists say the
•• takes are er.jreciaily high because this is the fu-st
'
federally fan ded expariment using fetal tissue since
Prerdent CVnton lifted afive-year-oldban on such
reseai-ch.
Last month, the government awarded $3.9
million over tour years to researchei-s from the
Univei sity of Colorado Health Sciences Center who
had used private funds for fetal transplants in
Parkinsons patienrs wbile federal funds were
unavailable.
In today's issue cf the journal Science,
researchers, including some who lost out on the f i-st
round of government-sponsored fetal transplant
rundirg. express concern about the sham surgeiy.
-.vith one neurosurgeon calling it "outrageous."
Sciemists are also worried that if the Colorado
experiment shows fetal transplant surgeiy does not
work, federal money for this kind of research will
diy up, although the acting head ofthe National
Institute on Neurological Diseases and Stroke,
Patricia Grady, yesterday denied that would bc the
case.
.According to Dr. Curt Freed, a lead researcher
and professor- of medicine and phamacology at the
University of Colorado, none of the patients in his
study will know who '.•eceived the implants.
Because all patients wil! be awake during the
procedures, which will be done under local
anesthesia, doctors will cany on similar
conversations during all oper-ations and will try to
make sur e all procedures take the same amount of
time, he added.
The patients will be followed by doctors in New
York whe wii! not know which patients got which
surgery. Freed said that patients-who get the sham
surgeiy will be offer ed the real surgery a year- later.
Freed defended the study design, noting this
kind of study "is ^vbere pr ogi-ess in medical researth
comes from.''
He added that simply drilling holes in the skull one on each sice, witn each hole about the size of two

Grady, ofthe neurology institute, noted that the
study was reviewed by ethicists onreviewboards at
aH three medical centei-s before it received federal
approval.
But John Sladek Jr., chairman of the
: euroscience depaitment at Chicago Medical School,
said he was "bewildered as to how a human
institutional review committee would approve tbis,"
and he said he was troubled by i t
Dr. Marcia Angela, executive editor of the New
England Jouinal of Medicine, added that if the
Colorado expenments have "no therapeutic benedt
for rh? participating patients, just forresearch,I
third-: it's wrong."
Others had even harsher- words. Dr. Michael
Grodin, director of medical ethics at the Boston
Unjver-sity School of Medicine, added, ^Who in his
right mir.d would sign up for a study where he would
have a . . . hole put in his head and no fetaltissueput
in?
"The only people who would sign up are those
who weren't given information about the study, or
who were given infomation and didnt hear it cr
under stand it, or who were fantasizing that it can't
really be that it wouid be the placebo, or sham."

Arafta seen
lookmg to Jordan
By Adam Fe '.r..:s,
PLO chaifman Yassic Aj-afat '.-jio expr-essed
\rjlingness to accept a Paies'im'fm suit fov just "a
single day" as a smbolic .-tet before joining a
confederation with J ord-in, Fore^n Minister Shimon
Peres of Israel said yesterday in Boston.
While Peres went on to say it was premature to
discuss the nature of a "permanent" Palestinian
homeland, Arafat's purpoitcd remarks aie
significant because they come in the context of
intensive Isradi-PLO talks over initial self-rule in
the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
Peres first repoited Arafat's comments favoring
a confederation eariier this week. The foreign
minister elaborated on that dunng a breakfast
meeting here with local Jewish leaders and
journalists.
•'He says that the PLO has decided that it will go
for a confeder-ation with Jordan, ard not a separate
Palestinian state," Per es said of Arafat. 'Tt is P-ue
that when he is saying a confederation, he says he
wc-.ild like to have, for- a single day, two states and
then unite tbem. '
If that is indeed the Palestine Liberation
Organization's goal - and Arafat so far- has not
disavowed Peres' comments - it would indicate the
PLO was moving toward vhe "Jordanian option'' long
supported by the United States and Israel's Labor
Party. Many Isincl's, fearing a Palestinian state
could he used to launch attacks against them, ar-e
more trusting cf Jordan ard receptive to the (dea of
a confederation.
Jordan ruled th.e West Bank until iSG7. In 1.972.
Kmg Hussein proposed a union with the West Bark
hut wasiebuffed by Palestinian r.ationsiists. At
present, Hussein says be does not favor- a
corfedc-i ation and has asked Arsfatto "dv-p this
e.x-prcss'lon f-om lus lexicon and ahsoiutely not to
discuss it w'th me."
Even it'a confederation wove tc r.xlve. many
issues would have to be »-.>so!ved - ner, as whether
ther-e wouid be one capital o-- two, which l-aders
would oversee which populations,, ann '.vho would
shape domesb'c ard foreign poiicv. It couid alsc put
the Palestinians, who already constitute a majority
of Jordanians, in posilion to assume power- over the
joint s^ate.
In Jerusalem, some Palestinian leaders said
yesterday there bad been no change n theii desir-e
:
1
:
to build an independent state, rotwithstar.dmg
Arafat's reported remarks. Others speculated that.
Feres and Arafat were cooperating tc moiiify the
Israeli public's fear of a Palestinian state.
"Statehood is an expression of self-determination
which is a Palestinian right that belongs to the
Palestinian natioii and cannot be withheld or
bestowed at will," Hanan Ashrawi, former
spokeswoman for- the Palestinian delegation to the
peace talks, said in a phone interview. "And
confederation . . . presupposes statehood. They are
not mutually exclusive."
Peres confirmed in Boston yesterday that r.t vrii:
meet again with Arafat next Monday in Cairo r.o try
to i-esolve differ ences about the Palestinian takeover
of Gaia and Jericho. Wednesday, in a speech at
Brandeis University, Penis said he expected a final
pact with the PLO to be implemented by year's end.
Ask?d yesterday whether' that prediction mos red
with Prime Minister Yitshak Rabin's mor-e cau ti CMS
view that "jnly a miracle'' would bring about an
agreement during next week's bargaining, Peres
replied that it did. He eaid there was considcraole
time bEtwsen next week and the end of the year-,
then added, "Miracle is part of our reality."
Per es made several appearances around Boston
yesterasy. including a visit to'the John F. Kennedy
Library ard address at Haivard University. At
almost every stop, he tried to drive home seve: al
pcir's. that American Jews should not wony about
Isnicl negotiating away any part of Jerusalem; that
there is cause for cautious optimism about the ta' ks
with the Palestinians, the Syrians and. especially. :'r ••:
Joidanians; arid that the Labor government was
"making a mor al choice" and r.ot just conducting a
political exercise in striving to make peace.
" I feel that we negotiate with ourselves not less
than we are regobating with the Palestinians.''
Pe-;.' said at the Four- Seasons Hotel yesterday
morr.iiig. ''And the negotiations that wc conduct wr.n
oui-selves are to enable us to retum to Jewish
tr-adu-'on, a tracii'-ion that is 4.000 ycai'S old anu that
never included an attempt to dominate another
people. A'e never- did it in the past and we don't w^rt
to do it m the futu'-e."
