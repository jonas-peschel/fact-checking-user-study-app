Understanding the Federal Budget
The federal budget is more than just a set of numbers. It expresses the policy priorities of our nation — and is a critical part of our fiscal and economic future.
The federal budget reflects our elected leaders’ decisions on how to tax and spend, to borrow and lend, and to consume and invest. Those decisions define the size of the federal government and its role in the national economy.
Federal Spending
In 2024, total federal spending was $6.8 trillion — nearly 25 percent of the size of our economy and $20,100 for each person living in the United States. That spending can be divided into three categories.
1) Mandatory Spending
Programs governed by provisions of permanent law are referred to as “mandatory.” Because mandatory programs do not require annual approval, such spending is essentially on “autopilot” unless policymakers change the underlying laws governing the program.
Many of the programs that provide benefits to individuals are classified as mandatory spending, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Those programs are also often referred to as "entitlements" because individuals who meet the programs’ eligibility requirements are "entitled" to benefits.
Mandatory spending covers programs in six major areas:
- Major Health Programs has four components: Medicare (for seniors and disabled people); Medicaid (generally for lower-income beneficiaries); premium tax credits and related spending (for low- and moderate-income people); and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP, for low-income children and parents).
- Social Security provides payments to retired and disabled workers, as well as to their spouses, dependent children, and survivors.
- Income Security Programs make payments to individuals based on their income through programs including: earned income, child, and other tax credits (the portion of such credits for the working poor that exceed their income are recorded as outlays in the budget); the the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as food stamps); Supplemental Security Income (payments to disabled children and adults with limited incomes); unemployment compensation (time-limited payments for people who become unemployed); family support and foster care; and child nutrition.
- Veterans’ Programs that provide pensions, income support, and other benefits for those who previously served in the military
- Federal Retirement Programs for federal civilian and military retirees.
- Other Programs consist of a range of activities, including agricultural support, student loan subsidies, and deposit insurance.
The laws governing mandatory programs do not provide specific funding levels. Instead, they specify who is eligible for benefits as well as the type and level of benefits to be distributed. For example, the unemployment insurance program has eligibility criteria regarding employment status, availability to work, and past income that, once met, allow an individual to receive a certain level of benefits. Total federal spending on the program depends on the number of people who file for unemployment, not on a fixed amount of funding set by lawmakers.
The term "mandatory" doesn’t mean that lawmakers are powerless to alter this spending. At any time, elected officials can adjust the eligibility criteria and benefit formulas that determine spending on mandatory programs, as they did with Social Security in 1983. However, if Congress and the President take no action, the current formulas and criteria for benefits generally remain in place year after year, and the spending flows as specified by law, without interruption.
Over time, federal spending for mandatory programs has increased more quickly than most other programs — primarily because of the growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. In the early 1970s, around 40 percent of the federal budget was spent on mandatory programs, while the rest funded an array of appropriated funding and net interest. CBO estimates that around 60 percent of federal spending currently goes to mandatory programs.
2) Discretionary Spending
Discretionary spending is determined on an annual basis by Congress and the President through the appropriations process. As opposed to the "automatic" nature of mandatory spending, discretionary spending must be approved each fiscal year.
Defense spending represents nearly half of total discretionary spending. Other major activities funded through appropriations include homeland security, education, transportation, research, food safety, science and space programs, disaster assistance, environmental protection, public housing, and federal law enforcement.
In the 1960s, about two-thirds of total federal spending went to fund discretionary programs. In 2024, discretionary spending was just 27 percent of the budget. Over the next decade, it is projected to decrease to a historically low level relative to the size of the national economy.
3) Net Interest
The third major category of spending is interest on the national debt. Interest rates have been higher for the past couple of years due to the rise in inflation and actions by the Federal Reserve. Driven by those rates and the accumulation of federal debt, interest costs have become the fastest-growing “program” in the federal budget — exceeding the rate of growth of both Social Security and Medicare.
Currently, the United States spends more than $2.6 billion every day on interest payments. Next year, interest as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) will exceed its post-World War II high of 3.2 percent. Over the next 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that interest costs will total $13.8 trillion, and looking further ahead, CBO projects that net interest costs will grow from 13 percent of the budget in 2024 to 23 percent in 2054.
Federal Revenues
In 2024, total federal receipts were $4.9 trillion, about 17 percent of GDP. The largest sources of federal revenues are individual income and payroll taxes, followed by corporate income taxes, customs duties, and excise taxes.
Who Pays Taxes
To evaluate whether the tax system is fair or not, it is important to look comprehensively at all of the taxes that people pay, not just one particular form of taxation.
For example, while it is true that many lower earners pay little or no individual federal income tax, there are many other kinds of taxes that apply to such individuals. In fact, taxpayers whose incomes are in the bottom 90 percent of all incomes pay, on average, more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. At the other end of the spectrum, high-income Americans receive a significant amount of their income from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at lower rates than wages and salaries. However, wealthier taxpayers also face higher tax rates on their other income and indirectly bear a greater share of the corporate income tax, which significantly raises their overall effective tax rates. In the aggregate, our federal tax system is structured to be generally progressive, with higher-income taxpayers paying a larger share of their income in taxes.
Tax Expenditures
The income tax code contains many provisions that allow individual and corporate taxpayers to effectively reduce their tax bills. Such special provisions — deductions, exemptions, deferrals, exclusions, credits, and preferential rates — are known as “tax expenditures.” In 2024 tax expenditures totaled nearly $1.9 trillion. That amount equals about 65 percent of the revenues that the federal government actually collected in income taxes and exceeds what was spent by any single agency or spending program, including Social Security and the Department of Defense.
Just eight tax expenditures amounted to $1.3 trillion in 2024 — about two thirds of the cost of all tax expenditures.
Tax expenditures are often referred to as "spending in disguise," because lawmakers use the tax code to direct subsidies to specific constituencies and activities. Policymakers also use tax expenditures to influence consumer and business behavior. The mortgage interest deduction, for example, encourages taxpayers to buy homes instead of renting. Similarly, depreciation provisions for businesses encourage new purchases of equipment. In addition, because tax expenditures subsidize "favored" activities, they can distort economic decisions in ways that reduce the productivity of our economy.
Tax expenditures generally receive less scrutiny than spending programs. Most do not need annual review and approval, and therefore often remain in place for many years. With few opportunities for review and consideration, they are harder to control and less transparent than line-item spending programs. Many tax expenditures are also more valuable for people at higher marginal tax rates, so the benefits of tax expenditures often skew toward those with higher incomes.
The Budget Process
Policymakers use the federal budget process to establish spending priorities and to determine who will pay for those activities. The formulation of the budget is an annual process that involves the Congress, the White House, and federal agencies.
Within the process, lawmakers do not approve one single budget — the federal budget comprises many separate documents and pieces of legislation.
Budget Process Reforms
The current budget process faces a number of challenges and is ill-suited for managing the nation’s long-term fiscal outlook. There are a range of potential reforms that could improve the budget process and fiscal outcomes.
While budget process reform alone cannot substitute for political agreement about fiscal policies and priorities, there are many reforms that would help encourage responsible budgeting and improve accountability. Areas of reforms include:
- Adding a long-term focus. The current budget process is focused on a 10-year “window” that Congress uses to measure the projected effect of lawmakers’ actions going forward. This window could be extended for a longer period, to better focus on key long-term drivers of our growing debt.
- Setting targets. Requiring Congress and the president to set medium- and long-term fiscal goals, then reporting annually on the progress they have made toward those objectives.
- Strengthening enforcement. Adding new or strengthening existing enforcement measures that would help policymakers stay on the path towards their budget targets. These reforms should be flexible enough to accommodate changing economic conditions and priorities, but, at the same time, be strong enough to establish and reinforce overall commitment to fiscal sustainability.
- Other reforms. There are a number of budget process reform options frequently discussed by policymakers, such as changing the congressional budget resolution into law or adopting a biennial budget process.
While the annual budget process would benefit from reform, there are fundamental problems caused by the lack of political will to make difficult choices. Without effective decision-making about fiscal tradeoffs, deficits are projected to rise to unsustainable levels in coming decades due to the aging of the population, rising healthcare costs, increasing interest costs, and insufficient revenues to meet existing commitments. Improving our fiscal condition over the long term will take political leadership from both parties.
