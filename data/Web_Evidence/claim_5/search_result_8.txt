he Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) 2020 will be held by the Consortium of National Law Universities on September 7. The law entrance exam was scheduled to be conducted on May 10 but was postponed several times due to the pandemic. Last year, CLAT was held on May 26 and the result was announced in June.
More recently the exam was scheduled to be held on August 22 but the same was postponed last week until further notice following a meeting by the executive committee of the Consortium of National Law Universities. It was stated that intrastate travel was posing a challenge for the aspirants in the COVID intensive states who would have to report to the designated centres to take the online test. As per the latest notice by the authorities, the exam will now be held on September 7.
CLAT is an entrance-level exam for admission to undergraduate and postgraduate law courses. The scores are used by the 22 NLUs across the country. This year, around 59 private universities and law schools have entered into an MoU with the Consortium of National Law Universities to admit students on the basis of their CLAT scores instead of holding separate entrance exams.
“The two hour exam will have altogether 150 questions instead of the earlier 200 questions; candidates will be tested on their legal acumen, logical and legal reasoning not on law per se as CLAT aspirants are not expected to have prior knowledge about the stream; in an effort to make the entrance exam relatively easy, comprehension-based questions will also be asked,” says Faizan Mustafa, vice chancellor, NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad
who, as the earlier president of the Consortium of National Law Universities was the key initiator of these modifications that were notified in 2019.
