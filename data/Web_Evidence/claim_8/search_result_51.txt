From The Reading List
New York Times: "Meet Young Joe Biden, the ‘Wild Stallion’" — "There’s a reason that a certain kind of journalist makes a quadrennial habit of reading 'What It Takes,' Richard Ben Cramer’s gonzo classic about the 1988 presidential primary. It’s catnip to prose snobs."
Financial Times: "Inside Joe Biden’s race of a lifetime" — "He has been trying to win the White House for more than 30 years. Can he beat Donald Trump in 2020?"
Slate: "When Joe Biden Was the Candidate of the Young" — "A little more than a week before Election Day 1972, readers of Wilmington, Delaware’s major newspapers were greeted with a series of advertisements from 29-year-old New Castle County Councilman Joseph R. Biden Jr. Biden was running for U.S. Senate against an older, much more established candidate, the two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Cale Boggs."
Politico: "55 Things You Need to Know About Joe Biden" — "Joe Biden’s life in politics has been marked from its inception by its seismographic lurching from success to setback. Victories were followed by unthinkable personal tragedy."
BBC: "Will Joe Biden's political record come back to haunt him?" — "But his last viable opponent, Bernie Sanders, is keen to highlight the former US vice-president's political baggage from a long career as a Washington insider - and tar him as out of touch with the mainstream of the modern Democratic party."
Politico: "Opinion: I Observed Joe Biden at Close Range for 20 Years. Here’s How He Wins—and Loses" — "Through my friendship with John Marttila, who ran Joe Biden’s first campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1972 and remained a close adviser until his death in 2018, I had many opportunities to be in Biden’s presence over the past 20 years, usually at fundraisers in Boston and holiday parties at the vice president’s residence."
Washington Post: "Trump said Biden ‘hurt God.’ Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith." — "When Pope Francis visited the United States in 2015, his welcomer-in-chief was then-Vice President Joe Biden."
