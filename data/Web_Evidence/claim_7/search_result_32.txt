Paula Denison [Catholics for Choice]

I am Polly Denison from Van Horne, Iowa, and I am a prochoice Catholic. Im here to say that Catholics can, in good conscience, support access to abortion and affirm that abortion can be a moral choice. Indeed, many of us do.Im here today as one of the majority of Catholics, in Iowa and across the country, who stand with Catholics for Choice. I come here to represent those voices and to speak in deep opposition to HJR 2004. The measures proposed in this bill are a violation of many of the core principles my Catholic faith teaches.Iowa is home to more than 480,000 Catholics, making up 15% of the states population. It is home to a whopping 15 Catholic Healthcare facilities and nearly 400 parishes.Decades of polling tells us that a solid majority of Catholics believe that abortion should be legal in the United States and six in 10 Catholics believe abortion can be a moral choice. And the Catholics in Iowa agree. Last winter I started to reclaim my faith. I was raised Catholic but struggled a great deal with the church hierarchys position on things like abortion, women's equality and marriage. Then, in the fall, I found a group called Catholics for Choice. I learned that I am a good Catholic because I question these positions, and because I follow my conscience. Because I follow my conscience even when it calls me to take a contrary view.Our church has taught us that we are obligated to follow our conscience and make moral and ethical decisions based on our own judgment. It's refreshing and enlightening. I am prochoice because of my Catholic faith, not in spite of it. The two are not in conflict.I have attached a letter from Catholics for Choice Acting President Sara Hutchinson Ratcliffe, emphasizing how important the idea of conscience is to Catholics like me.The Catechism states that a human being must always obey the certain judgment of his conscience. It is both a gift and a responsibility that we are called to always follow our conscience above all else and to respect the right of others to do the same. Please appreciate the breadth of Catholic opinion on these issues and dont be deceived by the Iowa Catholic Conference, their conservative allies and antichoice interest groups who claim to speak for all Iowans. Be assured, Catholics like me support access to the full range of reproductive health services. I urge you to reject HJR 2004 as a sign of your commitment to the moral autonomy of Iowans like me. It is the right thing to do.

The state of Iowa flag clearly states "OUR rights we will maintain" not some peoples, not certain people but OUR RIGHTS. Those public servants who are determined to strip Iowans of their rights are not only violating the public's trust but trampling on our constitution and our faith in government. It's not your job to legislate morality based on a radical fraction of our population's religious beliefs. You are not god and should not insert yourselves as his replacement.

If this amendment passes, the Iowa Constitution would no longer protect the right to end a pregnancy under any circumstance including when pregnancy is the result of rape or when the life of the pregnant person is in danger. No one wants to imagine being in that position, but the fact is that one in four women have had an abortionthat means we all know and love someone who has had to make this decision for her future and her family and that decision has been between the pregnant person and the doctor.Research has shown us that most Iowans approve of safe and legal abortion. Iowas constitution has strong privacy protections that ensure our right to personal freedomthis amendment would weaken those protections by opening the door for politicians to pass even more restrictions on healthcare for everyone. It also has the potential to prevent doctors from using their best medical judgment which jeopardizes the quality of healthcare a patient receives.It is unacceptable for any of us to not be able to make our own medical decisions. Our representatives should be protecting our rights, not restricting them.

I am very bipartisan but we cant allow men to choose for women and drive them into the dark times and have women dying and being forced to go out of state for something that is already a difficult choice most men in office most likely have had a women close them use this option and not realized it because its not something people widely announce please rethink your votes Kevin Miller

The biggest anxiety in the lives of many Iowan women is their right to reproductive healthcare. Access to treatments such as birth control and abortion are paramount to continuing healthy and safe lives in our communities.Everyone knows someone who has had an abortion, whether they know it or not. Because it is a difficult personal decision it is not spoken of often and many times not lived with guiltfree. But it is still a personal decision that should be made with a woman and her doctor.Family planning services are life or death for many women, particularly low income women, in the state of Iowa. No one wants an abortion; many times it is simply the lesser of two evils. Reproductive healthcare is a basic human right.Our representatives should protect our rights, not restrict them.

This proposed amendment is obscene and flagrantly unconstitutional. It will have huge impacts on Iowans, including medical programs (you think anyone will come to an Iowa school for an obstetrics and gynecology program if theyre forbidden from learning certain medical procedures?). This amendment is short sighted and dangerous and will impact poor people and people of color, who are not at all represented by this legislature. Republicans are assaulting our rights and this amendment needs to be shut down immediately. Iowa could not look more backwards to the rest of the nation.

The League of Women voters has a long history of defending the rights of women including the right to make decisions about her own body. Abortion have occured since ancient times and no law or regulation can stop it. What a law will do is make it difficult, dangerous and expensive especially for low income women. I would hope our legislators would find a better use of their time and energy in providing health, education and protection for all Iowans including the most vulnerable such as nursing home residents and the residents of the Glenwood Resource Center.

Why do we not TRUST the public enough to vote for themselves? At what point do citizen legislators know more than the rest of the general public and should make ALL decisions for us? To me this is an information issue. Legislators distrust the public with information because they dont believe they will make the decision they want. Iowans are highly educated, we have the highest high school graduation rate In the nation. If legislators would only allow for the public to know all of the pertinent information and allow both sides to present them that information, then allow them to make a truly informed decision on what is best for OUR state constitution.

I am a mom, a wife, a mother, and I'm currently nine months pregnant, and I strongly oppose this bill. Reproduction is deeply personal and private, and legislators have no place in decisions that belong between a woman and her partner, and a woman and her doctor. I am one of countless women who has found herself in the heartbreaking position of needing a medical abortion for a very wanted, and very planned pregnancy. I am thankful that my life and my fertility were preserved through medical intervention by my doctor, and that I've been able to go on and have these children. The bottom line here is that pregnancy planned or unplanned comes with serious health and financial risks for a woman and her family. Women are capable of weighing their moral obligations, the ethical considerations and for her self and for her existing and future children, the financial risks, and the health implications, and making decisions about reproduction privately and safely. Do not support this bill.

I am beyond concerned about the attempt to pass an Iowa constitutional amendment on the issue of a woman's right to choose an abortion. Does no one remember the desperate measures women went to to end an unwanted pregnancy? Is a woman who chooses an abortion a secondclass citizen? Rich women have always been able to travel to California or New York or Europe to obtain an abortion. If you are a woman of modest financial means, too bad for you if you choose an abortion? Please respect our Federal law that protects women AND doctors who choose an abortion! I am ashamed to be an Iowan when we happily limit unions, limit reproductive freedom rights, try to say felons can't vote even after serving their time unless fines & fees are totally paid, and pretend to support people in need living, breathing people doing the best they can while our legislature is more concerned with fetal rights. No one is being forced to have an abortion, that I know of now or at any time in my growing up years. They are making a choice that is their legal right.

A woman should have the right to choose whether or not she wants to be pregnant. This is largely a religious issue. The state of Iowa does not have the right to dictate religious views. Further, the state continues to try to block access to birth control for our poorest citizens.

42 years ago, on January 4th, I made the horrible choice to terminate the life of my baby. It was not my first choice, but it was one that was encouraged by family members, to save the family name. There has not been a single day since the decision was made and then followed through to action, that I have NOT regretted it. There was never a sense of relief, and in fact, it haunted me for decades. I was told by my loving parentsand I truly mean that it would never be brought up again and as far as they were concerned it never happened. But you see, it DID happen and I was an emotional mess. Hormones, and other physical trauma, along with guilt, and having to go without help, was eating me. No one wins in abortion. When a young lady walks into an abortion clinic, (or like me, U of I Hospital) there are two lives going through those doors, but only one leaves alive, and then she most likely is traumatized by her decision, and forever scarred. I know, I am one of those who made that decision. If I could talk to any young lady about this before hand to tell them the truth that they are carrying life in them, and that their own body will tell them after, that something traumatic is happening to them now because that life was drastically cut off, I would. I would love to tell every young lady that has made that choice, who still suffers, regrets and carries the guilt within them, that they are loved and they need counseling, I would. I would love them, but support them in getting the help they need.Abortion has created a whole new set of problems. Emotional trauma of the greatest magnitude. Why would anybody support killing a baby and destroying a young lady at the same time? Each time, I tell my story, I have someone reach out to me and tell me that they have carried this burden, shame, grief and hurt for years, decades and have never been able to talk about it, even with those closest to them. They are too afraid to reach out to anyone. Yet, our country stands behind this horrific choice? I want to know of someone who feels right about murder after they have committed it or encouraged it. I doubt I will find one. I honestly believe that my parents, too, regretted this decision, but were too afraid, ashamed to talk about it. Now that they are in the presence of the LORD, I know without a shadow of a doubt that would want me to be standing for life, and speaking out against abortion.

Dear Legislators, Governor, and Anyone Reading This:Antiabortion and prolife policy is just as draconian as Chinas one and twochild policies. If you are in favor of antiabortion and prolife policies, please reconsider. Taking away access to safe and legal abortion procedures is in spirit the same as the forced abortions and sterilizations that have occurred under Chinas one and twochild policies. Both are instances of the state overstepping and suppressing individual reproductive sovereignty, privacy, and choice. Forcing the impregnated to carry a pregnancy to term, regardless of circumstances or how they feel about the impregnator, is just as draconian as forcing an abortion on someone who wants a child. In the former, proponents cite religious faith and morality and in the latter China has cited population control. How would the proposed antiabortion constitutional amendment make Iowa like China? Such an amendment would turn us into a state that, like China, butts into personal reproductive decisions and takes away individual rights. Do we really want the state to become the 800pound gorilla making sure that the unwillingly impregnated stay restrained and pregnant in the name of the unborn and the faithbased, not evidencebased, agenda of one faction of their fellow citizenry? How would that faithbased faction of citizenry feel if the state imposed forced abortions on them because a populationcontrol faction had gained political power? Neither are hypothetical situations but have actually played out in different global states, including our nation. In our state of Iowa, we have a good middle ground of choice. Dont mess it up. Taking away choice in either direction on this is an attack on freedom.Instead of attempting to legislate one factions opinion down everyones throats, a more effective path might be to focus on creating a state where everyone has access to outstanding reproductive health care and where teenaged adopted children like Natalie Finn dont starve to death because the State has failed in its duties to the born.If you have publicly declared yourself prolife and antiabortion, there are ways to work towards reducing the number of abortions sought without relying on the state to impose your way on everyone. No, I do not mean legislating undue burdens on women and girls to restrict and deny access and generally make our lives more difficult. How about opening nonprofit daycares and paying the staff living wages? What about more support for women to work or not work as needed based on their health needs during pregnancy while still maintaining enough income to live on? What about addressing those vulnerable months postbirth where some people don't have the financial resources to take twelve weeks of unpaid family medical leave, if they even qualify for this. If your agenda is to protect mothers and the unborn, then focus your energies on creating policies that support people instead of slamming our hardwon women's rights. Remember that there is a difference between evangelism and coercion. Attempting to amend the Iowa Constitution as a groundwork for taking away access to safe and legal abortions goes too far into the realm of coercion.Sincerely,Sarah Singelee

As a woman who was born and raised in Iowa, I am insulted and disgusted to find out that we are still fighting for the right to do what we wish with our own bodies. I wasn't even alive when Roe v Wade occurred and yet I'm still forced to explain to people that this is my body so whether or not I get an abortion should be my choice. No one should have a say in what I do with my body, it is my decision. If you're still having trouble deciding if this is the right path, I ask you to consider how you would feel if the government told you that you can't have a procedure to remove a deadly tumor because it is considered living tissue.

There has been an endless war on women's rights. I oppose such legislation as it will not put an end to abortion. It will put an end to safe abortion.

We brought abortion out of the back alleys and into the physician's office.It is appalling to think we are still fighting for the right to choose. I think if we are to be fair then we should also be talking about men's reproductive rights. We could legislate the use of condoms and Viagra. Sounds nuts but it sounds nuts that women have to jump through hoops to attain a safe and legal abortion.

My name is Eric Schultz.When I was in my mother's womb, I had a twin pass away. Doctors watched me up until birth. In some ways, I should not have been born. By definition, I should be against abortion but I am not.My mother endured some of the worst pregnancy could offer. She was placed on bed rest for months of one of her pregnancy while my alcoholic father did not do anything to help and had to put up with bed sores and an awful csection that she says is a thousand times worse than a natural birth. I am incredibly thankful for her sacrifice to provide me and my sister life but (in my opinion) to have the government force that on somebody is beyond barbaric and the modern day equivalent of slavery/indentured servitude that only half the population has to suffer the consequences.Women are the only people who suffer the physical, bodily consequences of a mistake/making love/rape. And while female politicians, such as Sen. Amy Sinclair and Rep. Shannon Lundgren, like to swindle the population into thinking that women are "prolife", I would be remiss to not mention that women lawmakers (including Governor Kim Reynolds) voted against the Heartbeat Bill 13yeas24nays with one absent.It is apparent through research that Reynolds and the 12 other women in the legislator do not truly represent a majority of women's best interest. Most women have consistently demanded bodily autonomy as actual polling data (and not polls of what should happen with Roe) show more women in America have consistently voted for prochoice presidential candidates than not since right after Casey v Planned Parenthood (1992) proved this issue was not safe (https://cawp.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/resources/ggpresvote.pdf). The issue I have with letting this measure go to the voters is that men have the ability to decide what a woman does with her body. While I normally support men and women voting equally on issues, when medical/OBGYN organizations constantly oppose antiabortion bills while those in favor tend to be faithbased, I believe that it is in the best interest of the public that a truly conservative/limited government side with medically licensed and stay out of a woman's choice she makes with her doctor. Allowing men to have a say in women's health issues is the equivalent to letting southern whites in the 1800s decide whether or not slavery/Jim Crow Laws should be permitted; it literally is something that has zero effect on them. The best way to deal with this issue is to have the government stay clear of this issue and this amendment proposal fails to do so on a huge scale.In conclusion, I ask that you please consider extending a further a conservation with me. There are four representatives in particular that I specifically seek to speak with, in addition to my own representative (Wes Breckenridge) this coming Tuesday.

I am vehemently opposed to this resolution. Abortion is health careperiod. And as a certified nursemidwife who serves diverse patients in Waterloo, I understand intimately the need for patients to have access to this health care service. There is no other area of health care that is regulatedor interfered with to the extent that abortion is. I studied for seven years to specialize in women's health and for this reason know precisely how safe and necessary abortion is. How dare a politician think he or she knows more than I do, or know more than women who make this decision about their own body? I cannot think of a principle or tenet of our society more important than bodily autonomy. And for those that ask "what about the baby's autonomy"I implore you to reflect on the fact that your definition of life is not universal. As a Jewish person, for example, I believe that life starts at birth, and I respect and uphold my patients' own definitions. History teaches us that when abortion is made illegal, or prohibitively inaccessible, it still continuesjust unsafely. If this resolution passes, the blood of women who die from backalley abortions is on your hands. If you really wanted to eliminate abortion, you would invest in comprehensive sex education and in birth controlthe ONLY interventions proven to safely decrease abortion rates.

There is northing more sacred than LIFE itself and it deserves to be protected in every aspect by every person. The Iowa Legislature passed the 'Heartbeat Bill", a piece of legislation that was trendsetting and has since been duplicated by a number of other states. It gave a voice to the unborn who could not be put to death after their little heartbeat was detectable. The legislation was overturned by an opinion from the bench. How many little hearts will stop beating because of that opinion by a liberal judge who craved power and notoriety?To the Iowa Legislature: please protect LIFE and allow those tiny little hearts to keep beating.

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen. A woman's choice for an abortion is not or has ever been your choice, nor do you have the right to govern over that choice for her. The decision is hers, and none of you know the reason for that difficult decision she is making. She may have consulted with her physician, her family, person of faith or counselor. Maybe there was no one to speak with about this decision. She has the right to have the procedure done with the safety and professionalism of a health care provider. How dare you sit there in judgement over this most difficult personal decision. Is pregnancy caused by rape or incest ok with you, or making a 12 year old child deliver a baby?

Amending the Iowa Constitution is an expensive and cumbersome proceeding stretching out into years. It is absolutely unnecessary; federal law already grants a woman the right to make that difficult decision without interference from the state, at least until viability. The state has an interest in what happens once a fetus is viable, and on that, Iowas current laws are sufficient and working well, and do not need further interference by the Legislature. A woman has the right to control her medical needs with the advice and counsel of her medical professionals, and of her clergy if she wishes to. I want my legislators to concentrate on protecting life by funding good health insurance, good mental health facilities, and good schools. That gives them plenty to do.

The Iowa Republican patriarchy, with their invasive and disturbing obsession with the reproductive lives of Iowa women is not about what is best for Iowans. It is, without a doubt, a dark and dangerous move to regulate Iowa women to secondclass citizens, impose an undue burden, and violate the Constitutional rights to abortion affirmed in the 1973 Roe v Wade legal decision. I strongly oppose this amendment and respectfully suggest the Iowa Republican Senators responsible for this idea focus their efforts on improving the lives of all Iowans rather than attempting to exert their personal opinions and religious beliefs on the women of Iowa.

Please consider the lives of women when voting on this amendment! Im old enough to remember the days when abortion was illegal and it was frightening. I morally oppose abortion and would support any of my loved ones in an unplanned pregnancy in the best way possible to ensure the health of mother and baby, HOWEVER I know that this must be a decision that each woman decides for herself. I do not have a magic ball that tells me every situation that a woman or girl may be in and neither do you. I beg you to vote for the health and safety of the women of Iowa by voting NO.

Several women that I have heard commented on an abortion that they have had. It is the guilt feeling that they had taken the life of their very own child. Abortion is wrong even any age. Just because we cannot hear the baby scream does not make it right or take away the guilt that will come. One day they that do an abortion or have it done and those that support it will one day stand before God in Judgement.

My name is Cathy Kurtinitis and I am writing to ask for you to support HJR 2004, proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa that confirms that nothing in said Constitution shall be construed to grant a right to abortion or taxpayer funding of abortions. I agree with Senator Jake Chapman when he says, "March 15, 1858, the General Assembly adopted a law making abortion a crime under all circumstances. Except unless the same shall be necessary to preserve the life of such woman. Abortion remained generally illegal in Iowa until Roe v. Wade was decided. Given this timing, the fact that a ban on abortion was adopted right after the Constitution became effective, it is difficult to conceive that a legislatively mandated waiting period for abortion would have violated the original understanding of either Article 1 Section 6 or Article 1 Section 9. Six months later they pass a law banning all abortion. To say this is a living document and they had no consideration of abortion when they wrote Art 1 Sec 65 and Sec 9 is false. Its not true. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Right there in the Declaration of Independence. Do we really think that it was any coincidence that they put it in that order? Without life, there is no liberty. Without life and liberty, there is no pursuit of happiness. Its that simple. LIFE is of primal importance to Iowans. Please vote to protect life.

This constitutional amendment would ban abortion in Iowa. Abortions did not begin with Roe v. Wade or the Planned Parenthood case. Abortions will not end if a ban is imposed. They will simply stop being safe and legal (and affordable). This constitutional amendment would extinguish a woman's right to bodily integrity and reproductive autonomy, would interfere with women's health and wellbeing, and literally endanger the lives of women and girls. The supporters of this amendment are guided by religious beliefs that are theirs to have, but they cannot enforce those religious beliefs on everyone else. That is not how freedom of religion works.I urge those who care about women and children to focus their energies on improving the maternal mortality rate in Iowa, increasing access to maternity departments in rural Iowa, adding more OBGYNs, and making sex education and access to contraception more widely available. Those things will actually help women and children, unlike than this dangerous constitutional amendment.Please vote NO on HJR 2004.

20 Facts on AbortionFact #1 Every single abortion kills, ends the life, and murders an innocent human being. Every new life begins at conception. This is an irrefutable fact of biology. A visible electric spark is produced when the sperm penetrates the egg, in that instant that human being now has all the genetic information he/she will ever have.Fact #2 Every human being is a person. Personhood is properly defined by membership in the human kind, not by stage of development within that kind. A living being's designation to a kind is determined not by the stage of development but by the sum total of its biological characteristics.Fact #3 Beginning at conception, every pregnancy involves two or more bodies. No matter how you spin it, women don't have four arms and four legs when they're pregnant. Those extra limbs belong to the tiny human being(s) living inside of them. At no point in pregnancy is the developing baby simply a part of the mother's body.Fact #4 It is just, reasonable, and necessary for society to outlaw certain choices. Any civilized society restricts the individuals freedom to choose whenever that choice would harm an innocent person. Therefore, it is impossible to justify abortion by simply arguing that women should be free to choose.Fact #5 The right to not be killed supersedes the right to not be pregnant. The comparison between a baby's rights and a mother's rights is unequal. What is at stake in abortion is the mothers lifestyle, as opposed to the babys LIFE. Therefore, it is reasonable for society to expect an adult to live temporarily with an inconvenience if the only alternative is killing a child.Fact #6 Poverty, rape, incest, disability, or unwanted do not morally justify abortion. There are all sorts of circumstances that people point to as justification for their support of abortion. Since none of these circumstances are sufficient to justify the killing of human beings after birth, they are not sufficient to justify the killing of human beings before birth.Fact #7 The difference between embryo and adult are differences of degree, not of kind. Like toddler, prepubescent and adolescent, the terms embryo and fetus do not refer to nonhumans but to humans at particular stages of development. Human beings inside the womb are smaller, less developed, and more dependent than human beings outside the womb. These are differences of degree, not differences of kind. We can all point to people who are bigger, stronger, smarter, or less dependent than we are, but that doesn't make our life any less valuable or any less deserving of protection.Fact # 8 Less than 1% of all abortions are performed to save the life of the mother. It is an extremely rare case when abortion is required to save the mothers life. Of course, when two lives are threatened, and only one can be saved, doctors must always save that life. However, abortion to save the mothers life, and abortion on demand are as far removed as the East is from the West. Since every abortion kills an innocent human being, it is morally despicable to use the rare cases when abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother as justification for the millions of on demand convenience abortions.Fact #9 To be personally proLIFE is not to be proLIFE at all. Since abortion kills, why would you defend another persons right to kill a human being? Being personally against abortion but favoring another's right to kill is contradictory and morally bankrupt.Fact #10 If there is uncertainty about when human life begins, the benefit of any doubt should go to preserving life. It is scientific fact that life begins at conception. However, if one personally has even a shred of uncertainty about when life begins, then they are morally obliged to err on the side of life and NOT have an abortion. Why? Because to make a mistake about the exact time when life begins is to kill an innocent human being.Fact #11 Abortion is more dangerous than childbirth. Not only does every abortion kill an innocent human being; but abortion is also much more dangerous to the mother than if she were to give birth to the child. The evidence overwhelmingly proves that the mortality rates of mothers undergoing legal abortion are several times higher than mortality rates of mothers carrying the pregnancy to term.Fact #12 Before legalization and the resulting proliferation of abortion, 9 out of 10 abortions were done by doctors, not with coat hangers in back alleys. Some justify abortion on the claim that if it is outlawed, women will still seek abortions and die in higher numbers then currently. There are 3 problems with this hypothesis. First : It doesn't address the moral and ethical bankruptcy of abortion. Second : Laws against abortion would deter most women from having one. Third : There is no evidence that illegal abortions are more dangerous than legal abortions. Even if the back alley coat hanger argument was true, it's still indefensible to legalize procedures that kill babies just to make the killing procedures less dangerous to the mother.Fact #13 The 8 week unborn baby feels real physical pain during an abortion. Yes, every abortion kills an innocent human being. Even more alarming is the fact that beginning at the 8th week of development, an unborn baby that is aborted feels pain during the abortion. The baby feels both psychological and real physical pain. Let that sink in. In talking about the question of fetal pain, we must remember that it ultimately has no bearing on the morality of abortion.Fact #14 Abortion is condemned for the same reasons that slavery and genocide are. The GOD given right to live free is violated as an active policy. Networks of killing centers across the globe are exterminating unwanted, unborn children at a staggering rate. At the end of the day, if the unborn are people (and they are), then abortion is not only comparable to past crimes against humanity but is also, by sheer volume, the greatest holocaust of all.Fact #15 Abortion is not just a women's issue. In addition to the immediate and long term physical consequences on the mother, Abortion inflicts real wounds mental, emotional, spiritual, developmental, and relationship on both men and women. These include guilt, trauma, remorse, depression, substance abuse, and other pathos resulting from grave sin. Beyond that, abortion is a human issue, not a gender issue. If abortion kills innocent human life (it does), then everyone, male and female, should stand against it. One doesn't need to be a young girl to oppose sex trafficking of young girls, and one doesn't need to be a woman to oppose abortion.Fact #16 Every legal surgical abortion stops a beating heart and terminates measurable brain waves. What do we call it when a person no longer has a heartbeat or brain waves? Death. It's a scientific fact that life begins at conception, but even more obvious; what should we call it when there is a heartbeat and there are brain waves? Life. It is an indisputable fact that each and every legal surgical abortion in America today stops a beating heart and stops already measurable brain waves.Fact #17: The right to not be killed supersedes the right to privacy. Some defend abortion by claiming that they have a right to privacy. Whether they have an abortion or not is between them and their doctor. Everyone else should stay out of their business. Of course, if abortion kills an innocent human being (it does), then killing done in private is no more acceptable than killing done in public; and the encouragement or assistance of a doctor does not change the nature, consequences, or morality of abortion.Fact #18: Abortion disproportionally targets minority babies. Whatever the intent of the abortion industry may be, by functional standards, abortion is a racist institution. In the United States, black children are aborted at 5 times the rate of white children and Hispanic children don't fare much better. Abortion is the leading cause of death among black Americans. Abortion is by no means an equal opportunity killer.Fact #19: Abortion has become a form of gendercide, shrinking the global female population at an alarming rate. On top of the fact that every abortion kills an innocent human being, abortion has also become the driving force in eliminating females around the globe. Estimates put the global gender gap somewhere between 100 and 200 million people. Abortion has become the most effective means of sexism ever devised, ridding the world of multitudes of unwanted females.Fact #20: Laws concerning abortion have significantly influenced whether women choose to have abortions. Some will agree that every abortion kills an innocent human being. They will also agree that society has a right to outlaw choices that harm innocent human beings. But even after agreeing those points, some still do not favor more stringent abortion laws because they think that they wouldnt really work there would still be too many abortions. Historical data, common morality, and basic legal theory prove this line of thinking to be false. Outlawing abortion decreases abortion and saves innocent lives.

I would simply say that in all my years I have been alive, that I can't make the sense of an issue of someone standing for the right to end the life of an innocent simply for the sake of conveience. I have heard the arguments for abortion, I have heard questions like "what if the life of the mother is in danger", or "what about rape or incest". In both of those arguments I find that the simple truth is those two points make up a tiny fraction of all the abortions that occur in this country. The simple fact is that the majority of almost all abortions come down to one simple fact, this child is not convenient to my life right now. To end the life of another human being because it isn't convenient is a shame and a tragedy. I weep for a people that would defend the right to life of a convicted murderer that snuffed the life out of someone innocent while in the very same country we defend the right to snuff out the life of an innocent little child simply for convenience. I don't judge anyone specifically, we all stand and bear the shame of millions of lives lost to a culture that cannot bring itself to stand and defend these little lives and give them a chance to see life even if it is being parented by a loving family who would adopt and give that precious life a home, someone who would give anything for that precious life that another would simply throw away. I stand for the lives of the innocent and unborn children and ask for this amendment.

God's most precious gift to us is children.He has a plan for every child at the point of conception. He makes no mistakes. Women should choose not to have sex if they aren't ready to have a baby. Women who are raped should not punish the innocent life that is a part of them because someone did something bad to them. Instead of the government funding abortion, they should be funding adoptions. There are so many people who would love to adopt a baby but can't afford it. Parents should always be consulted before a minor child can have an abortion. Every woman should be made to see an ultrasound of there baby before an abortion so they can see it is a human life. Under no circumstances should a child's body parts be sold!

I write today to voice my complete opposition to HJR 2004. I believe that the purpose of the constitution is to protect individuals' rights, including women's right to bodily autonomy and patientcentered healthcare. Abortion is a medical procedure and a private, personal medical decision between a woman and her care provider. There are already many financial and logistical barriers to obtaining an abortion, and it is discrimination on the part of the State to expressly deny women the right to this procedure. There is no equivalent medical procedure denied to men, and there is no burden equivalent to childbearing that the state puts on the body of men.I am a certified nursemidwife, a woman who has dedicated my life to serving other women. My foundational belief as a healthcare provider is that women have a basic human right to bodily autonomy. This means that an individual woman is the primary person who should get a say about what goes into her body, and what goes on inside her own body. This includes who she has sex with, when, what kind of contraception she uses, and whether or not she carries a pregnancy and bears children.I would also like to point out the hypocrisy of a State that would make pregnancy and birth mandatory for anyone who finds herself in that situation, but also fails to support the Healthy Moms and Babies Act (SF 2062), fails to move forward on legislation to recognize and license certified professional midwives (HSB 522), and cuts the state's K12 education budget. If the State is really serious about this probirth agenda, the State should provide financial support for all children from birth through the conclusion of their college or trade school education. At the very least, go back to funding the incredibly successful program initiated with the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation grant in 2007 that provided free highly effective reversible contraception to Iowa women. That program reduced the number of abortions by 24 percent from 2007 through 2011, and unintended pregnancies by 8 percent (source: https://www.thegazette.com/2012/12/19/contraceptionprogramisaniowasuccess).I need the State to understand this: my body belongs to ME, my sisters' bodies belong to them. Not to the State, not to the Church, not to husbands or boyfriends or pedophile uncles or serial rapists, not even to our own children. How dare the State of Iowa deny women the right to decide for ourselves what we do with our bodies? I had an abortion when I was 19, in California. It was easy to get, safe, judgementfree, and it allowed me to continue my college education and escape an unhealthy relationship, and ultimately have my two wanted children more than a decade later. I took it for granted that I had such freedom to decide for myself when and with whom to make and bear children. Now, I realize that I was naive and incredibly lucky to been able to make that choice for myself. But I will fight tooth and nail for my sisters, for my patients, for my neighbors to have the same freedom that I had. I say to the State, remember our motto: "Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain," and do not take away our right to bodily autonomy.

Access to comprehensive reproductive health care must remain a right for women of all ages. Abortion is one piece of the reproductive health care spectrum. It is an intensely personal health care decision. Government has NO place inserting itself into personal health care decisions.

In addition she had microcephaly, which could contribute to developmental and learning challenges.

Through adoption, we were gifted a beautiful baby girl. She is worth the difficulty of every doctor visit, every tear, and every struggle through a milestone. She is a fighter, and teaches us so much about perseverance. She has proven those predictions wrong in many areas.

I am a woman, mother, scientist, and concerned citizen. I could go into all of the usual arguments about why abortion is wrong. I will simply say this: it comes down to one basic fact. Scientifically, human life begins when a new human person is created, when their unique DNA comes into existence. This human person has never before existed and never will exist again. Throughout their gestation, their body grows, using this DNA to guide it's development. Abortion is the intentional destruction of this unique, individual, HUMAN person no matter if it is done at 9 days or 9 months gestation. So, simply do you support the ending of life by definition, murder? We cannot allow the rampant acceptance of this heinous act to continue in Iowa.

Changing the constitution just to oppress women is a huge step backwards in this state. It is also a slippery slope because this will set a precedent that if you dont agree with something you can just change the constitution to get your way. What is to keep the next administration from doing the exact same thing except in the opposite direction? Body autonomy should be of high priority to everyone no matter what their gender, race, or religion. Banning abortion is just another way of telling women we have no say in what happens to us and we are at the mercy of men to make all of the decisions. While this is currently just an attack on females, this could lead to attacks on any gender, race or religion. Our founding fathers put separation of church and state in the US constitution for a very good reason and religion has absolutely NO place in politics if we want to keep this country fair and inclusive of all people.

If you want to take away abortion rights and claim to be prolife, you better be willing to be protripling welfare, proadoption reform to make it more costeffective and easy to adopt, prohealth care, and procost effective eduction otherwise this legislation is hypocritical and tells me that anyone who supports this legislation is in fact not prolife. Stay out of free people's bedrooms and stay out of free people's bodies. That is not the role of the government. More importantly, no legislation like this, or person supporting it, can claim that they have the right to impose their life experience onto other citizens. Not everyone has the luxury of growing up in a supportive household with a network of resources and support around them. You can't limit access to family planning AND take away a women's right to choose at the same time. It literally is crazy, hypocritical, and represents major government overreach.

If this is a right that the people want to have protected in the courts, then an amendment must be made to our Constitution stating that the right exists. I support HJR 2004.

I am very much so opposed to this amendment to the Iowa Constitution. A woman, herself alone, should be in control over what she does with, and what happens to, her own body. I can't imagine what it must be like for a pregnant woman to experience the toil of whether to abort or carry to term, but I am 100% certain that it is not my place, nor anyone else's to make that choice for her. This entire topic in our politics is visceral and emotional in nature. Whether one is personally prochoice, or prolife, I do not believe it is the prerogative of any governing body at any level, to get involved so intimately, and furthermore, so controllingly, into women's lives. Although I am prochoice, I understand the prolife position and do not feel that it comes from a bad place. However, I just do not feel that the best way to address abortion is to force women into a position where they have no choice, no say, over what happens to their bodies. I wonder, what kind of dangerous precedent could this kind of Constitutional Amendment set? What other kinds of limitations on people's bodies will be able to be imposed from here if this in fact does pass? If the idea behind this amendment is truly to help prevent unwanted pregnancy, then I urge our elected officials, to seek alternative strategy. Investing in health & sex education, availability of contraception, and community support programs, these are avenues where I feel this topic can much more effectively be addressed. Additionally, I would ask, is there any real evidence that this kind of action will truly prevent abortion from happening? Or will this simply force women into the shadows and engage in dangerous medical procedures that threaten her own health and wellbeing? Please consider the harm that this can and will cause to Iowan women. Finally, if this measure does in fact become the law of our land, I would like to think that the people that vote in favor of this measure, will enthusiastically and wholeheartedly champion sweeping legislation to publicly fund universal childcare in Iowa, universal prek, free instate higher education, supplemental nutrition assistance, and housing assistance. If we are truly going to legislate that we are prolife, let's make sure we are actually prolife, not just probirth.

This bill is appalling. There are many reasons a woman may need an abortion during pregnancy. I have had 2 friends diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after giving birth, one had an aggressive form and died before her baby was 1 year old. The other successfully completed chemo. Neither knew they had breast cancer while they were pregnant, but if they had known and wanted to complete chemo to save their lives, under this bill they may not be able to. I have many questions about the repercussions of this bill: What if something goes wrong with my pregnancy and I need one? Could I be denied an abortion because it says in our constitution that I have no right to one? Would my insurance try to deny coverage, even if my doctor determines it's necessary for my health? Would my doctor be unwilling to give me an abortion, even if medically necessary, because risk of criminal charges? If I miscarry, will I be investigated? What if I get raped and get pregnant, can I get an abortion? My first pregnancy was high risk, and I had complications that required a csection. What if this pregnancy is harder or I die because of complications? Should my daughter grow up without a mother because I was raped and died in childbirth? If there are exceptions for rape or incest, does it have to be proven in a court of law for me to get an abortion? How long would this take? How much money would I have to spend on attorney fees? What if false claims of rape increase as a result? What if abused women are too scared to file a charge, or if they just want to move on with their life? What about women in low paying jobs or with poor healthcare? I was lucky to have good healthcare and a good job with sick time that I could use when it was too hard to work while I was pregnant. Should others be forced to endure an agonizing pregnancy or risk losing their job? What if I get cancer while pregnant and need treatment that would severely harm the baby? Do I have to file an appeal or fill out some application to save my life? Who decides this? How long would the approval process take? What if a baby has unsurvivable abnormalities? How do you know that you aren't forcing a baby in the womb to endure severe pain?These are just some of the very personal worries that I and other women go through, and legislators are forcing us to face our deepest fears. All of these are questions that I shouldn't have to ask my legislators, and they have no right to answer them. These are decisions that should be made between me, my family and my doctor.Instead of making pregnancy and birth harder on women, all legislators and the Governor should be focusing on improving maternal health. We have the LEAST number of obstetricians per capita in the country, our maternal mortality rate has DOUBLED from 2015 to 2018. It is particularly hard in rural areas to find appropriate obstetric care during pregnancy and this bill will exacerbate these issues.

No. Just no. A corpse should not have more body autonomy than a living woman. The Iowa Constitution recognizes that humans are equal and humans should have control over their bodies. This includes not being forced against their will to provide blood or any other organs to save a life. If a woman wants to cease carrying a fetus, that is her right as it is not required. Unless all of you want to sign up to be organ donors without consent if the organs are needed, you need to stop this.

I am a constituent from Ankeny, and I strongly oppose this bill. While I understand that there are many people who oppose access to abortion, it is truly a vital, life saving procedure. There are women who need them to survive and taking away access to abortions may well take their lives. The choice to have an abortion is not a cavalier decision, it is a difficult decision to make. Instead of expending so much effort on removing access to vital, life saving procedures, I instead urge those who consider themselves "ProLife" to put those efforts into providing care for low income families and single mothers. Perhaps those efforts make make the thought of a child less daunting to those who feel they have no choice. I also implore those seeking to remove access to abortion to value the life of the woman, and consider how being forced to have a child will affect her. Any woman seeking an abortion has certainly done so and should have the right to make hold her future in her own hands.

Legislating a moral code is tyranny. Abortion does no harm to the state, but the oppression of reproductive rights does great harm to society. Can people not be trusted to act in their best interests, and decide what those actions will be? The authors and signers of this bill imply that the people are unable to make these choices themselves."To turn all moral obligations into legal obligations would be to destroy morality. Happily it is impossible. No code of law can envisage the myriad changing situations that determine moral obligations. Moreover, there must be one legal code for all, but moral codes vary as much as the individual characters of which they are the expression. To legislate against the moral codes of ones fellows is a very grave act, requiring for its justification the most indubitable and universally admitted of social gains, for it is to steal their moral codes, to suppress their characters."R.M.

In April of 2017, my dad was diagnosed with cancer. He lives alone and my husband and I were taking him to Rochester to receive chemo treatments. We both were exhausting our personal days and knew we needed a change. So, we made the decision to move closer to home and relocate to care for my dad. I resigned and my husbands insurance didnt kick in until the end of July. No insurance = no pill. With my husbands new job, we were not able to use our previous doctor, so knew we needed to find a new one. With moving, taking care of my dad, looking for a job, etc. My healthcare took a back seat. When we finally got settled in late August, I called to make a wellappointment and schedule my yearly. The wait three months. Had I been able to get a year supply of the pill or longer than three months at a time, my BC would not have been interrupted.Fast forward to December and we learned I was pregnant. Not what I had planned as a 43yearold mother of an 11 and 8yearold. I chalked up my symptoms to stress, work, and because I was not regular it didnt occur to me that I was pregnant. I did not know I was pregnant until I was at 12 weeks. Keep in mind I had been pregnant twice before. Because I am of advanced maternal age there were many concerns. We had a blood test done and found out I tested positive on the Downs Syndrome and fetal abnormality test. This was at about 16 weeks. I would now head to Mayo in Rochester to have a fetal anatomy scan and further blood tests. They would not do this test until closer to 20 weeks. So, more waiting and worrying. On February 8th, we got the news from Mayo that our baby was 90% likely to proceed with a normal pregnancy. At 21 weeks, this was a wanted baby. However, as we continued for the duration of the pregnancy, we learned that our baby had stopped growing. We had more tests and at this point in the pregnancy, there was nothing more the doctors could do or further diagnose. It was more waiting, planning and preparing for the worst. Our baby arrived early, but healthy with a few minor complications. We were incredibly lucky. Throughout the duration of this pregnancy, we as parents consulted the best doctors we could and were as informed as we could be about the risks of this pregnancy. Thankfully our decisions for care were not limited by laws imposed by state or federal legislators. We had choices about our care every step of the way. Women in Iowa want autonomy over our bodies and the choices the healthcare and reproductive choices that accompany that autonomy. And, we trust that lawmakers will understand the overreach this Constitutional Amendment has in limiting a womans choice for the best care and treatment for herself.

This bill fails to clarify any definition of abortion or provide terms under which what is normally called an abortion would be legal for mothers of stillborns, mothers in an early term whose lives might be in danger, or other commonlysupported and importanttospecify situations. Complications will ask arise from the lack of defining abortion. Is this strictly an intended action of a surgical or medical procedure, or would it also encompass the side effect of either naturallyoccurring processes or chemicallyinduced processes? Because the bill offers no clarity, we would be left with no clarity in the law. Because these issues are left unclear, this bill is in no position to provide legal clarity to Iowans, and it is not appropriate to bring it to a vote in its current form. Iowa legislators need to think through these issues they which they may view as being at the margin, and provide clarity to Iowans so we may engage in a productive discussion of the proper definition limits of abortion. Merely attempting to ban abortion carte blanche is an overly blunt and ultimately unproductive action.

As has been proven countless times throughout our great Nation's history, prohibition of a thing does not stop its use. Instead, it removes regulation of the thing and moves its production into less safe territory. The act of abortion is serious. It is never an action chosen lightly. However, the wording of this amendment does not manage to do what it proclaims in a safe manner. The blanket statement that this proposed amendment uses makes it such that in the case that a pregnancy may endanger the life of the mother, a doctor is prohibited from inducing an abortion in order to save the mother's life. This proposal sacrifices one life for the chance to possibly save a different life, if that life survives without the mother as host. This trade is a poorly conceived one, as it is equivalent to paying a dollar in order to possibly receive a dollar eventually.By proposing this blanket ban, the authors have shown to have a severe lack of forethought in what their words mean, and what dangers they will cause.

I am willing to support a limit on gestational age without medical attestation of medical necessity for abortion, but every case deserves consideration. Unless the state intends to support the parents and child (food, housing, daycare, medical and dental care) it should not be allowed to impose its will on the family.

I do not love in Iowa but I was born in Cedar Rapids and lived in Bettendorf. I humbly ask thatYou vote for HJR2004 and make Iowa an even better pace to live! Spend the money on vulnerable women and children, not on abortion. Thank you!

Im in support of this. We need to restore the check and balance between the legislative, judicial and executive branches.

As an Iowa resident, I wholeheartedly support this bill. What is growing in the womb of a pregnant woman but a human child? It's not just any zygote, it is a human zygote. It's not just tissue belonging to the mother. Every human has tissue, and we received that from our mothers. Being nonviable outside the womb is not an obstacle to being human. All of us depend on others in order to survive. Being smaller or less capable does not negate one's humanity. May this bill pass. I pray it does.

Protect Iowans. Restricting abortion is dangerous and unnecessary. The Iowa Constitution should not dictate the appropriateness of needed medical procedures.

Abortion should be legal, but only during the first trimester unless there are major issues with the pregnancy.Most people that choose to undergo the procedure do so with a heavy heart and do not do so flipantly.In the case of consensual sex: contraception doesn't always work. If the couple became pregnant and were unable to care for the child due to their own circumstances. I don't think it is ethical to force the woman to have a child she know she can't support, incur that medical debt, and have to make the difficult choice of keeping the baby in a potentially difficult situation, or giving the baby to an unknown person(s).

A woman's medical care is between her and her doctor. She also has the right to make decisions about her own body. I am vehemently opposed to this amendment.

Abortion isn't even mentioned in the state of Iowa constitution, so there is nothing prohibiting it either. It is cruel to force a mother to bring a child to term if they do not have the means or mental faculty to take care of the baby, and it is equally cruel to bring a child into a world that will not or can not take care of it.

We need to keep reproductive rights in place. We do not need to keep revisiting females right to choice. Women need and must have the right to control their own bodies, especially during the first 23 weeks of a pregnancy when that pregnancy is nonviable.
