The CLAT 2020 was scheduled to be conducted in May earlier this year but was postponed due to the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic and subsequent lockdown.

“No candidate will be allowed to enter examination centre without a mask. Appropriate respiratory etiquette will also be maintained at all times. Detailed instructions in this regard will be notified on the consortium website,” it read.
The earlier notification on safety precautions included social distance, thermal screening and isolation labs for candidates who show symptoms of COVID-19 . The consortium will review centre locations on an ongoing basis to ensure that students and staff are protected at all times.
Admit cards
The consortium is in the process of securing further permissions so that admit cards of candidates can be considered as movement passes by local authorities to allow them to move between containment zones and travel to their designated examination centres. These admit cards — indicating the roll number and the centre — will be available for download from the website ( consortiumofnlus.ac.in ) in two weeks.
The consortium has advised the candidates and parents to keep visiting the website for latest updates, as further instructions as necessary will be issued in due course.
