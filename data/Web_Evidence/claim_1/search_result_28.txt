Trumpâ€™s Unprecedented Funding Freeze Hits Communities Across America
Since taking office, President Trump has trampled over our nation's laws and choked off critical investments that families, businesses, and local governments in every zip code in America are counting on.
The tracker below offers a snapshot-in-time look, as of June 3, 2025, at the vast array of federal funding that should be going out the door, but that President Trump, in an unprecedented scheme, is holding up or actively fighting in court to block.
Scroll through for a look at the $425+ billion in funding President Trump is blocking, and click HERE to read commentary from Ranking Member DeLauro and learn more about the project.
The tracker was first released this spring and will be updated periodically. View the April 29th update HERE.
More Information on the Tracker
Compiled by the Democratic staffs of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the tracker details the minimum amount of federal funding the Committees believe the administration is currently freezing, cancelling, or fighting in court to block. This list is not comprehensive or exhaustive, but it catalogs a wide range of investments that the Trump administration is choking off, in many cases illegally. It does not detail tens of billions of dollars in funding that President Trump has previously frozen but finally allowed to flow, and it cannot measure the incredible cost of President Trump's illegal funding freezes to American families, businesses, and communities. Additionally, it does not capture the wide range of funding at serious risk of not going out the door because of President Trump's unprecedented mass firings or the full range of fiscal year 2025 funding that has yet to be awarded or disbursed, but that should be flowing.
In some instances, there are programs and priorities listed in the tracker that courts have ordered the Trump administration to release, rebuking President Trump's unprecedented assault on our spending laws. Funding for those programs is listed because the Trump administration is actively fighting in court to block it; any relief provided by the courts at this stage is only temporary; and because this administration has over the last several months, whether through intentional defiance or sheer incompetence, repeatedly failed to get funding to its intended recipients even when ordered by a court to do so.
