CLAT stands for Common Law Admissions Test. It is an all India entrance examination conducted by the Consortium of NLUs for admissions to the under-graduate and post graduate degree programmes (LL. B & LL.M) of 22 National Law Universities in India. CLAT this year has been exceptional in many ways as it saw a sweeping change in the exam pattern, total no of questions, multiple reschedules owing to Covid-19, and controversy even when NLSIU Bangalore, just a couple of weeks before the CLAT, decided to conduct their own separate exam - NLAT. Although the Hon’ble Supreme Court later scrapped the NLAT and ordered NLSIU to accept CLAT 2020 score only.
Then the day arrived finally, and every nay-sayer was laid to rest in peace. The consortium conducted the CLAT 2020 successfully from 2 PM to 4 PM on 28th September. The exam this year was originally slated to be conducted in Paper & Pencil mode but due to several postponements already it was conducted in the Computer based Test format. Many students heaved a sigh of relief as the exam has been due for quite some time.
A total of 75,183 candidates applied for CLAT-2020 out of which 68,833 candidates had downloaded the admit cards. Of those who had downloaded the admit cards, 86.20% appeared for the test.
