At a rare local event in Spring Hill on Saturday, Rep. Andy Ogles came looking for a fight.
After multiple screaming altercations with protesters and constituents — who were barred from the event and removed from the property by police — Ogles took questions at an Americans for Prosperity event called “One Big Beautiful Breakfast,” where the congressman was set to discuss the controversial Republican spending bill passed by Congress this summer.
Ogles defended the bill, his efforts to amend the Constitution and allow President Donald Trump a third term and inexplicably said that blue states were spending money on “housing for gay frogs,” when discussing appropriation bills. The congressman also told constituents that Tennessee was currently “overrepresented” in Congress because of how much access he and Rep. Tim Burchett have to the president.
“I have a job to do. I defend the president’s agenda. I’m very close to the president, and I’m not going to back off,” Ogles said.
The particular piece of Trump’s agenda most discussed by Ogles and his critics was the use of the National Guard in domestic policing, which the president has done in Washington, D.C. and threatened to do in other Democratic cities. While Tennessee has several hundred troops in D.C., Ogles has called for the guard to address crime in Memphis and Nashville.
“If Freddie O’Connell wants to be a man, he wants to defend his city, he wants to stand up for these people, then I’ll stand right there with him,” Ogles said. “But until he does, I’m gonna keep punching him in the nose.”
“Politically speaking,” Ogles added after a pause.
Ogles’ comments are part of his ongoing beef with Nashville’s mayor, which started when Metro Nashville Police did not participate in a week-long ICE and Tennessee Highway Patrol traffic sting in May, which targeted South Nashville’s immigrant community. Following the operation, Ogles called for Congress to investigate O’Connell and accused the mayor of doxxing ICE agents whose names were listed but later removed from a database of ICE interactions with MNPD.
“So instead of Freddie O’Connell hindering ICE agents, fantasizing about me and giving speeches, he should secure his dadgum city, or I will personally call the president and ask him to bring the National Guard in,” Ogles said.
After the event, Ogles told the Banner that Memphis should “obviously” be prioritized over Nashville because of FBI crime statistics, which show Memphis as the city with the highest violent crime rate in the country.
“If the president were to call and say, ‘Hey Ogles, what do you think?’ I would say, ‘Mr. President, obviously, when you look at statistics, when you look at data, it is a more dire situation in Memphis. But if we could spare the resources, I think Nashville would benefit from it, too,’” Ogles said. “So again, just follow facts.”
Ogles then said he would only call for the National Guard “if Freddie O’Connell doesn’t do his job.”
Asked to define that, the congressman said that the mayor would need to “empower the policemen, help ICE and Homeland Security” to get Ogles to stop.
He also claimed that Metro Nashville Police officers have called and asked for Ogles’ help in getting them involved in immigration efforts.
“They call and say, ‘We need you,’” Ogles said.
O’Connell brushed off Ogles during a weekly news conference on Friday, noting a 12 percent decline in violent crime this year and the creation of a new director of crime prevention role in the city.
“I understand that this is a congressman who is himself under investigation and seems to be showing off for the president so he can get a pardon,” the mayor added, calling some of Ogles’ claims about crime “absurd” and noting that the Congressman does not live or have an office in Nashville.
Drew Barto, who served in the Illinois National Guard before becoming a staff sergeant in the Tennessee National Guard, stood in the rain outside of Ogles’ event to protest what he sees as a politically motivated misuse of the guard.
“Crime has dropped, and that’s because of the efforts that the Metro Nashville Police Department has made to combat crime, and those efforts should be supported,” Barto said, adding that Ogle’s comments are “disgusting” and an effort to use the military as “a political tool.”
Citing the Posse Comitatus Act, which is intended to prevent the use of military troops in domestic issues, but allows certain exceptions with Congressional approval, Barto said he and some other current and former members of the guard have “grave concerns” about the deployment in D.C. and threat of similar “toxic missions” in other cities.
“You cannot use us to be political pawns in little schemes, because that’s not what we’re for, and it’s a gross violation of what the military is supposed to do,” Barto added. “And the fact that an elected representative is doing it is abhorrent.”
Rare public appearance
Barto was only one of the Ogles’ critics who came to the event hoping to air their grievances with the congressman.
Before Ogles arrived, a group of his constituents from Indivisible Tennessee waited at a table to discuss their concerns about cuts to rural hospitals and Medicaid in the bill, as well as to confront him for not being accessible to voters.
Among them were Teri Mai of Spring Hill and Mindy Sontag of Franklin. Sontag, frustrated by Ogles’ targeting of O’Connell on the National Guard and ICE, said it was about political parties, and not Ogles representing constituents.
“It’s because the mayors of Nashville and Memphis are Democrats,” Sontag said. So it seems like [Ogles] cares more about representing Trump’s agenda than representing us as constituents of this state.”
Mai said she was there after routinely calling Ogles’ congressional office to no avail.
“I almost always get the answering machine,” Mai said, noting that he has never responded to any of her messages.
Ogles — who does telephone town halls with screened questions but does not provide any regular, open opportunity for constituents to provide feedback — is part of a growing trend of GOP legislators being inaccessible or only accessible to their supporters. Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn has been similarly criticized for not hosting open events in Tennessee, and constituents recently held a town hall in Rep. John Rose’s name, providing feedback to a picture of him in an empty chair. Rep. Chuck Fliechmann said last week that he will “never” do a town hall again.
The women had signs depicting Ogles’ notorious 2022 Christmas card photo where he, his wife and kids posed with AR-15 assault rifles just months before the Covenant School shooting in his district.
Ogles briefly joined the group in the dining room outside of the event space, where he posed with the sign, and then he yelled with them about whether guns or transgender people were the cause of that shooting.
Ogles said that it was “transgender weirdos” causing school shootings, later adding that “transgenderism is a mental illness.”
When Sontag chimed in, asking if Ogles believed transgender people were “the only people killing,” Ogles did not respond, but continued berating another member of the group.
As he left the room, he yelled to Sontag, “If a dude wants to wear a dress, he can wear a dress. He looks stupid, but he can still wear a dress.”
When Sontag later tried to enter the event, after making a reservation online, she was denied entry by an AFP organizer. The two went back and forth over whether she could enter while another organizer tried to obscure the view of the exchange with a partially opened umbrella. Ultimately, Sontag was not allowed in and returned to the hallway.
Confronting protesters
As Ogles made the rounds at tables of his supporters, a protester with a bullhorn showed up behind the area where the Q&A was set to take place, putting only a grated wall made of a chickenwire-esque material between the AFP event and what had grown to be around two dozen protesters.
Protesters shouted, “Nobody likes Andy,” and some carried an upside-down American flag and other signs denouncing Ogles.
A protester in unmarked black clothes, a white kerchief covering most of his face and opaque yellow sunglasses in the rain to conceal his identity, carried an anti-fascist flag, apparently catching Ogles’ attention.
After one Spring Hill Police officer arrived, Ogles slipped through the side door to confront the group of protesters, immediately getting into a second, more aggressive shouting match with the protester with the flag.
As the crowd heckled Ogles, calling him “disgusting” and “an idiot” and criticizing him for not allowing them to attend the Q&A, Ogles and the masked protester screamed and pointed inches from each other’s faces, with a second masked protester waving his middle finger in Ogles’ face and the officer close behind.
The exchange lasted nearly a minute until Ogles went back inside, grinning.
When another four police officers arrived, protesters were made to leave the private sidewalk near the event and stand on a public easement across the parking lot.
Some of the crowd remained, playing distant chirping and siren sounds on the bullhorn, shouting intermittently and evoking a few car horns during Ogles’ speech.
Ogles basked in the drama, taking pictures with a young supporter as cops removed protesters in the background.
“I just had a lovely conversation with them,” Ogles jeered.
During the event, Ogles said that the protesters had the right to be there, but repeatedly mocked them for being “knuckleheads.”
He also boasted how accessible he is to his constituents, claiming that his office tracks constituent response times and is “known for our customer service.”
“I want to hear from you. I literally want to hear from you,” Ogles added.
