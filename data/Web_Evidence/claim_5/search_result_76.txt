Are you ready to start your law school journey?
Studies have consistently shown the LSAT to be the single best predictor of first-year law school performance, even better than undergraduate grade-point average. An integral part of law school admission, the LSAT is also the only test that helps prospective law students determine if law school is right for them. Prospective law students who want to maximize their chances for admission and be best prepared for law school are encouraged to take the LSAT.

Components of the LSAT
The primary part of the LSAT is a four-section, multiple-choice test. It’s important you familiarize yourself with the different types of LSAT questions so you can optimize your test preparation and put yourself in a position to succeed. All LSAT takers are also required to complete a written essay called LSAT Argumentative Writing.
