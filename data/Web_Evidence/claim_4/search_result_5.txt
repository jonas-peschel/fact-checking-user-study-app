Jacob Blake was calmly walking away from Kenosha police towards an SUV when an officer opened fire - shooting him several times in the back while his three young children watched from inside the car. He is thankfully still alive, but the attack sent him to the hospital fighting for his life, and has ultimately left him paralyzed from the waist down. Unfortunately, Mr. Blake’s story is not a unique one. The violence that was perpetrated against him is in line with a system of American policing that has harassed, brutalized and murdered Black people since its inception. We will fight relentlessly to help win justice for Jacob and his family, and we will not rest until there is an end to racist policing in America.
