ICYMI: “Trump seizes victory in border wall fight with new funding”
President Donald J. Trump made finishing the border wall a central campaign promise — and he continues to deliver. Using existing funding halted by the Biden Administration and new funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill, the Trump Administration is swiftly moving forward to build hundreds of miles of new border wall and make other technological and safety improvements that will make the southern border the most secure in modern history.
“Just months into his new term, Mr. Trump already has 100 miles of border barrier in the works and Capitol Hill just approved an additional $46.5 billion to add hundreds more miles to that total, finishing out his marquee promise from his 2016 campaign.
The money was approved this summer with barely a whimper from lawmakers as part of Mr. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill budget law…
Customs and Border Protection said it already has 83 miles of traditional wall and 17 miles of waterborne barriers either under construction or in planning, using money left over from the first Trump administration. Those are dollars President Biden slow-walked, but which never expired and were waiting for the new president in January.
CBP also says it already has a ‘robust acquisition strategy’ to spend the new money, which will fill out Mr. Trump’s border wall vision and fill in gaps Mr. Biden left when he halted all construction on his first day in office in 2021. …
Art Del Cueto, a former Border Patrol agent who’s now with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said the lower numbers aren’t a reason to let up on border improvements.
He said walls work by shaping how illegal immigrants attempt to cross. That means agents can be better positioned to respond and catch the people who do make it over.”
