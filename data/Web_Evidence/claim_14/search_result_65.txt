12 Situations Where Police Officers Can Arrest Without Warrant. Daily Law Tips (Tip 350) by Onyekachi Umah, Esq., LLM. ACIArb(UK)
12 Situations Where Police Officers Can Arrest Without Warrant. (When EFCC Can Arrest Without Warrant).
The Police, EFCC, DSS and other law enforcement agencies need warrant of arrest (authority) to lawfully arrest a person but there are few exceptions to this. There are situations where a police officer or any law enforcement agent can arrest any person without a warrant of arrest/court order.
Below are situations when the Police, EFCC, DSS and any other law enforcement agent can arrest Without Warrant/court order;
1. Where a police officer reasonably suspects that a person has committed an offence against any law in Nigeria or outside Nigeria. And that the law creating such offence does not prohibit an arrest without warrant.
2. Where an offence is committed in presence of a police officer not minding that such offence is one that requires a warrant of arrest for an offender to be arrested.
3. Where a person obstructs a police officer or escapes or attempts to escape from lawful custody.
4. Where a person is in possession of a reasonably suspected stolen thing or a person is reasonably suspected of committing an offence with respect of such thing.
5. Where a person is reasonably suspected of being a deserter from any of the armed forces of Nigeria.
6. Where a person is reasonably suspected of having committed an offence outside Nigeria, an offence that is also an offence in Nigeria and there is also a law in Nigeria that allows such person to be arrested and detained in Nigeria.
7. Where a person is in possession of an implement of housebreaking, car theft or firearms or offensive weapon without lawful excuse.
8. Where a person is believed to be one of whom a warrant of arrest has been issued by a competent court in Nigeria.
9. Where a person is reasonably suspected of trying to conceal himself in order to commit an offence.
10. Where a person‚Äôs warrant of arrest has been issued by a court, Justice of peace or superior police officer.
11. Where a person is reasonably suspected of designing/planning to commit an offence, an offence for which arrest can be made without a warrant of arrest and the offence itself cannot be prevented.
12. Where a person is required to appear by a public summon issued in accordance to any law.
