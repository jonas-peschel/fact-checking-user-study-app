Le 7
The passage discusses the history and development of nuclear weapons since their first use in 1945. It notes that: 1) The development of nuclear weapons was likely inevitable due to long-term trends in science, technology, and the escalation of warfare. 2) While nuclear weapons have not ended all wars, their threat of massive destruction has prevented another war on the scale of World War II from occurring between great powers. 3) Despite existing under the shadow of nuclear annihilation for 75 years, the worst-case scenario of nuclear war has remained in abeyance, though the risk of catastrophe remains.
