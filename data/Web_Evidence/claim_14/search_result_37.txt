Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR (17 December 1942 – 13 July 2025) was the President of Nigeria and a former Major General in the Nigerian Army. He first became Head of State of Nigeria on 31 December 1983 when he took over the government by surprise.[2][3] While he was in power, he passed laws to control how people behaved that were very harsh[4] and put many people in jail, even the famous musician Fela Kuti.[5] On 27 August 1985, there was another surprise takeover and he was no longer in charge of the country.
In the 21st century, Buhari decided to try and become head of state again and ran in multiple elections. He eventually won and became President of Nigeria in 2015. He brought back some of the harsh laws from the last time he was in charge of Nigeria.[6] Now, more people have been criticizing him as part of the End SARS protests.
Buhari died in London, England, on 13 July 2025, while receiving medical treatment after being hospitalised, at the age of 82.[7][8][9]
