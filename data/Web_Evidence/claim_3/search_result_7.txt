The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:00 a.m., in Room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Ron DeSantis [chairman of the subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives DeSantis, Duncan, Gosar, Hice, Comer, Demings, Welch and DeSaulnier. Also Present: Representative Grothman. Mr. DeSantis. The Subcommittee on National Security will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time. A core attribute of sovereignty is maintaining control over national boundaries, yet for years we have witnessed the failure of the U.S. Government to secure our southern border. This failure has allowed millions of foreign nationals to enter the United States illegally and has allowed huge amounts of illicit narcotics to be smuggled into the country. This sorry state of affairs has had significant consequences for American taxpayers, for victims of violent crime, and for the rule of law. It is time to secure the border. A central issue of the President's 2006 campaign was the promise to build, quote, ``an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful, southern border wall,'' end quote. The administration is taking steps to fulfill that promise, and the Subcommittee on National Security is closely monitoring this process. The President issued an executive order on January 25 for the Department of Homeland Security to, quote, ``take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct the physical wall along the southern border,'' end quote. On March 17, the DHS issued two requests for proposals for prototype designs as a first step in fulfilling the requirements set forth in the executive order. DHS is expected to use these prototypes to inform actual construction. Now, border walls have seen success in recent years. President Trump has identified Israeli border security measures as a potential model for securing the U.S.-Mexico border. The construction of a security fence on the Israel-Sinai border cut illegal entries from over 16,500 in 2011 to just 43 in 2013 and 12 in 2014, a 99 percent decrease. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remarked that ``President Trump is right; I built a wall on Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration, great success, great idea.'' Now, do those who oppose building a wall dispute that success, or is the reason they oppose building a wall precisely because they acknowledge its potential effectiveness at curbing illegal immigration? I think we have to figure that out. Recent media coverage has focused on the cost of building the wall, and obviously this is a legitimate issue. DHS has only just begun the procurement process, yet opponents of a secure border have resorted to employing exaggerated cost estimates about a border wall. For example, Senate Democrats recently issued a very flawed report claiming that the wall would cost $70 billion. Today's Democratic witness wrote in January, however, that a border wall would cost as much as $14 billion, which is obviously much different than the Senate Democrat estimate. And I think what they did was take the highest historical number they could find and multiply it by the total miles of the border, which I don't think anyone is suggesting is the way to do it. And other opponents of a secure border have parroted sloppy back-of-the-napkin math that is meant to confuse the issue, and the American people deserve better than misinformation. The wall should be built in a fiscally responsible way, and there are a variety of creative ways such as by using the seized assets of drug dealers to build it at little or no cost to the American taxpayer. At the same time, what is rarely discussed but which needs serious inquiry is whether securing the border will have a positive effect on American taxpayers at the local, State, and Federal levels. And today, we will hear testimony from immigration expert Dr. Steven Camarota on the significant burdens that illegal immigration and having an unsecured border can impose on U.S. taxpayers. Dr. Camarota estimates that if a border wall prevented between 160,000 to 200,000 illegal crossings, which is only about 10 percent of the expected crossings in the next decade, then the U.S. would realize between $12-$15 billion in savings. That would effectively offset the cost of building the wall even if you didn't use the seized drug assets. Of course, securing the border is more than about dollars and cents. It is also about our government's duty to secure its borders, defend our sovereignty, and, most importantly, protect our citizens. Illegal immigration has had significant human cost. Too many Americans have been robbed of loved ones through crimes committed by criminal aliens who should not have been allowed in this country to begin with. One of them is Mrs. Agnes Gibboney who lost her son Ronald da Silva 15 years ago today. Ronald was murdered by a previously deported illegal immigrant with a long criminal record, and she herself is a legal immigrant from Hungary. Now, she did it the right way and her son was taken from her by someone who had no right to be in our country. What makes this tragedy and others like it so painful is that Ronald's murder was preventable. Had the government simply done its job and maintained a secure border, the murder would never have been able to enter our country, and Ronald would still be with us. Building a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border will not stop all illegal immigration, but it is a necessary first step and, consistent with experiences in San Diego and Yuma, has the potential to dramatically reduce it. The United States will also need to deploy additional human, technological, and legal resources; in addition, predictable enforcement of immigration laws in the interior of the United States will restore the rule of law and deter would-be illegal immigrants from attempting to circumvent the laws in the first place. We hope that our witness from the National Border Patrol Council, Mr. Brandon Judd, will speak more broadly about what our officers and agents on the ground see on the border every day and what they need to do to do their job. This subcommittee will continue robust oversight over these actions to determining how they are meeting the threat posed by a porous border, and we want to make sure that taxpayer money is being used well, that the barrier is being built in an effective way, and we are going to continue to monitor this as this unfolds over the next year-and-a-half. Mr. DeSantis. I thank the witnesses for being here today and for their testimony. And with that, I yield to--sitting in for my friend from Massachusetts, the ranking member Mr. Lynch, is Mr. DeSaulnier. Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank you and our staffs on both sides and the witnesses today on what is very emotional, I know--and legitimately for some of the witnesses today--issue. But I look forward to public, transparent analysis where we have an objective needs assessment, risk assessment, and an engineering assessment as to the cost-benefit of this potentially huge investment. And Ms. Gibboney, I can't imagine--being a father of two sons who lost a parent to violence, I can't imagine what it is like to be here to sit on this anniversary. So for your loss and your passion to see something is done about that I am very respectful. Insomuch as we may have some differences, I understand I think as best I can of what has brought you here today and the earnest desire you have to see that--to make sure that other parents will never be in the position you are in. Ms. Espinoza, from what I have read in your work, similarly, not as dramatically perhaps, but more globally as you see many, many cases, I very much respect your work and the ultimate desire that you have. And, Mr. Judd, to you and your colleagues, great respect for the work that you do. I know when I was in the California Legislature, many times having conversation with our State law enforcement people about the border, the difficult jobs you do and the Department of Justice in California when they work with you on that. And the other two witnesses, thank you for being here. Let me just add to that that this crucial work we take is very serious. Again, it should be fact-based, looked at, this issue so that we identify what measures will work, what the benefits would be and what the cost would be to the taxpayers and all Americans. The wall that the President is proposing simply won't work in my view and in others' and will divert resources away from the areas critical to protecting the health, safety, and security of Americans. Recently, Oversight Committee member Will Hurd, who represents a district covering 800 miles of the border, addressed his concerns with the President's plan. He wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post in which he called the wall, quote, ``the most expensive and least-effective way to secure the border.'' He also wrote, quote, ``True border security demands a flexible defense in-depth strategy that includes a mix of personnel, technology, and changing tactics, all of which come at a lower price tag than a border wall.'' I am in agreement with my colleague. The proposed wall is incredibly expensive with little if any return on the investment. Despite the fact that the President claims that the wall would cost $10-$12 billion, most analysis place the number far higher. The Department of Homeland Security conducted an internal study that estimated the border wall would cost nearly $22 billion in upfront construction costs alone. Other independent and congressional studies have estimates up to $40 or even $70 billion. This is all in contrast to the programs the same administration has proposed getting, including those that help everyday Americans and provide returns to the American public. It is troubling that the President's budget proposes billions towards a wall while slashing critical domestic programs, including his proposed budget that would cut nearly $6 billion or nearly 20 percent of the funding to the National Institutes of Health, jeopardizing medical advancements to cure chronic diseases and save lives, including cancer. Additionally, the President's proposed wall will undermine our national security by redirecting funds from programs that actually work to secure our border. This money would instead be pulled from important airport security programs that help secure these major points of entry where drugs are much more likely to be trafficked into our borders. Despite the President's rhetoric during the Obama administration, the number of unauthorized immigrants into the United States dropped from 12.2 million to 1.1 million in 2014. During that same time, more people became unauthorized to be in the United States simply by overstaying visas than by coming across the U.S. border with Mexico. At least 40 percent of all individuals in the United States illegally have overstayed their visas rather than coming across the border. The President's proposal to build a solid concrete wall across the length of our southern border fails to be either workable or cost-effective. His request for Congress to appropriate billions of dollars is a shortsighted request for Congress and breaks one of his most fundamental campaign promises that the American people would not pay a dime for the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Mr. Chairman, we have a short video to play at this time. Mr. DeSantis. Without objection. [Video shown.] Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When announcing his presidential bid, the President stated, and I quote, ``I would build a great wall and nobody builds walls better than me. Believe me. And I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words,'' end of quotes. At that February 2016 campaign rally, the President reiterated, ``We will build a great wall along our southern border and Mexico will pay for that wall 100 percent.'' Of course, these are only a few of the countless times the President has overpromised and underdelivered for the American people. Now, less than 100 days into his presidency, he has completely abandoned this promise and changed his tune. Earlier this week, President Trump tweeted that Mexico will pay for the wall, quote, ``eventually and in some form.'' With his track record, nobody should believe that. Instead, he is demanding that American families have the burden of finding additional billions of dollars to build this wall. Until earlier this week, he was signaling that he would be willing to shut down the government to get the leverage to take this money out of the wallets of hardworking American families. We have real problems to address in securing our borders, we all agree, but the President's proposed order wall does nothing to advance--nothing or very little to advance our national security. Not only should it not be built but it absolutely should not be built on the backs of hardworking American families. I yield back. Mr. DeSantis. The gentleman yields back. I will hold the record open for five legislative days for any members who would like to submit a written statement. We will now recognize our panel of witnesses. I am pleased to welcome Mr. Steven Camarota, Ph.D., director of research, Center for Immigration Studies; Mr. Brandon Judd, president, National Border Patrol Council; Ms. Maria Espinoza, director, the Remembrance Project; Ms. Agnes Gibboney, mother of Ronald da Silva, who was killed by an illegal immigrant 15 years ago today; and Mr. Seth Stodder, former assistant secretary for Border, Immigration, And Trade Policy, Department of Homeland Security. Glad you were able to get here. Welcome to you all. Pursuant to committee rules, all witnesses will be sworn in before they testify, so if you could all please rise and raise your right hand. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. DeSantis. Thank you. Please be seated. All witnesses answered in the affirmative. In order to allow time for discussion, please limit your testimony to five minutes. Your entire written statement will be made a part of the record. Mr. Camarota, you are recognized for five minutes. WITNESS STATEMENTS STATEMENT OF STEVEN CAMAROTA Mr. Camarota. Thank you. I would like to thank the chair and the committee for inviting me. My name is Steven Camarota, and I am director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies. My testimony today is based on a recent report published by the Center. This analysis reports the fiscal costs of illegal border crossers based on some fiscal estimates developed by the National Academy of Sciences Engineering and Medicine earlier this year--or I should say last year--for immigrants by education level. These calculations are based on some pretty well-established facts about illegal immigrants. First, there is agreement that illegal immigrants overwhelmingly have modest levels of education. The vast majority either didn't graduate high school in their home country or have only the equivalent of a high school education. There is also agreement that immigrants who come to America with modest levels of education, regardless of legal status, create more in cost for government than they pay in taxes. Now, taking the likely education level of illegal border crossers and combining them with the net fiscal estimates from that National Academies study shows that on balance, if you take all the taxes that they're likely to pay in their lifetime, given their education levels, and all the services and costs they create, there is a net drain on taxpayers of about $75,000 per illegal border crosser or about $7.5 billion per hundred thousand illegal border crosser. This figure is only for the original illegal immigrant. It doesn't count their descendants. We can do that. That's also in the study from the Academies. If we apply those estimates, then the cost would rise to about $94 billion per illegal immigrant and their descendants, or about $9.4 billion per 100,000. Now, to be clear, the fiscal costs of illegal immigrants is not due to the fact that they don't want to work. It's not even due to the fact that many work off the books. Rather, it reflects their educational attainment. In the modern American economy, people with this skill profile, native-born, immigrant, or--legal immigrant or illegal immigrant, pay less in taxes than they use in services. There's pretty much absolute agreement on that. Now, what these cost estimates do is give us an idea not only of what illegal border crossers cost, but they let us evaluate the likely savings that different enforcement strategies create for taxpayers versus what these enforcement strategies might cost. So, for example, a newly released study by the Institute for Defense Analyses indicates that perhaps 1.7 million new illegal immigrants will successfully cross our border in the next 10 years. Now, if that's the case, and no one knows what the future holds of course, but if that were to happen, and given these costs, it means that if we were to stop just 9 to 12 percent of those expected crossers over the next decade, it would generate $12-$15 billion in savings, which might be enough to pay for a wall. In effect, the wall could pay for itself even if it only kept out a small fraction of the people expected to come. Now, recently, the Cato Institute evaluated my analysis, and they argued that the illegal immigrants weren't as unskilled as I thought they were based on my analysis of the data. But even so, they still found that the average illegal border crosser would pay 43--creates a fiscal deficit of $43,000 or $4.3 billion per hundred thousand illegal crosser. Now, Cato in their analysis also tries to argue that State and local government costs, which are in the National Academies studies, shouldn't count because it's the Federal Government that is building the wall. Now, this argument doesn't make sense to me but ultimately that's up to Congress whether to count the State and local costs, but it seems reasonable to me to do so. Now, finally, I just want to make one more point about the costs that come from the National Academies. They employ a concept called net present value, which calculates the fiscal impact, but this concept, which is commonly used by economists, has the effect of reducing the size of the drain that unskilled immigrants will create because it discounts the costs in the future. If you didn't do that discounting, the costs are much higher, about roughly double, about $150,000. So if you want to do a different calculation where you don't discount the future, that's what you would get. But the bottom line from this analysis is that unskilled immigration, which characterizes most illegal immigration, is very costly to taxpayers given their education and given the realities of the modern American economy that pays the less educated relatively low wages, coupled with the existence of a large and well-developed administrative state. It's not--the fiscal costs they create is not a moral defect on their part. It's simply the reality of education. Thank you for allowing me to testify, and I look forward to your questions. [Prepared statement of Mr. Camarota follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. DeSantis. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Judd for five minutes. STATEMENT OF BRANDON JUDD Mr. Judd. Chairman DeSantis, Congressman DeSaulnier, I appreciate the opportunity to be here today. In the--I want to emphasize first off I will not advocate for 2,000 miles' worth of border. That is just not necessary. But what I will advocate for is a border wall in strategic locations, which helps us secure the border. I want to point out what happened and give you a historical analysis of why the border is unsecure today. In the mid-'80s, the United States faced its first illegal immigration crisis. The Border Patrol had approximately 4,000 agents who were charged with patrolling nearly 2,000 miles of the United States-Mexico international border. Other than barbed wire fences owned by ranchers, there were no vehicle or pedestrian barriers to impede illegal border crossers. The Border Patrol was overwhelmed, and Congress chose to deal with the influx of illegal aliens entering the United States by passing the Immigration and Reform Act of 1986. The act promised to secure the border and ensure the United States was never put in the same situation again. The act failed. It failed in large part because the United States government put the cart before the horse. Without securing the border first, the government legalized several million persons who willfully violated U.S. law. By so doing, we broadcast a clear message to the world that our laws could be made void if enough people entered the country illegally. The message was heard worldwide, and illegal immigration exploded. After of IRCA of 1986, illegal border crossings in high numbers took place almost exclusively in San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. The Border Patrol thought if it could control these two corridors, they would be able to control illegal immigration and narcotics smuggling. They threw the vast majority of their resources at these areas but left other areas like the El Centro, California; the Yuma, Arizona; and the Tucson, Arizona, Border Patrol sectors wide open. The prevailing thought was that the infrastructure did not exist on either side of the border to allow smuggling organizations to move their operations to the inhospitable and barren desert areas of Arizona. The prevailing thought was wrong. For more than 10 years, the Tucson Border Patrol sector was overrun because we did not have the foresight to realize that smuggling is big business and that the cartels are extremely flexible and adaptable. In essence, we created the problem in Tucson, and the citizens and ranchers paid for our mistakes. Unlike today, in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, ISIS didn't exist, criminal cartels didn't control every facet of illegal activity on the border, and transnational gangs weren't prevalent in the United States. Today, however, this is our reality. And if we refuse to learn from failed border security policy and operations of the past, we will never secure the border. We must take a proactive approach, and it must start with the proper mix of technology, infrastructure, and manpower, and it must be comprehensive. We must acknowledge that shutting down the Rio Grande Valley sector without addressing Laredo, Del Rio, and Big Bend will just create the same type of vacuum that we created in Arizona. Part of the proper infrastructure, the wall, is being heavily debated, and as an agent who worked in two of the busiest sectors in the history of the Border Patrol, I can personally tell you how effective border barriers are. When I got to the Tucson sector, we had next to nothing by way of infrastructure, and I can confidently say that for every illegal border crosser that I apprehended, three got away. The building of barriers and large fences, a bipartisan effort, allowed agents in part to dictate where illegal crossings took place and doubled how effective I was able to be in apprehending illegal border crossers. As an agent who has extensive experience working with and without border barriers and as the person elected to represent rank-and-file Border Patrol agents, I can personally attest to how effective a wall, in strategic locations, will be. I implore both sides of the aisle to quit politicizing border security and illegal border entries and work with the men and women of the United States Border Patrol by providing the proper technology, infrastructure, and manpower. By so doing, Border Patrol agents will secure the border. I appreciate your time and look forward to answering all of your questions. Thank you. [Prepared statement of Mr. Judd follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. DeSantis. I thank the gentleman. Ms. Espinoza, you are up for five minutes. STATEMENT OF MARIA ESPINOZA Ms. Espinoza. Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the committee, I am honored to be here before you today to testify on issues associated with national security. My name is Maria Espinoza. My testimony is based upon my nearly eight years of traveling across the country with the Remembrance Project, an organization that advocates for those families, our country's previously most forgotten, whose loved ones were killed by illegal aliens. My testimony is designed to assist you and others to understand the urgency of the immediate need to secure our country. Americans will continue to be under assault until the wall is built and the border secured. I have attended murder trials, criminal and civil hearings, testified in other States, and participated in roundtable discussions with sheriffs. I have made presentations and have spoken with groups all over the United States about the most devastating of all impacts of illegal immigration, the loss of a life. I have had hundreds of firsthand experiences with many Stolen Lives families. For nearly 20 years, families of Americans slain by illegal aliens have given heart-wrenching congressional testimony like the one you're about to hear from Mrs. Gibboney about the tragic and violent killings of loved ones perpetrated by someone who should not have been in the country in the first place. The irony, while it seemed as though the politicians listened and even publicly gave the families their condolences, congressional leadership, the bodies of both houses, Democrat and Republican, have failed to enact the very measures that would have saved American lives. America has spoken. We want the wall built right away. Today, I speak on behalf of the Remembrance Project Advocacy, Incorporated, where we proudly support our President and an America-first national agenda. The wall is a foundation upon which a comprehensive border policy can and must be built. It is of the utmost urgency. First, for a future perspective on the horrors of a national open-borders policy, let's look at Texas over the past six years. According to Department of Homeland Security status indicators, over 217,000 criminal aliens have been booked into local Texas jails between 2011 and 2017, committing nearly 600,000 crimes ranging from assault of which there were nearly 70,000, to over 6,000 violent sexual assaults of women and children and homicides which number nearly 1,200, all preventable. These are only a sampling of the heinous crimes they have committed. Department of Homeland Security reports that a full two out of three of these crimes were committed by aliens here illegally. Those who falsely state that a great border wall would not work either don't know their history or are in denial. To those border wall naysayers, doubters, and deniers, I can assure you that a wall will work. Today, where walls exist on our own southern border, illegal crossings have been drastically reduced by over 94 percent. In the Arizona Yuma sector, arrests of illegal alien crossings dwindled from over 138,000 to just over 8,300. The known attempts to enter and those who escape dwindled to an equally minimal number compared to the hundreds of thousands who entered and evaded arrests in previous years. Yes, your honorable committee men and women, walls do work. To falter now has dire future consequences to Americans and America's future. If not built when another open-borders President is elected, the technological deterrence and all- important army of border agents will be reduced or entirely removed allowing this holocaust of American killings to resume. This unwise policy must not be allowed to be perpetrated upon our families. Based upon preliminary information, we believe that the American Stolen Lives may number in the tens of thousands, but because the government at every level has previously failed to identify correctly the illegal alien killers, no one knows for sure. We welcome Congress' commitment to assure an accurate accounting and believe that all Americans, if they knew the true human cost of this invasion, would demand the wall be built immediately. Just last month, there was a string of reports of heinous crimes committed by illegal alien gang members. The Remembrance Project Advocacy stands behind President Trump with the American people in demanding that Congress immediately fund the construction of the wall. All of you here today and all of Congress bear a duty not just to your constituents but to all Americans to preserve our sovereign nation and keep our communities safe by first and foremost securing our borders. I ask you to do all you can to stop these preventable killings and murders that permanently separated families from their loved ones. Please, not one more stolen life. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. [Prepared statement of Ms. Espinoza follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. DeSantis. Thank you. Ms. Gibboney, you are up for five minutes. STATEMENT OF AGNES GIBBONEY Ms. Gibboney. Thank you for inviting me here today. My name is Agnes Gibboney. I was born in Budapest, Hungary. I was two when my family left in January of 1957 as refugees. We immigrated to Brazil where we lived for 13 years legally trying to apply to come to the United States. My parents, my brother, myself legally immigrated to the United States. We followed all the rules, the laws. We followed all the background investigation, thorough background investigation and thorough medical exams by American Consulate appointed and approved doctors. We also had to have character witnesses attesting that we had good moral standing, and my father was required to have a job contract. Today, April 27 marks my son Ronald da Silva's 15th anniversary of his murder. Ronald was my first born, my only son. His father, my first husband, was a Brazilian national. Ronald was a good person, kind, considerate, respectful, loving, funny, and sometimes a practical joker. He helped my parents, and Ronald was a good big brother to his two sisters. He was always there when anyone needed his help. Ronald went to visit his two children, Matthew and Marcel, and while standing on the driveway, he was shot, a bullet that was intended for someone else. The shooter, the murderer, was an illegal alien with a long criminal record who had been previously deported. Immediately after the shooting, he fled to Mexico. His wife was depositing her welfare check at the credit union so he could withdraw it in Tijuana so he can live on it. He eventually turned himself--returned to the United States, and was sent to prison. He's due to be released in two years and seven months. I am afraid that California won't notify ICE of his pending release. It took me almost 11 years to find out he had an ICE hold. Our borders would have been--if our borders would have been secured, Ronald would still be here, along with thousands of innocent victims killed by illegal aliens. Many criminal illegal aliens deported return to our unsecured borders to continue victimizing American citizens. One life lost is one too many. We need a barrier, we need a wall, and more Border Patrol officers to protect us all. Ronald's murder devastated my family. My only sibling, my brother Laszlo, had a massive stroke at age 51 due to the overwhelming stress and despair. He died the following day only four months after Ronald was murdered. You see, my brother was married to my sister-in-law, who is from Mexico, and that devastated them. My father gave up living. He wanted to die to be with Ronald, his first grandchild. It took him 11 years of suffering. My mother tried to be so hard and strong for me and the family. She was our rock, but I could see the incredible pain in her eyes. She, too, is in Heaven now and they are together, my son, my brother, father, and mother. I have never seen my husband Mark, a highly educated man, retired deputy chief of El Monte PD where my son was murdered, so helpless. Watching the devastation, the panic, the pain, there was nothing he could do to undo or fix what happened. He was the one to call me at the campground where I was camping with my two daughters with Girl Scouts to tell me that Ronald was shot in the shoulder and he was expected to survive. We immediately drove home. As I walked in the house, he hugged me and said I am sorry. I told him I was going to the hospital to be with Ronald so when he came out of surgery, he wouldn't be alone. It was then that he said I'm sorry, Ronald didn't make it. Now, I live a life sentence of pain and suffering wondering what would Ronald look like? Would he have gray hair at age 44? Would he be married? Would he--what would he be doing? I miss his beautiful smile, his warm bear hugs, his sense of humor, our talks. I miss his voice, his scent. I miss family get- togethers with all of us present. My family is permanently broken and separated. I can't travel anywhere in the world to see him ever again. I will forever miss all the tomorrows and all that was taken from me, all because of broken open borders. I miss watching him iron his clothes and spend a long time fixing his hair, but what I miss the most is him calling me mommy. I miss everything. I simply miss my son. All I have left are his clothes, old photos, baby shoes, baby bottles, some toys and memories. I live with this emptiness, a hole in my heart longing for my son, and I live with the daily fear of losing another child or family member. We cannot afford to lose one more life. Ronald is just one life. His death is not an isolated case. Deputy David March, murdered a couple days after Ronald in a neighboring town, his murderer also fled to Mexico and he also had been previously deported. His widow Teri and I became friends. We would compare our pain, our hurt, our grief, and often cry together. Officer Don Johnston, a coworker of my husband, was shot by someone who overstayed his visa. He became paraplegic. He ultimately died of his injuries. Hundreds of victims' innocent lives. I wonder how many more are there that we don't know about because our government does not keep statistics on illegal aliens' crimes. What an overall problem it is for a nation that so many U.S. citizens are killed on a daily basis by illegal aliens who shouldn't be in our country to begin with. When I became a U.S. citizen, the first President I voted for was President Ronald Reagan, who signed an amnesty bill which was supposed to be followed by securing our borders and enforcing immigration laws within our country, including verifying rights to employment. These things have never been done, and the conditions have gotten worse every year. The irony is my family and I legally immigrated to the United States and an illegal murdered my son who should have never been in the country to begin with. I urge you to do what so many politicians have promised for years: a secure border. Eliminate incentives for illegal aliens to come here, and enforcement of existing immigration laws. It is too late for my son Ronald and the thousands killed by illegal aliens, but there are so many lives that can be saved if you would just take action and put Americans first. Our President Donald Trump deserves more respect. He is working so hard to protect our country, protect our Constitution. Illegal aliens have no constitutional rights. A country without border is no country. You may say that it is inhumane to deport illegal aliens who didn't care about breaking our laws. How inhumane is it that my son Ronald and thousands of innocent victims' lives were cut short? It is the responsibility of the government to keep us safe, and our President Trump is working to accomplish that. Please do not stand in his way. Work with him. Thank you for your time. [Prepared statement of Ms. Gibboney follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. DeSantis. Thank you. Mr. Stodder, you are up for five minutes. STATEMENT OF SETH STODDER Mr. Stodder. Thank you so much. Chairman DeSantis, Representative DeSaulnier, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify today to present my views on the administration's proposed wall across the U.S.-Mexico border. I've been around this issue for a while, having served in senior law enforcement and Homeland Security positions in both the Bush administration, as well as the Obama administration. And in my view, President Trump's proposal to build a wall across the entire U.S.-Mexico border is deeply misguided and Congress should not support it. Building a wall would be a massive waste of billions of taxpayer dollars and unfortunately we'll get very little in return because the wall won't help us address any of the most pressing challenges we face at the border. In fact, it will actually make us less safe. This is for several reasons. First, the wall attacks the wrong problem: the fear that America is somehow being overwhelmed by massive numbers of Mexican economic migrants seeking to cross the Rio Grande to take our jobs. This is an old, outdated talking point from the 1990s. While of course illegal Mexican migration still occurs, the reality is that the Border Patrol apprehensions are at historic lows. It's true that in the 1990s the border was out of control with illegal entries from Mexico approaching two million a year, but since then, we've dramatically strengthened enforcement and brought far greater control to our border. We've tripled the size of the Border Patrol. We've deployed sensors and aerial drones. And yes, we have constructed hundreds of miles of fence in strategic locations, mostly in urban areas like the double layer fence in San Diego. This blend of enforcement efforts has been extraordinarily successful, making it far harder and more expensive for people to cross illegally. But it only tells part of the story. The other more important point is that Mexico is changing dramatically. Over the last two decades since NAFTA, Mexico has grown into the world's 11th-largest economy and our third- largest trading partner. There are good jobs in Mexico, and people are staying to take them. What's the result of all this? According to the Pew Research Center, more Mexicans now leave the United States and head north, and border apprehensions of Mexicans are the lowest in decades with overall apprehensions now 75 percent less than at the high watermark of 2000 when 1.6 million people were apprehended by the Border Patrol. Of course, some do still try to cross and some do get in. Border enforcement will never be perfect in the same way that even the best urban police forces will never be able to prevent all crime. But the reality is that the investments this Congress and the administrations of both parties have made in securing the border have paid off. Our border with Mexico is far more secure than ever before. Now, this is not to suggest that we don't have pressing challenges at the border. We do. Unfortunately, a wall is not going to help us address any of them. First, the wall will not make us more secure against terrorism. There is little evidence of terrorists seeking to enter the United States across our Southwest border. One of the most important reasons for this is our close partnership with Mexico. We work together to share and analyze information on travelers for the Western Hemisphere so we can spot known or suspected terrorists before they get here far away from our Southwest border. If the fight over the wall poisons the security partnership with Mexico, it will make the American people less safe. Second, the wall will not stem the flow of illegal drugs. This is for the simple reason that drugs for the most part are smuggled into our country in the thousands of cars and trucks that enter our official ports of entry such as San Isidro. No one is proposing that we build a wall across Interstate 5 or block all trade or travel with Mexico, and a wall won't stop drugs from being smuggled through tunnels or by aircraft. Third, a wall will not help us fight the drug cartels. Most senior cartel leaders don't travel to the U.S., but if they do, they don't wander across the Sonoran Desert. But if Mexico reduces its cooperation with ICE and DEA in retaliation for our effort to build that wall, it will be far more difficult for us to successfully build cases against key figures or locate them for arrest in Mexico. And finally, the wall will not help us address the most pressing migration challenge we face, which stems from the crisis in Central America with thousands of Guatemalan, El Salvadoran, and Honduran families fleeing violence, extreme poverty, and environmental crises and coming to our border to seek asylum here. Most of these migrants are coming to our ports of entry or voluntarily turning themselves in to Border Patrol agents between the ports of entry in order to claim asylum. Under U.S. international law, we can't just build a wall and bounce them off. We must allow credible asylum claims to be heard in our immigration courts, and a wall will only channel those claims to the ports of entry. It won't prevent them from coming in the first place. So a wall is not going to help us with any of the most pressing challenges we face at the border. Back in the 1970s, Senator Proxmire used to hand out what he called the Golden fleece award to highlight wasteful Federal spending. I can't think of any program that would make Senator Proxmire more proud than the border wall, the ultimate golden fleece of the American taxpayers with the billions going to contractors seeking to build a wall that will provide no security benefit to the American people. Republican Representative Will Hurd puts it well. ``Building a wall is the most expensive and least-effective way to secure the border.'' That's sad enough, but even sadder is that the effort to build a wall will divert resources away from measures that will actually help address the priority challenges at the border. Our immigration system is indeed in crisis, straining from the flow of Central American asylum- seekers. We need more resources specifically devoted to addressing this challenge, and in the questioning, I'm happy to give my thoughts on that. But suffice it to say a wall's not going to help, nor will it make us safer from terrorism or organized crime. The wall is an extremely bad idea, and I hope Congress does not support it. Thank you. [Prepared statement of Mr. Stodder follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. DeSantis. I thank the gentleman. I will now recognize myself for five minutes. One of the frustrating things with this issue is just it has been a failure theater in this country for over 30 years. I mean, Mr. Judd, you have mentioned it. Ms. Gibboney, the 1986 amnesty, we are going to do an amnesty bill, secure the border, no more illegal immigration. That is going to be a thing of the past. And illegal immigration quadrupled between then and now in terms of the numbers that are here. In 1996 we were supposed to have an entry-exit visa system implemented, and that is different than this wall issue but there are millions of people who come legally and overstay their visa. To this day, we do not have an entry-exit visa system. And then in 2006 with the support of people like Senator Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Secure Fence Act, which was supposed to provide 700 miles of double-layered fencing. And in areas where that has been done, it has been very effective, and yet Congress immediately gutted the next year, and we have had about I think 36 miles total. And so we have got to get it right. We have been toiling with this for decades. Let's get it right and let's do it. Now, Mr. Camarota, the examples of Israel and San Diego suggest that if you do effective fencing or a wall, that that could actually reduce illegal immigration much more than your estimate. So do you agree--you took a very conservative estimate about how a wall--how much illegal immigration a wall would prevent. Mr. Camarota. Yes, I think it is pretty conservative. The experience with walls is that they do work where they are but where they're not, people tend to go around them. And there are, as you say, visa overstays, which is a very important question. But where they are, yes, they work quite effectively. That's for sure. Mr. DeSantis. Now, the strain on the taxpayer of people who come illegally, their medical costs that get borne by the taxpayer usually? Mr. Camarota. Right. That can often happen. People go up to emergency rooms or otherwise free clinics so that's a big area of cost. Mr. DeSantis. Education costs? Mr. Camarota. Education is another one. We spend about $17,000 on each child in the United States very, very roughly and have may be over a million illegal immigrant children in U.S. schools. Mr. DeSantis. And then law enforcement people say, well, people who come illegally don't necessarily commit crimes at a higher or lower level, and I don't know if that is true, but even if it is, that is taxing law enforcement, correct, because those would be people if the border was secured, that law enforcement wouldn't have to worry about it all, correct? Mr. Camarota. Perfectly reasonable. The data is all over the place on that. It's not clear whether illegals have a higher crime rate. But I think as we've heard today, that's really not the point, is it? If someone's not even supposed to be in the country and they kill someone, that is clearly preventable. And I think that's what frustrates the American people so much. Mr. DeSantis. Now, your study, it doesn't even take into account I don't think the noneconomic costs associated with having a porous border and allowing illegal immigration. I mean, you know, drugs, human trafficking, obviously the crime as we have seen, that is not even reflected at all in your study, correct? Mr. Camarota. No, I didn't include any of the costs for the children of illegal immigrants, too. Mr. DeSantis. Okay. So there is clearly--I think with the victims we have seen, I mean, there is immense cost to that goes with that. So you think that--your study, it is probably conservative in terms of the number of illegal entries that it could prevent, but it is also conservative in terms of some of the benefits because you would be talking about drugs, you would be talking about crime, you would be talking about reducing other bad things associated with having a porous border. Is that fair? Mr. Camarota. Yes, I think that's fair. I mean, look, a lot of these things you can't put a dollar amount on ---- Mr. DeSantis. Now ---- Mr. Camarota.--as we have heard. Mr. DeSantis.--in terms of paying for it, are there ways, whether it is what Senator Cruz suggested by taking the seized drug asset money, which is billions and billions of dollars, others have said take some of the illegally obtained refundable tax credits by, you know, that is $7-8 billion I think you could save. So do you agree there are ways where that money can be identified and used that don't necessarily involve just having the American taxpayer pay for it directly? Mr. Camarota. Yes. You've mentioned two. The other is the tax remittances that flow out of the United States, tens of billions of dollars. Put a tax on them and you could generate income as well. Mr. DeSantis. Now, Mr. Judd, I think you agree that when you have areas where these barriers have been effective like San Diego, obviously the bread and butter is still going to be you guys out there, but it really is a force multiplier because one of your agents can then cover a much larger territory if you do have that barrier. Is that right? Mr. Judd. With a barrier, it's estimated that all we need is one agent per three, four linear miles. Without a barrier, I need one agent per linear mile. So the cost effectiveness of a barrier in manpower is--it's extremely successful. So, yes, we need to--we absolutely need to look at where we have to put the wall, and it will allow us to dictate where crossings take place and allow us to be more effective. Mr. DeSantis. And the Secure Fence Act had 700 miles out of the 2,000. Do you think that makes sense? Is that probably enough? I don't think anyone is saying you need 2,000 miles, correct? Mr. Judd. I do. In fact, Chief Ron Vitiello recently came out and said the exact same thing that I've been saying for two years, that we need it in strategic locations. And again, that 700 miles is about what it is. Mr. DeSantis. Now, you are critic of the catch-and-release policies of the Obama administration it is fair to say? Mr. Judd. Yes. Mr. DeSantis. So doing a lot of things, we need to support you is important, but you can do all those things, and if there is an administration and power that doesn't really have the will or that ties your hands behind your back, then you can have the best of intentions. It is going to be difficult to get this problem right. Is that accurate? Mr. Judd. It is. And what's extremely frustrating is to cross the border at a place other than a port of entry, that's a crime. When we see these individuals, what we're effectively doing through the catch-and-release program, we're driving the criminal smuggling organizations and we're incentivizing them to allow these individuals to cross the border at places other than ports of entry. Every single one of these individuals could legally present themselves at a port of entry, but it's the smugglers who are forcing them to cross at places other than a port of entry, which then puts extreme pressure on us, and it takes people out of the field, which then opens up holes that allows smugglers to bring across even higher cost value traffic such as heroin and potentially even people from Middle Eastern countries. So it's a huge problem. Mr. DeSantis. So you think in terms of the issues with not having a secure border, I mean, you think the drugs--you do think drugs are coming across illegally and that's a major issue? Mr. Judd. I know they are. And in fact, if we really think that more drugs are coming across the ports of entry, we're absolutely wrong. All you have to do is pull agents out of the field, and that's what smugglers are doing by crossing these family units that are coming over here and asking for asylum. What we're doing is we're creating holes and we're allowing the smugglers to bring across their higher-value products such as heroin. Mr. DeSantis. Ms. Gibboney, thank you for your testimony. And this is something that is very personal to you to get this border under control, correct? Ms. Gibboney. Absolutely. Mr. DeSantis. And I think you have said before that you would be happy to take your own shovel and work to build it even in the 120-degree heat? Ms. Gibboney. I was just going to say that. Yes, I would be happy to go and work on the wall myself. I know it's not feasible, but trust me, I would be there. Mr. DeSantis. And that is because you don't want to see anyone else to be in your shoes someday? Ms. Gibboney. Never. I--it's such a pain. It's so difficult, especially days like today that I don't even wish it upon the guy that murdered my son. I don't wish this pain on his family. That's how painful. I mean, you would think that I would wish him a lot of harm. I don't. But nobody should have to suffer through something like this because if my son would have been sick, I would have resigned myself that it was his time to go, that it was God's wishes. But my son's life was cowardly taken. Mr. DeSantis. And I think you also mentioned in your testimony, and this is going to be an issue that we are going to have to come on in a different hearing I think, but your son's murderer is in prison, will eventually get out. You are worried that California may not notify ICE. And, you know, we have had Jamiel Shaw here, who is also from California. You probably know Jamiel. Ms. Gibboney. Yes. Mr. DeSantis. And, you know, you had, you know, illegal aliens, they were involved in criminal activity, released by the State, and then murdered Jamiel Shaw. We had Casey Chadwick, her mother here last year, who you had a guy from Haiti who is illegally in the country, served a sentence for manslaughter. I think it was 12, 13 years. Connecticut, ICE did not send him back, released, and then he killed Casey. So that is going to be an issue I think that we are going to have to get right because if you know someone has already served a sentence, they are not here legally, releasing them into society to me puts the American people in grave risk. And so I think you are right to be concerned about it. We want to work with you to make sure that these States are working with ICE so that we are not letting dangerous people out. I have gone over my time and I will give indulgences to my friend from California and I will recognize him now. Ms. Gibboney. Thank you. Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I would really--in Mr. Judd's comments earlier and to the degree you can help us with this and your members, it would be wonderful if we could get, knowing the passion involved--and I don't want to put words in your mouth, but your original testimony to depoliticize as much as possible. Having spent a good deal of time when I was in the State Legislature in California researching public works projects that are so-called mega-projects, that is any project over $1 billion, they are just fraught with concerns from an implementation standpoint, your point about where it is. So it would be my wish that perhaps as an opportunity for us in a dispassionate, nonpartisan way look at just the engineering and from the security experts the best return on investment. And to that regard it has to be at least considered where the money will come from, whether the money will come from other parts of Homeland Security or whether it will come from NIH, which has equally compelling parent stories about people losing their lives because we haven't invested there. So that is an overall context. First, Mr. Chairman, I would like unanimous consent to enter into the record the Cato report that Mr. Camarota referenced, not the most liberal organization in the world. The title of the report is ``The Border Wall Cannot Pay for Itself.'' So I would like to enter that into the record. Mr. DeSantis. Without objection. Mr. DeSaulnier. And, Ms. Gibboney, the comments about your concerns from California, having a good relationship and then being from California with the Governor's office and with the Attorney General and other public safety people, we have differences of opinion respectfully, but to the degree that it is appropriate, I would like to also work with the chairman to make sure that we communicate appropriately with you about the release of your son's perpetrator of that crime. So I'm happy to work with that with the difference that we have, some differences of opinion, but as appropriate, I would be happy to. Mr. Stodder, you have a lot of experience in this field, as I said earlier, in big public works projects, usually get a needs assessment, extensive peer-reviewed need assessment so you get risk assessments. You let the engineers do their job, tell them what the objective is. You let the experts like Mr. Judd and Homeland Security have their input. With your extensive experience, are we at that point yet to go ahead and make a judgment that this is--realizing there are dueling ideological think tanks that are offering their own perspective, including some that you would have an unexpected-- like the Cato Institute--view of it? Mr. Stodder. I think we're at a position right now to know for a fact that a Federal program like this will have massive cost overruns. We know that for a fact. We know that the wall, whatever the estimates, whether it's $15 billion, $22 billion, $70 billion, we actually have no idea what a wall would actually cost. The thing that I do know is that--I mean, I'm with Mr. Judd in the sense of I think the way to secure the border is to have the right blend of different things that we do, whether it be Border Patrol personnel, technology sensors and drones, fencing, also investigations as well, investigations of human smuggling networks and financial facilitators of those networks. You have to have a blend of all of them. And I think the fallacy I think of the wall is to think that, well, this is just one size that's going to fit all. We're just going to put a giant great wall across the southern border except for the ports of entry. So let's not forget the ports of entry and the stuff that comes in through the ports of entry. Mr. DeSaulnier. Mr. Stodder, though, my comment is just to the dispassionate analysis from law enforcement experts, Homeland Security experts, and engineers. Has there been any of the due diligence done that you would expect ---- Mr. Stodder. No, not that I'm ---- Mr. DeSaulnier.--for similar public works? Mr. Stodder. Not that I'm aware of. And I think it's something that absolutely need to be done. I mean, it needs--we need to focus--I think we need to get the pros from the Border Patrol and from ICE and others together to sort of thing through what's the right blend in any particular sector area. And, I mean, I'm not a person that would say--I mean, I am as strongly enforcement-oriented as the next person, having served in both Bush and Obama. I just don't--I think--and it could be that additional fencing is required in certain areas in strategic locations. It did a world of good in San Diego certainly. But I just think the idea of putting a wall across the entire border I think without further deeper analysis is misguided. Mr. DeSaulnier. Okay. I have got two quick quotes from you that I want you to respond to, both about the sentiment expressed here in these quotes in regards to illegal immigration and drug enforcement. Homeland Security John Kelly recently stated that a threat against aviation, quote, ``keeps me literally awake at night,'' yet President Trump has proposed cutting the Transportation Security Administration budget, including a program that supports local police at airports. The other quote that I would like you to respond to is in February Vice Admiral Charles Ray of the Coast Guard's deputy commander of operations stated, quote, ``As a result of lack of resources last year, we were prevented from getting over 580 known smuggling events, and those shipments made their way north.'' So could you respond to those two quotes? Mr. Stodder. Sure. Let me take them in reverse order, first with Charlie Ray, who I know well, good guy. I think - I mean, the idea of cutting the Coast Guard in order to build a wall is kind of insane because when you think about it from the perspective that we always thought--in Homeland Security we think about the three borders in the United States, so northern border, southern border, and the Caribbean border. And the more we reduce the resource availability of the Coast Guard, we are opening ourselves up to mass migrations from Haiti, from Cuba, and also for a shift in drug trafficking from the current place where it is, which is the U.S.-Mexican border back to the days of the 1980s and the '90s of movements through the Caribbean. So we have to make sure that the Coast Guard is adequately resourced to handle our third border. With regard to TSA, I mean, the cuts to TSA--I mean, I'm the first one to admit that, you know, certainly TSA requires some, you know, evaluations to sort of determine, you know, where it spends its money, but yes, the reduction of expenditure on the VIPR teams to help State and local law enforcement not only in airports but also surface transportation is perhaps unwise. Mr. DeSaulnier. And just a concluding comment, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Cummings can speak to this with more expertise than me, but having spent some experience on this, it is always dangerous I think for us in elected office, irrespective of party, to jump to conclusions about criminality and how to stop it. That needs to be evidence-based. We have some bipartisan agreements on that in other fields. I would suggest that this is one of those opportunities, to be driven by evidence-based research in addition to the engineering aspects of this project, that it is thoroughly peer-reviewed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. DeSantis. Thank you. I ask unanimous consent to wave on Mr. Grothman from Wisconsin. He is not a member of the subcommittee and he wanted to participate there. Without objection, so ordered. The chair will now recognize Mr. Comer for five minutes. Mr. Comer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I have to say that during the two-week recess I spent the whole time traveling the district, I have a very wide district, very rural, six hours from east to west in my district in southern Kentucky. I had 10 town halls and I don't know how many meetings and how many conversations with people, and the wall always came up. And there is overwhelming support in my district to build the wall, and that is something that people expect to get done in the very near future. So I had a couple questions first for Mr. Judd. Would the border wall have mitigated the terrible opioid epidemic we are seeing sweep across America, especially in my rural district in Kentucky? Mr. Judd. It absolutely will because, again, we will then dictate where illegal border crossings take place if we build the wall. Mr. Comer. How many criminal gang members have crossed into the U.S. in the past five years? And do you think the border wall could have reduced that number? Mr. Judd. I don't think it could; I know it could. When we catch these individuals that are coming here and asking for asylum, one of the biggest problems that we face is when we have them in the detention facilities, they're actually recruiting--while they're in our custody they're recruiting other individuals to join their gangs, and that's an extreme concern. Mr. Comer. Mr. Judd, I saw in the newspaper, the Senate Democrats assume a per-mile cost of $36.6 million per mile. Do you agree with that cost estimate? Mr. Judd. I don't. I'm not an expert on what the cost will be. I can just tell you how effective it will be. But what I can tell you is that 9/11 cost the government trillions of dollars. We have to--$1 billion, that's a drop in the bucket compared to what happened on 9/11. Mr. Comer. Obviously that is a concern of every taxpayer and every person that has any type of conservatism is the cost. When you look at the total cost, will all areas of the southern border require new fencing, as some of the opponents have claimed? Mr. Judd. It will. It will. We are--to build a proper wall--I'm an advocate of fencing, and again, I'm--it was a bipartisan effort to pass that. But the problem with fencing is it's defeatable. I can bring up a welding torch and I can cut holes in the fence. In fact, that's what happens. I have a brother who's also a Border Patrol agent who spent two years and all he did every day was patched holes in the fence. And so a wall is--cannot be defeated the way a fence can be defeated. Mr. Comer. What other factors--I guess this is for anyone on the panel. What other factors could have an impact on the total cost of the border wall? Are there things that can be done to build the wall cheaper where we still have the maximum- security impact? Or what other factors would impact the cost or could impact the cost? Anybody? Mr. Camarota. Well, I mean, obviously one of the key questions is what are the most vital areas, right? There's parts of the border that are not likely to become major smuggling routes, at least for individuals, so we don't need a wall or even a lot of fencing there, maybe just a vehicle barrier. So I certainly don't think that we need a giant wall across the whole border. That's not my position. My position is that there are places where a wall and fencing barriers are vitally important and we don't have them. And we've authorized it in the past. It just--that seems crazy to me. And so I think that's where we should start at the very least. Mr. Judd. To address your question, one of the things that I have been impressed with--and again, this is not trying to take a political stance. I'm independent myself. But one thing that I have been impressed with is I've had the opportunity to meet with President Trump face-to-face on four occasions. I've had a telephonic conversation with him specifically about this issue. And one of the things is is, yes, he's come in with preconceived notions, but one thing that I have been very impressed with was, as a businessman, he has been willing to listen to the experts and what they've had to say. Now, what his ultimate decision is going to be I don't know, but I have had the opportunity to let him know that it's not 2,000 miles' worth of wall. It's strategic locations. And he's been open to that idea. So I'm hoping that's in fact where he goes because that will drive the cost way down. Mr. Comer. That's great. Mr. Stodder. One thing just to add to that a little bit is the--I mean, the unpredictable factors in terms of how you construct a wall like this or even fencing in areas is environmental issues, private lands, all kinds of litigation that could come out of this. I mean, I think we shouldn't--I mean, in any big project like that we cannot be Pollyannaish about how much this is going to cost and how long it's going to take because of the other factors that could go into it. Mr. Comer. And I have huge concerns about the private property aspects of it, so I would agree with that. But my time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. DeSantis. I thank the gentleman. The chair now recognizes Mrs. Demings for five minutes. Mrs. Demings. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for having this very important hearing. First of all, I want to just say to Ms. Gibboney how sorry I am for your loss. I am the mother of three sons, and I can't imagine what it would be like to not have those hugs and talks and interaction with them, so I'm so sorry ---- Ms. Gibboney. Thank you. Mrs. Demings.--for your loss. I spent 27 years in law enforcement at the Orlando Police Department, and I can tell you, as a 27-year veteran, I have worked my share of homicides, aggravated assaults, rapes, child molestations, kidnappings, more than I care to admit. And I wish that I could've simply put up a wall to stop it because I would have done that. A question that came up earlier, what I can also tell you without hesitation is that the overwhelming majority of the people we arrested in those cases were not undocumented immigrants. And so the ranking member is absolutely correct that we do--as we keep America safe, it is my number one priority. We have to be careful that we are not generalizing a certain group of people from a certain place if we are committed to doing this correctly. Mr. Judd, I also want to thank you for your service. This is not a political issue. It is certainly not for me. I am going to believe that it is not for you. You talked about how important effective border barriers areas are, and just to kind of clear up this for me in my mind, Candidate Trump, when he talked about the walls, that it is going to be hard and concrete, made out of rebar and steel, and that is not the wall you support. Is that correct? Mr. Judd. Actually, I absolutely support a wall that can be--that is not defeatable. Again, I ---- Mrs. Demings. This wall, made out of steel, rebar ---- Mr. Judd. It cannot ---- Mrs. Demings.--and ---- Mr. Judd. It has to be a wall that cannot be defeated by welding torches. We face that problem on a daily basis today, so yes, it has to be an impenetrable wall as far as ---- Mrs. Demings. So you would support a wall that was 2,000 miles ---- Mr. Judd. No. Mrs. Demings.--a concrete wall ---- Mr. Judd. Absolutely not. Mrs. Demings.--made out of steel and rebar? Mr. Judd. No. I support a wall in strategic locations, which will then allow us to dictate where illegal border crossings take place. Mrs. Demings. Okay. When you say us, who exactly are you referring to? Mr. Judd. The United States Border Patrol. Mrs. Demings. Okay. All right. Mr. Stodder, I understand of course that you have worked on border issues in the Department of Homeland Security for 15 years under two administrations. Thank you so much for your service as well. And you have stated that we have greatly improved our border security against the most pressing threats to public safety, including terrorism, transnational organized crime, and we have established far greater control over illegal immigration on our southwest border than in any other time over the last four decades. Can you explain in more detail--I don't think we can talk about it enough how we have greatly improved our border security, or in other words, what has changed? Mr. Stodder. Sure. Mrs. Demings. What did we not have four decades ago that we now do? Mr. Stodder. Yes, I mean I guess what I can speak to is since when I served in the Bush administration in the years after 9/11 and then also serving in the Obama administration, there's been a bipartisan consensus, both administrations and in Congress, to strengthen border enforcement. We have tripled the size of the Border Patrol. We have deployed sensors, aerial drones across the border. We have put fences, secure fences in important strategic locations in the border. Are more fences needed in different places? I don't doubt it. But I think that's a question for the local Border Patrol sector chiefs to determine in their particular areas of responsibility what the right mixture of personnel, technology, and infrastructure really is. The other thing is that I think ICE, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, has become far more effective in going after human smuggling organizations and going after their financial facilitators. So our investigative capabilities are also fairly strong. Now, here's the other thing that--I think to focus on here. Number one, with regard to Mexican immigration, you have to think in terms of the undocumented population in the United States, which is declining. It's around 11 million people right now down from about 12 million people 10 years ago. Less than half of the population now--it was just announced the other day--is Mexican. So that population is now mostly visa overstays. It's the--less than half is the Mexican population, and it's declining. The numbers of people who are coming across the border now--the Border Patrol is regularly apprehending about 400,000 people at the border every year down from 1.6 million when I started back in the first--in the Bush administration after 9/ 11. About half of those people are from Central America. So Central Americans who are coming up, and those folks either-- whether they're apprehended by the Border Patrol or by the Office of Field Operations at the port of entry, most of those folks are actually claiming asylum because they're coming from--they're fleeing violence or they're fleeing other difficulties in Central America or they've been told to do so by the smugglers. Some are legitimate, some are not, but all of them are entitled to a day in court in their immigration courts if they pass a credible fear screening and about 90-something percent of them pass credible fear. So what I would say is that we have become far more effective at policing the flow of people coming from Mexico. Mexico has changed economically so more people are staying home, fewer people are coming, but we still have serious problems. And the serious challenge that we're facing now in terms of migration is Central America. And that's straining our resources because people are claiming asylum, but there are 500,000-person backlogs in our immigration courts, and that's what causes CBP and ICE to have to release those folks into the United States pending their claims. So if we were to spend it--you know, the first billion dollars I would spend in border enforcement probably would be going towards the immigration courts to staff those courts so we can actually expeditiously and efficiently process asylum claims so we don't have to have people in the United States for the length of five, six, seven years that it takes often to process an asylum claim. And that would send a message to the smugglers I think to say this is not a free pass to come to the United States. Mrs. Demings. Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for the additional time. I yield back. Mr. DeSantis. You mentioned asylum. I mean, do you think that Congress needs to relook at how some of those statutes operate so that we can kind of not incentivize so many people to come in and make claims that really aren't meritorious? Mr. Stodder. It's a difficult question. I mean I think--I mean, the way the system works right now is that people--I mean, kids who come unaccompanied don't have to go through the credible fear screening; they just come in so--if they're coming from Central America, not from Mexico. But I mean the issue of whether credible fear should be looked at again I think is a difficult, tricky question because I think the reality is if--I mean, the stakes of being wrong, of a U.S. CIS Citizenship and Immigration Services officer being wrong in determining somebody does not have credible fear can result in certain circumstances of somebody going back to El Salvador or Honduras and being killed. So the stakes are high in terms of how we think about the credible fear test. Now, having said that, I think the statistics are of people coming from El Salvador and Honduras and to a lesser extent Guatemala, about 95 percent of them make it through credible fear screening ---- Mr. DeSantis. Okay Mr. Stodder.--and then the immigration court is 50 percent ---- Mr. DeSantis. Yes, let me recognize ---- Mr. Stodder. Yes. Mr. DeSantis.--Mr. Duncan for five minutes. Mr. Stodder. Sure. Mr. Duncan. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you most of all for the great job you do chairing this subcommittee. Let me just say, Ms. Gibboney, I have noticed that some Members of the Congress and many of these Saturday night comedians try to make jokes about the wall. It is not much of a joke to you, is it? Ms. Gibboney. No, it is not. It's--I don't see what's funny about it because they have not been affected personally because if they would, they would think differently also. Mr. Duncan. Well, I wish that everybody could have heard your testimony. I have always heard that the worst thing that can never happen to you is to outlive one of your children, and certainly you have our condolences. Let me say this. You know, some people imply or even say that if we try to enforce our immigration laws, that it is cruel or something is wrong with it, but, you know, I noticed in some of the staff material President Netanyahu of Israel, he said, ``President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration, great success, great idea.'' Somehow, he can do it and not be criticized, but if we try to do it, there is something wrong with it. And then also I noticed in the material that I have been given from the staff, I mean even Mr. Stodder said that a border works in certain strategic locations, and I think that makes a lot of sense to me. I know the material we have been given says that just before they built the first wall in San Diego there were approximately 700,000 apprehensions, and this last year it was down to 31,000. So a wall has been very, very effective there. You know, the situation is this. You know, there are two statistics that tell the whole story. With only 4 percent of the world's population, we buy almost 22 percent of the world's goods. We have a standard of living far beyond what anybody else has, so you certainly can understand why so many hundreds of millions, maybe even a couple of billion want to come here. And the second statistic is that is that 58 percent of the people in the world have to get by on $4 or less a day. I mean, most people in this country don't realize how blessed we are, how fortunate we are. And you can understand why so many people want to come here. And we sympathize with all these people. Americans are the kindest, most generous, most sympathetic people in the world, but we simply can't open our borders and just take in everybody who wants to come because our hospitals, our jails, our sewers, our schools, our roads, our whole infrastructure, and not to even mention our economy, we couldn't handle the rapid influx of people that would come here. And there is no other country that faces the problem that we face to the extent that we face it. And so it is not cruel. It is just common sense. And, Dr. Camarota, the staff says that there is a recent National Academy for Sciences' study that estimated the net fiscal drain of each illegal crosser was $74,722. Are you familiar with that study? Mr. Camarota. Yes. Let me be clear. What the National Academy did was calculate the drain or fiscal benefit depending if someone's very skilled ---- Mr. Duncan. Right. Mr. Camarota.--by education for each immigrant. So what I did was just apply that to the skill level of illegal immigrants to come up with an estimate how big it would be. So I took their estimates by education and looked at the education of the illegals and it comes to about $75,000 per illegal. Mr. Duncan. Then also we have been provided with figures that the IRS is paying out billions in improper payments to illegal immigrants every year through the use of refundable tax credits. Have you looked at that? Mr. Camarota. Yes, particularly the refundable portion of the additional child tax credit, the IRS a while ago made the determination that they could pay that out and they didn't have to worry so much about illegal status. So, yes, they are clearly paying hundreds of millions if not billions out to illegal immigrants. There's just--there's no question. It's also the case that they pay some out in the earned income tax credit ---- Mr. Duncan. Right. Mr. Camarota.--but less. Mr. Duncan. Well, final question, let me ask you this. For years we have seen this figure and even in the material that we have been given for this hearing, it says 11 million illegal immigrants. Almost everybody I talked to estimates that it is way more than that, way more. And we are really probably talking $20 or $30 million. But you have studied this in detail and I haven't. Tell me what you feel is the most accurate figure in that regard? Mr. Camarota. It's important to recognize that it is illegal and difficult to measure and there is a margin of error. But if you're asking me, I think it's $10 to $12 million. Could it be a little bit higher? Yes, it could be, but very briefly, the way we arrive at a number like that is we know about how many legal immigrants there should be in the United States, and then we look at the data the Census Bureau collects that identifies immigrants and then we subtract that out and we get a residual. And that number is about 10 million. And so then you think, well, maybe we're missing 10 percent based on some of the research, but it could be 20 percent. But you can see how it doesn't get up to $20 million. Is the Census Bureau data itself any good? I'm going to argue yes just because when we look at what the data shows us about school enrollment or we look at what the data shows us about birth, it pretty well lines up with administrative data. So I think that those estimates are right. Mr. Duncan. Let me stop you and ask ---- Mr. Camarota. Yes. Mr. Duncan.--one last thing. Mr. Camarota. Sure. Mr. Duncan. How many millions have we allowed to immigrate here legally over let's say the last 50 years? Mr. Camarota. Well, the total illegal--the total foreign- born is about 45, 46 million today in 2017 and about 10 or 12 of that is illegal. So there are about 33 million, 32 million legally people present in the United States who are foreign- born. Now, some have become citizens, but that total foreign- born ---- Mr. Duncan. Well ---- Mr. Camarota.--legal is about $32 million. Mr. Duncan. My point is that no other country in the world has even come close ---- Mr. Camarota. True. Mr. Duncan.--to allowing this many people to immigrate here legally as we have. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. DeSantis. I thank the gentleman. Time is expired. The chair will now recognize our guest from Wisconsin for five minutes. Mr. Grothman. Okay. I was going to do a follow-up but I will just ask you briefly. You are confident--how long has that 11 million figure been out there? How long if I would ask you or somebody in your position how many people are here illegally would we hear the 11 million figure? Mr. Camarota. Well, we think that it's been around that number for like eight years now because every year we take the American Community Survey or the current population survey and try to estimate it. Mr. Grothman. What was it in the year 2000? Mr. Camarota. I think the general estimate is somewhere around eight million. Mr. Grothman. I am not sure that is right but okay. I am going to ask you guys some questions as far as the overall cost. Is there any estimate out there the amount of money we are paying every year for health care for people who are here illegally? Mr. Camarota. Do you want to count like U.S.-born children or just the illegal immigrants? Because a lot of children of illegal immigrants are signed up for Medicaid, so that would be a big cost anyway, so you'd have to ---- Mr. Grothman. Give me either estimate. Mr. Camarota. It's several billion dollars a year for treatment for the uninsured because the illegal population makes up a large share of the uninsured. Mr. Grothman. Okay. Several billion, that would be, what, five billion? Mr. Camarota. Yes, that would be a perfectly ---- Mr. Grothman. Okay. I know it is difficult to get records-- are there any estimates that agree to which income-based transfer payments are going to people illegally? I hear anecdotal evidence from income maintenance workers in my district that they are getting people that are illegal coming here. Do we have an estimate on the total amount of what we call welfare benefits claims of people here illegally? Mr. Camarota. We do have some estimates. Remember that an illegal immigrant can collect benefits on behalf of a U.S.-born child. If we include that, then those numbers certainly run, you know, to over $10 billion if you count things like the U.S.-born child on Medicaid. A family, for example, can get food stamps even though the parents are illegal because the food stamps come in the name of the U.S.-born children. So there's a lot of that going on. Mr. Grothman. Don't you believe that there are a lot of people, even adults, who are signing up for benefits who may not be citizens? Mr. Camarota. May not be citizens? Mr. Grothman. I hear that. Mr. Camarota. Sure. There are a lot of legal immigrants who also access the welfare system. I mean, I could give you my estimates for those things. I don't have them right in front of me, but yes, legal immigrants make extensive ---- Mr. Grothman. How about illegal immigrants? Mr. Camarota. Illegal immigrants, yes. We know from the survey of income and program participation where they pretty well identify themselves as illegal based on some questions that more than half of all households headed by illegal immigrants have someone in that household signed up for some kinds of benefits, typically the non-cash programs. Mr. Grothman. Could you give me the total amount if you had to throw out a number there? Mr. Camarota. Total amount that illegal immigrants are receiving in income transfers, cash, and non-cash type stuff? Is that what ---- Mr. Grothman. Right, right. Mr. Camarota. Oh, you know, that would be well over $10 billion at least, more than that, most of it from the Federal Government. Mr. Grothman. And of course most of that is going to U.S. citizens ultimately, right? Mr. Camarota. Well, it depends on how you view it, right, because if you have a family getting food stamps, the parent certainly can feed themselves on those food stamps. Mr. Grothman. Okay. Mr. Camarota. If the family lives in public housing because they have one U.S.-born child, which is certainly allowed, then the parents are benefiting. So depends on how you want to calculate or view that. Mr. Grothman. But most systems don't cut off U.S.-citizen children from welfare benefits? Mr. Camarota. That's right, they don't, and that's why illegal immigrants can use those programs through their U.S.- born children. Mr. Grothman. It's hard to get the numbers. Do you know how many people in our criminal justice system, how many people in local jails, prisons are illegal immigrants? Do we have hard numbers on that? Mr. Camarota. Incomplete numbers. Mr. Grothman. Substantial? I mean, when I am talking to people who run these facilities, they think it is a significant situation even in Wisconsin, but do you have any estimates? Mr. Camarota. You may remember the Federal Government is paying out lots of money already through the SCAAP program so that might be a place to begin to look at what share of inmates ---- Mr. Grothman. Okay. Mr. Camarota.--in jails and prisons so it's big. Mr. Grothman. I will give you a question. Do you know what the age of consent is in other countries around the world? Mr. Camarota. I believe--I know it's less than U.S. I don't know ---- Mr. Grothman. Does anybody know about the age of consent is in Mexico, for example? Mr. Stodder, you have been involved in this area quite a while. Do you know? Mr. Stodder. I don't know the age of consent in Mexico. Mr. Grothman. That is shocking. Well, obviously, when we have people coming from another culture it is important, you know, they adapt to our culture. How long were you involved in this game, Mr. Stodder, that you don't know that? Mr. Stodder. The age of consent in Mexico? Mr. Grothman. Yes. Mr. Stodder. It's never been presented to me to know what the age of consent is in Mexico. I know that the age of consent in the United States is 18. Mr. Grothman. Well, it varies from State to State, but yes ---- Mr. Stodder. Yes, California. Mr. Grothman. They are 18 in some areas, 16 in others. Isn't it age 12 in many parts of Mexico? Do you view that as a potential problem when people come into this country, men come into this country and are used to living in a culture in which the age of consent is 12? Should people talk about that? Should people be educated about that? Mr. Stodder. What's the relevance of it? What are you driving at? Mr. Grothman. Well, I didn't--I am just saying ---- Mr. Judd. From a law-enforcement standpoint absolutely because what we're doing is we're taking people into our country--the people are coming into our country that have a different set of rules and they're trying to take those sets of rules and apply them here in the United States when that's wrong. Again, we're talking about illegal acts. We're not talking about legal acts. We're not talking about legal immigration. Mr. Grothman. Right. Mr. Judd. We're talking about illegal immigration. And when illegal aliens come to United States--and that's why Ms. Gibboney and Ms. Espinoza are here today is because these individuals come from countries that do not enforce their laws, and they come to the United States, and because they were allowed to break our laws, they think that they can break any law and they continue to perpetrate more crimes upon U.S. citizens. Mr. Grothman. And Mr. Stoddard can't figure it out but you see a danger in people coming to this country who don't know what our laws are with regard to the age of consent and may think the laws in this country are the same as the laws in other countries. And for those of us who care about women or young girls, we might view that as a concern. Mr. Judd. Well, we do. In fact, all you have to look at is what happened in the school in Virginia where that young girl was raped by two people who crossed the border illegally who were ultimately released under the catch-and-release program, which is why I'm so anti-against the catch-and-release program. But we see that people who break our laws willfully then try to apply their set of rules that they brought from their country into our own country, and that creates a huge drain on law enforcement. Mr. Grothman. Not just a physical drain but a drain on the certainly the victims. Certainly ---- Ms. Espinoza. Yes, and I do want to state also that not enforcing our laws encourages more breaking of the laws. And we certainly do not want to import more crime. Mr. Stodder. I don't think there's any evidence to indicate that kids under the age of 18, whatever their age, whatever the age of consent in their home country is, makes them more or less likely to commit crimes once they're here. I think the data is not there. I don't think that's what the data says. The one thing I will say about the age of consent that is important to think about, this Congress to think about is with regard to the Central American unaccompanied minors who are coming here, that when they--if they are under 18, if they're coming unaccompanied ---- Mr. Grothman. Yes, I am running out of my time here. I am well past my time and the chairman has indulged me. But I just will say it concerns me that people are not being informed what our culture and our laws are who are coming here from other countries who think it is perfectly okay to have sex with a 13- year-old if that is the culture they are coming out of. But thank you. Mr. DeSantis. The gentleman's time is expired. I will recognize myself for five minutes. Mr. Judd, it has been reported there has been a dramatic drop in illegal crossings over the past several months. Do you attribute that to the new posture being utilized by the Trump administration and Secretary Kelly? Mr. Judd. I know it is. And in fact when we interview these individuals that are currently crossing the border it's--is they know that the laws are going to be enforced. The simple promise that the laws are going to be enforced have driven down--but I must warn you, we're in a honeymoon period. We have to continue to enforce laws because if we don't, illegal immigration is going to go back up. Mr. Camarota. Can I say one quick thing about that? Mr. DeSantis. Sure. Mr. Camarota. What's interesting about this drop is, look, conditions haven't changed in Central America, just a lot more--fewer people have come. What that reminds us is migration is a choice. People's lives might be difficult but the fact is they make a choice to come. Things haven't changed. A lot of people say, look, people are compelled to come, they have no other option, but just the President's rhetoric mostly has affected people's behavior. Imagine if we follow it up with actual policy. Mr. Stodder. I think it's too soon to make a judgment on that because I think the other way of looking at it could ---- Mr. DeSantis. Let me just ---- Mr. Stodder. Yes. Mr. DeSantis. I just have a couple of things I have got to get to. I appreciate it. Mr. Judd, crime on the border, a real problem? Mr. Judd. It's a huge problem. In fact, if you look at Border Patrol agents, we are assaulted at a rate higher than any other law enforcement agency in the entire United States. And so, yes, border crime is a huge issue. Mr. DeSantis. And because I think Mr. Stodder had mentioned the cartel leaders, they are not exactly crossing the border, but does that mean that the cartels aren't a major problem on the border or do you think they are? Mr. Judd. No, I know the--cartels--when I joined the Border Patrol in 1997 almost 20 years ago, we had mom-and-pop smuggling organizations. That does not happen anymore. Every single facet of crime is controlled by very, very dangerous cartels, pathologically dangerous. They have no regard for human life whatsoever, as we currently see in Mexico. And unfortunately, that is starting to spill over into the United States because they operate here in the United States now whereas they didn't do that 20 years ago. Mr. DeSantis. Dr. Camarota, let me ask you this. Do you agree that there are clearly a lot--a number of immigrants--I mean, legal immigrants I think--who have a very positive economic impact on our society? Mr. Camarota. Especially in the fiscal area, the most educated immigrants are definitely of fiscal benefit, paying more in taxes than they use in services, but that does not describe the typical illegal immigrant. Mr. DeSantis. Right, so there's a difference between people who are coming through the legal channels and it may not always be enforced, but our laws that people, when they come here are legally, are not to be a public charge. They have to support themselves, correct? Mr. Camarota. That is what the law--though it's defined in a very narrow way so it's not that meaningful. Mr. DeSantis. So you are talking about people who are going through obviously unauthorized channels, and there is even a difference between the visa overstays versus the border crossers. The border crossers would have even less skills and less education ---- Mr. Camarota. They'd be the least educated, right. Mr. DeSantis. Yes, okay. Ms. Espinoza, you have seen a variety of these issues or these tragedies over many, many years and you have been an activist, so can you just kind of, you know, crystallize for us the importance of this issue and how it affects some of the human lives that you have been able to work with over these many years? Ms. Espinoza. Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you. And what troubles us most is that all of these crimes and killings are preventable. And we only deal with the killings of Americans. However, child molestation and rape is very high as well. You can see stats in North Carolina. And what is also very troubling is the fact that our own victims, American victims, are misguided through the system. And Agnes here was not allowed to give an impact--a victim's impact statement. So securing the border and enforcing laws--and I am for border wall and fencing just like Mr. Judd here. And I want to say also ---- Mr. DeSantis. You agree with us I think most of the witnesses you don't need to do a 2,000-mile one ---- Ms. Espinoza. Correct. Mr. DeSantis.--because there are some areas that--so you just basically do it in areas where it can stop the crossing? Ms. Espinoza. Absolutely. Mr. DeSantis. Yes. Ms. Espinoza. Yes, sir, and that's common sense. And I don't want this issue to be politicized. And I'm a former Democrat. My father was born in Mexico. I've been in the strawberry fields since I was eight years old so this is not a political issue. When we--my husband and I Tim Lyng started this Remembrance Project, we looked at the issue. It was about an officer in Houston, Texas, who was shot by an illegal alien and there was a lawsuit brought against the city by his widow, who was also a police officer, Joslyn Johnson. And that was about sanctuary cities, never heard of it before, we were not political, and here we are. And again, I just stress to you that just let's look at the issue here, not politicize American lives. And we have seen so much. And again, I appreciate your time, but I just can't tell you how much--if you would just please look at the issue and focus on keeping Americans safe. Mr. DeSantis. Thank you. Ms. Espinoza. Thank you. Mr. DeSantis. Thank you. I appreciate that. I am going to recognize my friend from California for five minutes. Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you and everyone who joined the hearing, including all of the witnesses. I more taken by the fact that a lot of what we are dealing with here is symptoms of a larger problem, and that is for this country and particularly for Congress to come up with thoughtful immigration policy and reform. In a global economy where the world has clearly changed, as the chairman said in his introductory comments, things have changed. In this country, immigration and diversity is the basis of our success and our birth, and it's been part of our success ever since and differentiates us from every other country in the world. And having said that, we need to have immigration policy that is right, that protects against the kind of criminality that we have heard about, both personally and statistically today. So I just want to read one quote because Senator Moynihan many years ago in Congress across the other side of the aisle once famously said ``Everybody is allowed their own opinions but not their own facts.'' And for some weird reason we have now entered into a period whether it is alternative facts or not, we fight opinions, period. So that is why maybe this is an opportunity, Mr. Chairman, to do what we have recently been able to do on a bipartisan level when it comes to the adjudication process and criminality is to deal with evidence- based research. And if all of you could help us with that, knowing of your very strong passions and opinions and different perspectives, I think we would get to the point that the chairman started this committee on, is our failure to come up with an immigration policy that is effective, that allows people to come to this country that the Statue of Liberty proudly welcomes that want to come here and have opportunity but under conditions that we set as a nation in terms of policy to both protect the citizens who are here now but enable those incoming immigrants to flourish as the Founders wanted them to do. So I just want to read one quote because we get into these dueling perspectives with cost from a New York Times Magazine article that was actually quoted by the majority staff and basically corroborating Mr. Camarota's comments and research. But it went on to say, and I quote, ``There are many ways to debate immigration, but when it comes to economics, there isn't much of a debate at all. Nearly all economists of all political persuasions agree that immigrants, those here legally or not, benefit the overall economy, and that is not controversial.'' He goes on to quote from Heidi Shierholz from the National Policy Institute that says, quote, ``There is a consensus that, on average, the incomes of families in this country are increased by a small but clearly positive amount because of immigration,'' end quote. So I just end my comments in saying maybe this is an opportunity in this relatively poorly attended hearing that all of us could focus on the real issue, that we recognize that immigration is a great benefit to this country and it is a basis of this country's success. In California there is plenty of research that shows that the reason we are the sixth-largest economy is because we have the most diversity and are the most reflective of the global economy. Having said that, we have to get immigration policy right, so the things that have happened at least statistically are reduced. So with that, Mr. Chairman, I would again thank you and hope that this is an opening of a new chapter in a bipartisan effort to put our efforts to where it is most effective. Mr. DeSantis. I thank the gentleman. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Hice, for five minutes. Mr. Hice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Judd, let me begin with you. How did the construction of the multilayer border fence in San Diego back in '96 impact illegal entry into the area? Mr. Judd. It moved illegal entry over to Tucson, Arizona, and it caused a huge impact. But what I can tell you, Representative Hice, is that everywhere that we have built a fence, we have been effective. We have been effective in controlling where illegal immigration takes place, which then allows me to be more effective in the number of illegal aliens I take into custody. Mr. Hice. Do you have any idea how many apprehensions there have been, the difference from before the wall was built in San Diego as to apprehensions now? Mr. Judd. Yes. Again, the high watermark was the very late '90s, early 2000s, and San Diego was a fairly busy place. After the fences were built, the double-layer fences, the effective barriers were built, illegal immigration dropped to next to nothing in San Diego, and it all moved out to the locations where there weren't physical barriers. Mr. Hice. Yes, let me give you some figures that I found, and you can verify this for me. What we have seen is there were in 1996 but prior to the barrier there were 480,000 apprehensions in 1996. The most recent figure is 2016. There were under 32,000. That is over a 93 percent decrease. Mr. Judd. And that is largely due to the enforcement posture which we took in San Diego. Unfortunately, we didn't take that same enforcement posture in the other sectors such as Tucson, Arizona, and so we drove everything out there. But since we have been taking those same types of postures, we've driven down illegal immigration in Tucson as well. So, yes ---- Mr. Hice. What are some of the other postures? I now realize we can't positively quantify the effectiveness totally with the layered wall that has been built, but there is no doubt the correlation. The numbers have dropped drastically, over 93 percent since it was put in place. But what other measures have been taken in San Diego? Mr. Judd. Well, the most important measures that we took was not only did we build these barriers, but we promised that anybody that would cross in that particular corridor, we were going to detain them, keep them in custody, and we were going to hold them until they had their deportation hearings, whereas in other locations, if we took them into custody and there weren't--there wasn't bed space with ICE, we would then end up just walking them out our door and letting them go and hope that they would show up for their immigration hearing sometime later on a couple years down the road. But in San Diego what we did was we used what was called the consequence delivery system, which then anybody that crossed through that corridor we would hold in custody and we would put them through deportation proceedings. Mr. Hice. Okay. Mr. Camarota, let me ask you. Do you believe that a border wall would help us address the issue of human trafficking? Mr. Camarota. Yes. I would second what Mr. Judd was saying. Fencing barriers, while in key places would--could make a very enormous difference as a force multiplier and would help us interdict trafficking. Mr. Hice. Have these discussions come up in various communities where you have had talks on this issue? Mr. Camarota. I'm not sure I understand. Do you mean do I think that ---- Mr. Hice. Yes, have you brought this up in discussions you have had in the southwest border area specifically with the issue of human trafficking? Mr. Camarota. The agents that I have spoken to when I have traveled down there all, like Mr. Judd, seem to feel strongly about the wall being helpful. Mr. Hice. So it would help obviously in multiple ways, be it just illegal individuals or drug trafficking, gangs, human trafficking? You believe it would be helpful across the board? Mr. Camarota. I think it can be very helpful, sure. Mr. Hice. Okay. Mr. Judd, let me come back to you as far as--because I'm intrigued with what's happened in San Diego and your experiences overall. What other kind of technologies do you think could be implemented in addition to a physical barrier? Mr. Judd. First and foremost--I worked in the busiest sector, which was the Tucson sector. Individually, I ran a team of agents, which was a mobile interdiction team. We were arresting 100 illegal aliens a night. That was a team of five to six individuals, 100 people per night. Those 100 people that we were arresting, 300 people were getting away from us just simply because that's what the number of people that were coming across. When we started deploying the technologies such as drones, such as more sensors, better scope trucks that had radar on them, when we started deploying that and we became more effective, what we did was we shifted the illegal immigration to other places that didn't have that. So what I'm going to tell you is that it has to be comprehensive because we can't just continue to shift the burden to different sectors. Mr. Hice. Sure. Mr. Judd. We have to ---- Mr. Hice. I get that, but you're talking everything from drones to virtual walls to more border agents. Mr. Judd. They all work. Mr. Hice. All of the above are necessary. Mr. Judd. They all work. Mr. Hice. Okay. Thank you very much, and I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman. I yield. Mr. DeSantis. All right. The gentleman yields back. I want to thank the witnesses for your testimony. We very much appreciate it. You know, a couple things I think that we got from the hearing, I mean, we are not talking about a 2,000-mile wall. It is going to be basically finishing the job of the 2006 Secure Fence Act, and those are very important locations that can be a force multiplier. Doing that and reducing the flow can reduce burdens on taxpayers on the backend and can also reduce crime, which is obviously very important. We all saw these crime victims have stories to tell, and these stories need to be told. And the tragedy is that, you know, the Federal Government is partly responsible for these things and that really upsets me. And you have got to do better. This committee is going to monitor the cost of this thing. You know, we don't want to waste money. But I am convinced that this can be done creatively where you are not just appropriating money but actually using some of the money that is seized or some of these other programs that are clearly running amok and diverting money that was probably a better way to do it. And then I think, Mr. Judd, physical security, just one aspect, important aspect but just one. We have got to support the Border Patrol. We have got to have good policies so that people know the law is going to be enforced. And we have got to deal with this issue of people who are convicted criminals here illegally being released back into society rather than sent back. We just cannot allow additional crimes to be committed at that point, and we have seen it time and time again. So I appreciate everybody's time and testimony, and this is going to be an issue that the committee is going to continue to deal with. So thank you. And with that, this hearing stands adjourned.
