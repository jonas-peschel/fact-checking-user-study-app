The Consortium of National Law Universities that organises CLAT has said, “Registration for the examination closed on 10 July 2020. The exam scheduled for 22 August has been postponed until further notice.”
The examination has been postponed at least four times this year . CLAT 2020 was initially slated to be held on 10 May and has been pushed back ever since then due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Last year the examination was held on 26 May and the result was announced in June.
NDTV quoted convenor of CLAT 2020 professor Balraj Chouhan as saying that the new dates of the exam will be announced after consulting ministries.
Chouhan, vice-chancellor of Dharmashastra National Law University (DNLU) in Jabalpur, said students will find it difficult to appear for the exams due to lockdowns and hence they had to postpone the exam.
