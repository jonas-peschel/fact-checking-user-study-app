Immigration
The United States, by far, attracts more international migrants than any other country, making it “the top destination in the world” for people seeking a new life in a new country. It has been a focal point of emigration and immigration—leaving one country (emigration) and migrating to another one (immigration)—since the very founding of the country, when British colonization of the East Coast of North America led to the formation of the 13 colonies. Seeking opportunity and to escape persecution, poverty, and famine, immigrants have come to America wanting freedom, work, and a new life, and their experiences and dreams have formed an integral part of American history and the American character.[87][88]
A Nation of Immigrants
Immigration has played a critical role in American history. As a result, the United States is often called “a nation of immigrants” and “a melting pot,” meaning a blending of many cultures. The Statue of Liberty (“Lady Liberty”) honors this tradition as a beacon of hope for immigrants. It stands on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, and it was often the first thing immigrants saw from their boats as they approached America and disembarked at the immigration station at nearby Ellis Island, where immigrants were inspected and officially processed. The statue’s uplifted torch welcomed untold millions of immigrants, and the words of poet Emma Lazarus inscribed on the base of the Statue of Liberty reinforced the ideal of America as a safe haven for the needy: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”[90][92]
Immigration to America has frequently come in waves. These have included the European (mainly British) colonization of the East Coast in the 17th and 18th centuries; the large influx of immigrants from Northern and Western Europe (heavily from Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom) from the 1820s-80s; the large influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe (many of them Catholic and Jewish immigrants) and China from the 1880s-1924; Jewish and European refugees escaping Nazi Germany, the Holocaust, and the ravages of World War II from the 1920s-50s; Vietnamese refugees after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975; and recent migrants from Mexico and Central and South America (especially during the presidency of Joe Biden, 2021–25).[88][89][94]
Americans’ reactions to the these waves of immigration has impacted the American experience as significantly as the immigrants themselves. Many of the immigrants to the U.S. during the 1880s-1920s came from non-English speaking countries in Southern and Eastern Europe, compared to earlier immigrants from Britain and Northern and Western Europe. They were often seen as alien and “un-American” and faced staunch prejudice and discrimination, which have been characterized as xenophobia (meaning fear and dislike of strangers and foreigners) and nativism (the desire to protect the interests of native-born or established inhabitants against those of immigrants). The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, for example, was the first major federal legislation to explicitly suspend immigration for a specific nationality; it was repealed in 1943, during World War II, when China was an ally of the United States. Recent migrants from Mexico and Central and South America have troubled many U.S. citizens because millions of them entered the country illegally without background checks for possible histories of criminality. [88][91][98]
A major campaign promise of Donald Trump during his run for reelection in the presidential campaign of 2024 was to rid the country of the “worst of the worst illegal alien criminals” who entered the country unchecked during the presidency of his predecessor, Joe Biden, and who were given protection by “sanctuary cities” and their supporters. The deportations of illegals that followed Trump’s successful reelection were widely welcomed by the president’s conservative supporters and widely condemned by his Democratic opponents, who frequently challenged the president’s deportation measures in court.[99]
Dreamers, DACA, and Pathways to Citizenship
Whether the U.S. should offer a path to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants in the country has been a hotly debated issue. “Path to citizenship” is a political phrase used by advocates for a special process by which undocumented immigrants can become U.S. citizens. This process may include special requirements (such as fees, background checks, or additional waiting times) beyond those already in place for the naturalization of documented, legal immigrants. Citizenship means the immigrants could receive government benefits (such as Social Security and voting rights), bring family members into the U.S., and be protected from deportation even after committing a crime.[1]
The term “legalization” refers to a different process. Legalization means undocumented immigrants would be allowed to remain in the country legally but would not be allowed citizenship or receive the same rights as U.S. citizens. With legalization, the immigrants would be authorized to work in the U.S., have the ability to legally travel in and out of the country, and would not be subject to deportation for being in the country (though committing certain crimes could lead to deportation). They would not be eligible to vote or to receive government benefits or to bring family members into the country. An alternative to citizenship and legalization includes the outright deportation of undocumented immigrants.[1][2][3]
A path to citizenship and legalization are sometimes called “amnesty.” Legally, amnesty is “grant[ing] a pardon to those who have committed an offense.” In immigration law, this means “the government forgiving individuals for using forged/false documentation to gain employment in the U.S. and to remain in the country, and would allow illegal immigrants or undocumented immigrant aliens to gain permanent residency in the United States.” Permanent residency could lead to citizenship or another legal status, depending on the immigration action taken by the U.S. federal government. [4]
While a path to citizenship is often considered a liberal policy of the Democratic Party, both Democratic and Republican presidents have promoted, considered, or enacted such policies. In fact, the largest amnesty program in American modern history was signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan in November 1986. Called the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA, also called the Simpson-Mazzoli Act or the Reagan Amnesty), it allowed some undocumented immigrants to apply first for temporary legal status. Once legal status was granted, those immigrants could then apply for lawful permanent residency (a “green card”) and later for citizenship. The law required that the undocumented immigrants had entered the United States prior to January 1, 1982, or be a farm worker with at least 90 days of validated employment in order to embark on the path to citizenship. 3,040,475 undocumented immigrants applied for temporary legal status via the law, according to a 2002 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) study. Of those, 2,688,730 (88 percent) received permanent residency, and 889,033 of them (33 percent) had received citizenship by 2001. [6][7][8][9][10]]
In 1987, following a failed amendment to the IRCA, Reagan’s Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner, Alan C. Nelson, announced the “Family Fairness” policy that protected from deportation the minor children of undocumented parents covered by the IRCA amnesty, as well as some spouses who met “compelling or humanitarian factors.” Republican President George H.W. Bush expanded upon this new policy, protecting from deportation undocumented family members pursuing the legalization process and allowing them to work if they were in the U.S. before the 1986 passage of the IRCA. These provisions were part of the Immigration Act of 1990.[1][12][13][14]
As demonstrated by the Reagan and Bush amnesty policies, of special concern to many members of both parties is the perilous legal status of immigrants who arrived in the United States as children, who were raised and educated here, and who widely consider the United States their home. Because many of them entered the U.S. without proper documentation, or their parents overstayed their legal right to be in the country, their shaky status in the country has caused alarm. The question many asked was whether it was right to deport minors brought to the country illegally (by no fault of their own), who remember no other country than the United States, and who perhaps can not even speak the language of their birth country.
These special immigrants have been dubbed “Dreamers,” a reference to the failed DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) that was first introduced in the U.S. Senate on August 1, 2001, by U.S. senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) during the Republican presidency of George W. Bush. Several versions of the bill have been introduced in Congress since 2001, with bipartisan support, but none has passed both houses.[18][19] [20]
The amnesty debate resurfaced in 2012 with the enactment of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), a program that some compared to Reagan and Bush’s “Family Fairness” policies of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Created by an executive branch memorandum (a kind of executive order) by Democratic President Barack Obama on June 15, 2012, DACA prevented the deportation of some undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children and allowed them to get work permits. The order did not, however, offer legalization or a path to citizenship, whereas the DREAM Act would have. Many supporters of DACA believe the program should be expanded to include such a path to citizenship.[21][22]
In 2017, Republican President Donald Trump announced that his administration would phase out and end the DACA program if Congress did not replace it with a permanent legislative solution. (Executive actions, like the one that created DACA, can be more easily reversed than Congressional legislation.) Opponents, especially Republicans, challenged DACA’s constitutionality by arguing it violates the separation of powers, asserting that only Congress, not the executive branch, has the authority to create immigration law and provide benefits like work authorization. Trump favored a legislative solution that “could include citizenship, along with strong border security and permanent merit-based reforms,” but no amnesty.[29]
Despite Trump’s urging, Congress failed to find a legislative solution for DACA, but the program was saved on June 18, 2020, when the U.S. Supreme Court declared (in Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California) that the Trump administration had failed to provide a “reasoned explanation” for killing it. However, when Democrat President Joe Biden tried to expand DACA by giving Dreamers additional rights in the Build Back Better Act of 2020, his proposal passed the U.S. House in 2021 but died in the U.S. Senate. On January 17, 2025, a federal appeals court then ruled that DACA, created not by the U.S. Congress but by the president through executive action, was unlawful. The judge, however, allowed current DACA recipients to continue renewing their status for residency in the United States, but new DACA applications would not be processed.[79][105][106][107][108][109][110][111]
To qualify for DACA, undocumented immigrants had to meet certain criteria. They must:
- be under 31 years old as of June 15, 2012
- have come to the United States before their 16th birthday
- have lived in the United States continuously from June 15, 2007, to the present
- have been physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of application
- have come to the United States without documents before June 15, 2012, or have had their lawful status expire as of June 15, 2012
- be in school, have graduated from high school or earned a GED, or have been honorably discharged from the Coast Guard or military
- have not been convicted of a felony or “significant misdemeanors” (such as DUI), or three or more misdemeanors of any kind
However, not all Dreamers are DACA recipients, because not all of them meet the above requirements. As of September 30, 2024, there were some 538,000 DACA recipients in the United States. Most are under the age of 36, more than half of them are female; 81 percent of them came from Mexico; and 28 percent of them live in California, 17 percent in Texas. Many immigrants who do not meet the above qualifications for DACA protection are also called Dreamers, because they, too, were brought to the United States as a children though they do not qualify, for one reason or another (often because of specific date requirements), for the DACA program. This is why there are many more Dreamers than DACA recipients. As of June 2025, there was an estimated 3 million Dreamers in the United States. [112][113][114]
A 2023 Data for Progress poll found that 56 percent of American voters opposed ending DACA while 36 percent were in favor of terminating the program. A 2024 National Immigration Forum and Bullfinch Group survey found 68 percent supported bipartisan legislation with a path to citizenship for Dreamers.[115][116]
While DACA and the fate of Dreamers have been front and center in recent years in the debate over pathways to citizenship, such pathways could take a variety of forms, allowing larger, or smaller, groups of undocumented immigrants a chance at citizenship.

Pro Arguments
(Go to Con Arguments)Pro 1: Many undocumented immigrants have lived in the U.S. for years, paying taxes and contributing to the country, and deserve a path to citizenship.
Many immigrants, undocumented or not, often contribute positively to the economy, taxes, workforce, and business growth and innovation, as well as enriching American society. As author Patrick Radden Keefe wrote in 2009, “The country’s growth has been fueled by successive waves of strivers from other shores, who helped animate the westward push across the continent, fuel the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century, and accelerate the high-tech boom of the late twentieth century.”[100][104]
Adds Laura Collins, director of the Bush Institute–SMU Economic Growth Initiative at the George W. Bush Institute, undocumented immigrants “are our friends, neighbors, relatives, and colleagues — it is in America’s interest to find a reasonable solution for this population. An earned pathway to citizenship, with restitution, allows them to fully assimilate and integrate into the United States without being unfair.”[35]
These undocumented immigrants and their families are already engrained in our country. According to a 2021 George W. Bush Presidential Center white paper (the most recent data of this sort), approximately two-thirds of undocumented immigrants in the country have been in the U.S. for over a decade. 1.6 million were married to U.S. citizens in 2018, and 675,000 were married to lawful permanent residents. 4.4 million American children citizens and another 100,000 lawful permanent resident or non-immigrant children had at least one undocumented parent. [35][36]
According to the most recent data, 95.8 percent of undocumented immigrants were employed in 2018, contributing a total of $20.1 billion in federal income taxes and $11.8 billion in state and local taxes. In doing so, they created a $100 billion surplus in the Social Security program between 2004 and 2014 and a $35.1 billion surplus in the Medicare Trust Fund between 2000 and 2011. In other words, though they created these surpluses for the country through the automatic payroll taxes they pay, they still were denied the benefits that other taxpayers receive. [37]
According to a report from the Center for American Progress in 2021, a five-year path to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants would offer significant results after five years: 32.4 percent ($14,000) increase in annual wages for undocumented workers, 1.1 percent ($700) increase in all other workers’ annual wages, 438,800 new jobs, and a $1.7 trillion increase in the total cumulative GDP (gross domestic product). [38]
As Giovanni Peri and Reem Zaiour argued in the report, “Undocumented immigrants have long been essential to the nation’s economic growth and prosperity. As the country battled the coronavirus pandemic and economic fallout over the past year, the role of undocumented immigrants … [ensured] the well-being and safety of all Americans…. Nearly 3 in 4 undocumented individuals in the workforce—an estimated 5 million—are essential workers. At great risk to themselves and their families, these individuals keep food supply chains running; care for patients in hospitals and support medical systems; maintain the country’s roads and buildings; provide critical care and services for children and the elderly; and educate future generations of Americans. All are critical members of the human infrastructure that powers the nation each day…. [L]egalization and a pathway to citizenship would provide the necessary relief and security for undocumented families and would bring a much-needed boost to the U.S. economy.” [38]
Pro 2: Dreamers deserve a chance at citizenship, because they arrived in the U.S. as children, had no choice in breaking immigration laws, and often know no other country.
“These are young people who study in our schools, they play in our neighborhoods, they’re friends with our kids, they pledge allegiance to our flag. They are Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper. They were brought to this country by their parents — sometimes even as infants — and often have no idea that they’re undocumented until they apply for a job or a driver’s license, or a college scholarship,” explained President Barack Obama.[39]
Called “Dreamers” for the failed DREAM Act legislation, there are between 1,159,000 and 3,600,000 undocumented immigrants in the United States who arrived as minors. 537,730 of those immigrants were registered for DACA as of September 2024. While most Dreamers are from Mexico, they hail from at least 150 countries, including China, Poland, India, and Nigeria. [40][41][42][82]
According to estimates, 76 percent of Dreamers entered the United States in 2011 or earlier, and 71 percent entered the U.S. before they turned 13 years old, with the average Dreamer arriving at age seven. Over 400,000 Dreamers are now a parent to a U.S. citizen child. 50 percent or more Dreamers are essential workers. [41][43][44]
“Over the next 10 years, Dreamers who currently have DACA will contribute an estimated $433.4 billion to the GDP, $60 billion in fiscal impact, and $12.3 billion in taxes to Social Security and Medicare,” estimated Laurence Benenson, Vice President of Policy & Advocacy of the National Immigration Forum. [42]
DACA households paid $6.2 billion in federal and $3.3 billion in state and local taxes annually. They command $25.3 billion in spending power, own 68,000 homes with $760 million in mortgage payments, and pay $2.5 billion in rent yearly. [44]
“Dreamers are showing us every day how committed they are to this country. We need them to help us build a stronger, better future, together. That means creating a path for them to become citizens, as soon as we possibly can,” concludes education journalist Richard Barth.[45]
Pro 3 The U.S. is not just a nation of laws but a nation of immigrants, and its policies should reflect this reality.
“For too many years, the conversation has been predicated on a false dichotomy that says America can either honor its history and traditions as a nation of immigrants or live up to its ideals as a nation of laws by enforcing the current immigration system…. The fundamental problem with this debate is that America is, and has always been, both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws…. Indeed, it is precisely because these two visions of the country are intertwined that America cannot be a nation of laws if those laws are antithetical to its history and ideals as a nation of immigrants,” argues Tom Jawetz, Vice President of Immigration Policy at the Center for American Progress. [46]
As Jawetz concludes, “because the legal immigration system for many years has provided inadequate opportunities for people looking to come to the United States or remain here, an extralegal system has evolved that consists of both unauthorized migration itself and formal and informal policies to not disrupt a generally mutually beneficial arrangement…. [R]estoring the rule of law requires extending a path to citizenship for the broader undocumented population.” [46]
American immigration law has not been updated to deal with the reality of modern illegal immigration. For example, almost half of the undocumented immigrants in the U.S. did not circumvent the Southern border wall; they overstayed their legal visas. [47]
Kalpana Peddibhotla, immigration lawyer, explains, “They entered with a specific purpose and fell out of status for a variety of reasons, only to realize there is no easy mechanism to correct their status violations…. They stay because they built their lives here, bought homes here, had children here.” [47]
The legal immigration system is far too restrictive: it prevents those who want to immigrate legally from doing so because they’d have to “wait in line” for decades; immigrants without higher education are further limited despite their contributions to the U.S. economy; and immigrants need an American sponsor even to apply, among a litany of other defects in the laws. [48]
Current immigration laws are broken and do not reflect American values as a nation of immigrants. The laws have encouraged the arrival or overstay of undocumented immigrants without offering a path to reconcile their status with the law. [48]
