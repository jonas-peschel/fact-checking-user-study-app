Pandemic relief aid continued to inflate the percentage of state government revenue made up of federal dollars in fiscal year 2022. The share decreased by less than a percentage point from the prior year, but at 36.4%, it remained high compared with pre-pandemic levels. Federal funds were the largest revenue source in just 16 states; the majority of states primarily relied on state tax revenue. Tax collections accounted for 48.3% of overall state revenue, up 1.4 percentage points from fiscal 2021 as state tax revenue continued to climb after the pandemic-induced recession.
