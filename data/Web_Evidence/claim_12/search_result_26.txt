Mar 13, 2009 - Responding to an Historic Economic Crisis: The Obama Program
★ Feb 04, 2021 - The Biden stimulus is admirably ambitious. But it brings some big risks, too.
President Biden’s $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief plan, added to the stimulus measure Congress passed in December with the incoming administration’s strong support, would represent the boldest act of macroeconomic stabilization policy in U.S. history. Its ambition, its rejection of austerity orthodoxy and its commitment to reducing economic inequalit... Read More
Nov 15, 2023 - The cancer of antisemitism is spreading. Colleges must take the right stand.
Lawrence H. Summers, a Post contributing columnist, is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. This column is adapted from remarks delivered at the Harvard Medical and Dental School Shabbat Observance on Nov. 10.
We are, I am convinced, at a moment of moral and mortal peril in the world and in university communities like my own.... Read More

Aug 24, 2023 - What Jerome Powell should say on inflation
On Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell will give his third Jackson Hole address since inflation emerged as a major macroeconomic issue. These addresses are significant because they frame the monetary policy debate for the coming year. In his 2021 keynote, Powell supported markets by emphasizing why he thought inflation was transitory and... Read More
Aug 18, 2023 - China’s economy is finally hitting a wall
There can now be little doubt that just as the conventional wisdom way overstated the economic prospects of Russia in 1960 and Japan in 1990, so have China’s prospects been greatly exaggerated in this decade. Indeed, I think there is a good chance that, measured at market exchange rates, U.S. gross domestic product will exceed China’s for another g... Read More
Jul 07, 2023 - The affirmative action ruling is big. Now elite colleges need to think bigger.
I was sorry but not surprised to see Thursday’s Supreme Court decision disallowing affirmative action in college admissions. It is ironic that a court that regards itself as conservative has taken an action so radical in terms of upsetting long-standing practices and expanding federal power over private institutions. Unless universities now respond... Read More
Jul 05, 2023 - The moral and legal case for sending Russia’s frozen $300 billion to Ukraine
Russia’s assault on Ukraine has become a brutal war of attrition — militarily but also economically and socially. Russian President Vladimir Putin recognizes the nature of this struggle. Ukraine, having lost one-third of its GDP, with one-third of its population already displaced and the lights flickering on and off, could win battles and still los... Read More
Jan 16, 2023 - The Republicans don’t want to fix the IRS. Here’s how to do it anyway.
with Natasha Sarin
The current moment is perhaps the most important for U.S. tax administration since the income tax was put in place more than a century ago.
Consider just the past six months: Congress has passed the largest-ever increase in IRS funding; repeal of that funding has become the first legislative priority of the new Republican... Read More
Dec 21, 2022 - What the Fed should do next on inflation
The debate over U.S. monetary policy is in a new phase. There is no longer any question that the Fed allowed itself to fall way behind the curve in the second half of 2021 and early 2022, calling its credibility into question. It is equally clear that, as its critics urged, the Fed has since moved aggressively to contain inflation by raising rates ... Read More
Oct 31, 2022 - Curbing inflation comes first, but we can’t stop there
The United States right now faces as complex a set of macroeconomic challenges as at any time in 75 years.
That is not the same as saying it faces its darkest economic moment. Our current situation includes strengths such as low unemployment and is by no measure as grave as the 2009 financial crisis or 1970s inflation. What stands out, however, ... Read More
Jun 05, 2022 - My inflation warnings have spurred questions. Here are my answers.
I have argued repeatedly that Federal Reserve policy remains dangerously behind the curve in ways that will lead to poor economic performance in the years ahead, and that a rapid change in direction is needed. This view has been challenged from both outside the Fed and within it, including in Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell’s most recent speech. Here, l... Read More
Mar 20, 2022 - The Fed is charting a course to stagflation and recession
When the long-awaited process of raising interest rates begins Wednesday, market observers will fixate on the precise words used in the Fed statement and during Chair Jerome H. Powell’s news conference. The focus will be on what they signal about the number of rate increases coming this year and next, as well as the schedule for selling down the bo... Read More
Feb 07, 2022 - On inflation, we can learn from the mistakes of the past — or repeat them
A year ago I warned that “there is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflation pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation.”
At the time, the much-greater optimism of the Biden administration and Federal Reserve were in line with the consensus view... Read More
Nov 16, 2021 - On inflation, it’s past time for team ‘transitory’ to stand down
There is a wise apocryphal saying often attributed to John Maynard Keynes: “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?” After years of advocating more expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, I altered my view this past winter, and I believe the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve need to further adjust their thinking on infl...

Sep 22, 2021 - We don’t have to fly blind into the next pandemic
—by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Lawrence H. Summers
We are nowhere near the end of the pandemic. Yet covid-19 is a prelude to more and possibly worse pandemics to come.
Scientists have repeatedly warned that in the years to come outbreaks will be more frequent, spread more quickly and take more lives. Together with the wor... Read More
May 24, 2021 - The inflation risk is real
The covid-19 chapter in U.S. economic history is coming to a close more rapidly than almost anyone expected, including me. Within weeks, gross domestic product will reach a new peak, and it is likely to exceed its pre-covid trend line before year’s end, as the economy enjoys its fastest year of growth in decades. Job openings are at record levels, ... Read More

Jun 29, 2020 - U.S. workers need more power
By Lawrence H. Summers and Anna Stansbury
Covid-19 has brought into sharp relief the contrast between the experiences of the higher-income Americans who receive deliveries and the lower-income Americans who fulfill them, between those who can work safely from home and those who must expose themselves to risk, often with inadequate protection, b...

May 14, 2020 - Covid-19 looks like a hinge in history
The Covid-19 crisis is the third major shock to the global system in the 21st century, following the 2001 terror attacks and the 2008 financial crisis. I suspect it is by far the most significant.
Although the earlier events will figure in history textbooks, both 9/11 and the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy will fade over time from popular memory.

May 05, 2020 - Given what we’re losing in GDP, we should be spending far more to develop tests
When it comes to crafting foreign policy, designing anti-poverty programs or implementing measures to combat climate change, economists have an understandable tendency to feel as though the economic aspects of the debate receive short shrift. The opposite is true when it comes to the pandemic. If anything, the United States is in danger of overemph... Read More
Apr 15, 2020 - National governments have gone big. The IMF and World Bank need to do the same.
By Gordon Brown and Lawrence H. Summers
The nations of the developed world have responded to the covid-19 crisis by supporting their domestic economies and financial systems in bold and unprecedented ways, and at a scale that would have been unimaginable three months ago.
In contrast, when the world’s finance and central bank governors conven... Read More
Mar 25, 2020 - Trump is missing the big picture on the economy
As an economist, I am normally enthusiastic when presidents or other political leaders emphasize the economic aspect of public policy issues. I am all for economic growth, cost benefit analyses, trade agreements, more flexible markets and prudent deregulation. Yet I am appalled by President Trump’s invocation of economic arguments as a basis for ov... Read More
Mar 04, 2020 - What the Fed can do to help with with coronavirus’s economic aftershock
While the Fed acted preemptively Tuesday, it is still too early to say much that is definitive about the economic threat from coronavirus. We do know, however, that this is one of the most dangerous and disruptive disease outbreaks since World War I.
Science and medicine have of course progressed massively since the 1918 Spanish flu. On the othe... Read More
Jan 30, 2020 - If business leaders are serious about doing good, they can start by paying their taxes
By Natasha Sarin and Lawrence H. Summers
Over the past year, the concept that corporations owe a responsibility to the broader society beyond their responsibility to their shareholders has flourished. The Business Roundtable renounced its earlier view that companies exist to serve stockholders and endorsed stakeholder capitalism last summer. Bla... Read More
Jan 07, 2020 - Do Americans really need to be more thrifty?
January 7, 2020
Few economic virtues are more universally applauded than thrift.
Going back at least to Ben Franklin, Americans have equated greater thriftiness with greater worthiness. Progressives decry the limited saving and wealth accumulation of middle-income families and express alarm over the widely reported “fact” that 40 percent of A... Read More
Nov 17, 2019 - Yes, our tax system needs reform. Let’s start with this first step.
By Natasha Sarin and Lawrence H. Summers
November 17, 2019
While there’s plenty of disagreement about how the money should be used, almost everyone involved in public-policy debates agrees that it would be good if the federal government could collect more revenue without raising tax rates or reducing tax deductions or credits.
It should be... Read More
Nov 07, 2019 - Warren’s plan to finance Medicare-for-all pushes into dangerous and uncharted territory
November 5, 2019
Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren last week mounted a passionate defense of universal government-provided health care and made a detailed case that it can be paid for without burdening the middle class. The vision of Medicare-for-all is immensely attractive and evokes health systems in other countries that perfo... Read More
Oct 11, 2019 - Global economy is at risk from a monetary policy black hole
Governments should borrow more to stave off secular stagnation
October 11, 2019
New IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva’s first speech makes bracing reading for the global financial community as it gathers this coming week in Washington for the annual IMF and World Bank meetings. Ms Georgieva noted that while two years ago growth was ... Read More
Oct 10, 2019 - We no longer share a common lived experience
October 9, 2019
The economic geography of the United States is central to our most serious economic social and political problems. And yet it is a subject that receives only the episodic attention of federal policymakers and initiatives that are far too small to have a meaningful chance of success.
By almost any measure, U.S. citizens no long... Read More
Sep 03, 2019 - If Business Roundtable CEOs are serious about reform, here’s what they should do
The Business Roundtable recently announced a major policy change declaring that the purpose of a corporation is not just to serve shareholders (its official position since 1997) but “to create value for all our stakeholders.” At a time of considerable disillusionment with U.S. capitalism, this is a significant statement that could signal meaningful...

Jul 09, 2019 - Christine Lagarde enters the European Central Bank at a perilous moment
The announcement last week that Christine Lagarde would be leaving her post as managing director of the International Monetary Fund to become president of the European Central Bank marks what may be the most important change in the leadership of the international financial system in decades. At a time when the United States is abdicating its system... Read More
Jun 05, 2019 - It’s tempting for the Fed to move slowly. That would be a grave error.
The Federal Reserve will over the next several months make monetary policy decisions that are as consequential as any it has made since the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2007-2008. The temptation in a highly uncertain and politicized environment will be to move cautiously. Yet this would be a grave error in the current context, where a re... Read More
May 15, 2019 - There’s a revealing puzzle in the China tariffs
On Monday, China announced new tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. exports, and the United States threatened new tariffs on up to $300 billion of Chinese goods. These actions were cited as the principle reason for a decline of more than 600 points in the Dow Jones industrial average, or about 2.4 percent in broader measures of the stock market. With the...

Apr 01, 2019 - Fair, comprehensive tax reform is the right path forward
By Natasha Sarin and Lawrence H. Summers
March 29, 2019

Over the last several weeks, we have paid careful attention to tax proposals by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on top earners, and by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, for a wealth tax on those worth more than... Read More
Feb 05, 2019 - No trade deal can dictate our relationship with China
As the United States and China continue to joust over trade and technology, the U.S. policy debate contrasts two views of the primary problem.
A first view expressed often in President Trump’s tweets locates the key issue in the bilateral trade deficit that the United States chronically runs with China. On this theory of the problem, a solution ... Read More
Jan 09, 2019 - We must prepare now for the likelihood of a recession
Excess austerity is a bigger risk than fiscal profligacy
When people are fundamentally healthy, they do not yet know what will cause their death. An economic recovery is healthy if it is not clear what will cause the next recession. By this standard, the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, although disappointingly slow, has been healthy for... Read More
Dec 05, 2018 - Can anything hold back China’s economy?
Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping reached an agreement over the weekend at the Group of 20 meeting in Argentina on a framework for trade dialogue that will delay the imposition of new American tariffs. While surely better than the alternative, this step does not address any of the fundamental tensions in the economic relationship between the United S... Read More
Nov 06, 2018 - Fed bashing is a fool’s game
President Trump has publicly and harshly rebuked Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome H. Powell for what the president regards as misguided interest-rate increases that threaten continued economic expansion. As with much of what Trump says and does, this way of doing business is counterproductive — irrespective of whatever merit his underlying pos... Read More
Oct 09, 2018 - Driving across the US gave me a different perspective on the American economy
Economists like me see the world through the prism of models, fit to statistical data and tested against market realities. Economic models provide powerful perspective: I have used them to argue that, had the economy been left to itself and policymakers not heeded the lessons of history and theory, the 2008 financial crisis might have led to anothe...

Sep 04, 2018 - Ending quarterly reports will not stop corporate short-termism
Requiring less information would favour better-connected professional investors
President Donald Trump has asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate moving public companies to a six-month rather than three-month reporting cycle to combat an excessive corporate focus on the short term.
Progressive critics a... Read More
Aug 06, 2018 - Trump claims credit he is not due on the economy
President Donald Trump regularly and proudly takes credit for the US economy’s strong performance.
With rapid growth in the second quarter, the stock market strong, the unemployment rate back below 4 per cent and the midterm elections looming, his rhetoric and that of his supporters will probably escalate in the coming months.
In fact the a... Read More
Jul 03, 2018 - A jobs guarantee — progressives’ latest big idea
The impulse behind the latest “big” progressive idea of creating a federal job guarantee is entirely valid. Studies show that those without jobs are much more likely to be dissatisfied with their lives, to become addicted to alcohol or drugs and to be abusive within their families than even those working at low wages they find inadequate.
On thi... Read More
Jun 05, 2018 - Donald Trump’s trade policy violates every rule of strategy
Donald Trump has put aggressive trade policy at the centre of his approach to the economy. No other economic subject has received such sustained presidential attention or generated so much controversy.
This is problematic as most economists agree that changes in trade policy are unlikely to have a big effect on growth in employment or over gross d... Read More
May 06, 2018 - The threat of secular stagnation has not gone away
The economy is prone to sluggish growth — if the past few years are anything to go by
May 6, 2018
Unemployment in the US is below 4 per cent and growth in the economy is accelerating. By recent standards growth in Europe and Japan is also strong. In these circumstances many believe the idea of secular stagnation can be written off.

Apr 09, 2018 - Donald Trump trade threats lack credibility
April 8, 2018
US bluster has caused most of the world to rally to China’s side
As the possibility of a trade war between the US and China looms, threats and counter-threats are hurled back and forth and markets gyrate, economic logic and truth appear to be an early casualty. There are certain points of fact on which there should be no disagre... Read More
Mar 05, 2018 - Currency markets send a warning on the US economy
One of the many surprising aspects of financial market performance over the past year has been the weak performance of the US dollar, which has fallen by close to 10 per cent on a trade weighted basis and by more than 10 per cent against the euro.
This has occurred despite a variety of factors that might have been expected to push the dollar up.... Read More
Feb 05, 2018 - Jerome Powell’s challenge at the Fed
Janet L. Yellen has completed her term with unemployment much lower than it was when she began, with inflation low and closer to target, and with the financial system better capitalized and more liquid. What more can anyone ask from a Fed chair?
Yellen’s success is a tribute to her judgment and thoughtfulness. Importantly, though, like Alan Gree... Read More
Jan 21, 2018 - Trump’s big choice at Davos
Will he reassure his audience that the US believes in strong global institutions?
Donald Trump will be attending this year’s World Economic Forum. Inevitably, attention will focus on whether the US president projects a commitment to internationalist values or reiterates his commitment to truculent nationalism in the name of making America “great... Read More
Dec 10, 2017 - Sugar high is right diagnosis, tax cuts are the wrong prescription
The approaching end of President Trump's first year in office, another strong employment report and a still-strong stock market make it appropriate to revisit my year-old judgment that the economy is enjoying a "sugar high." Unfortunately, the best available evidence suggests that signs of current market and economic strength are largely unrelated ... Read More
Nov 06, 2017 - Three (almost) inexplicable parts of the Republican tax plan
With the release of the Republican tax proposal, the most important tax debate in a generation is in full swing. Most reasonable experts agree that tax reform has the potential to spur investment and raise wages while also simplifying the system and increasing its fairness and legitimacy. The right question for debate is not the desirability of tax... Read More
Oct 08, 2017 - America’s tax plan is not worth its name
The international community should give officials a very uncomfortable week
October 8, 2018
The US administration’s tax plan is not a plan. It is a mélange of ideas put forth without precision or arithmetic. It is not clear enough to permit the kind of careful quantitative analysis of budget costs, economic impacts and distributional implicat... Read More
Sep 03, 2017 - America needs its unions more than ever
September 4, 2017

With the term of Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair ending next February, the president will have to nominate and the Senate will have to confirm a new head of the central bank in coming months. There is much discussion of the merits and implications of possible candidates for the job. For Donald Trump and the Senate it will be important to begi... Read More
Jul 12, 2017 - Trump’s behavior is the biggest threat to U.S. national security
Confusing civility with comity is a grave mistake in human or international relations. Yes, the Group of 20 summit issued a common communique after the leaders’ meeting. Some see this as an indication that some normality is being restored in international relations between the United States and other countries. The truth is that at no previous G-20... Read More
Jun 05, 2017 - Business needs to show there is more to the US than Donald Trump
June 4, 2017
In economics as in life things often take longer to happen than you think they will and then happen faster than you thought they could. So it may turn out with the catastrophic international economic policies of President Donald Trump. It is possible that the past week will be remembered as a hinge in history - a moment when the US ... Read More
May 07, 2017 - Less is more when it comes to Federal Reserve policy
May 7, 2017
Friday’s US employment report was generally strong, with job growth of 211,000, declining unemployment and a drop in the number of workers involuntarily confined to part-time work.
The data, along with indications that growth in the second quarter is likely to come in above 3 per cent, suggest the economy is reasonably robust. But... Read More
Apr 10, 2017 - The US must work on its economic relationship with China
April 9, 2017
Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have now completed their first summit. Observers on both sides seem to be relieved. If no diplomatic breakthroughs on major issues were achieved, it is also the case that there were no outward displays of truculence from either side. Neither high hopes nor great fears have been realised... Read More
Mar 07, 2017 - Robots are wealth creators and taxing them is illogical
March 5, 2017
Governments can offset lost jobs by investing in education and retraining
I usually agree with Bill Gates on matters of public policy and admire his emphasis on the combined power of markets and technology. But I think he went seriously astray in a recent interview when he proposed, without apparent irony, a tax on robots to cus... Read More
Feb 06, 2017 - Revoking trade deals will not help American middle classes
February 6, 2017
The advent of global supply chains has changed production patterns in the US
Trade agreements have been central to American politics for some years. The idea that renegotiating trade agreements will "make America great again" by substantially increasing job creation and economic growth swept Donald Trump into office.

Jan 17, 2017 - Economy under Trump: Plan for the worst
An ironic contradiction is likely to define the global economic community’s convocation in Davos this week as it awaits Donald Trump’s inauguration. There has not been so much anxiety about U.S. global leadership or about the sustainability of market-oriented democracy at any time in the past half-century. Yet with markets not only failing to swoon... Read More
Jan 08, 2017 - US tax reform is vital but Trump’s plan is flawed
Corporate tax reform has rightly been identified by both the President-elect and Congress as an immediate priority. There is no doubt that the status quo — where America has the highest statutory rate among major countries and companies hoard cash overseas — can be improved on. Unfortunately, the reforms identified by Paul Ryan, speaker of the Hous... Read More
Dec 05, 2016 - Trump’s tax plans favour the rich and will hamper economic growth
Just as Ronald Reagan's landmark 1986 bipartisan tax reform increased simplicity, fairness and economic efficiency by broadening the tax base and reducing rates, today reform of the system has the potential to help American families and the economy.
Properly designed, revenue-neutral reforms could help to offset the dramatic increases in inequal... Read More
Nov 14, 2016 - A badly designed US stimulus will only hurt the working class
Not even US presidents with political mandates can repeal the laws of economics
November 13, 2016
Following a brief market plunge, the President-elect’s speech on Tuesday night was more conciliatory than many expected and emphasised his commitment to infrastructure investment. Investors have, on balance, concluded that the combination of a sh... Read More
Oct 09, 2016 - Voters sour on traditional economic policy
It is hard to escape the conclusion that the world is seeing a renaissance of populist authoritarianism
October 9, 2016
As the world’s finance ministers and central bank governors came together in Washington last week for their annual global financial convocation, the mood was sombre. The spectre of secular stagnation and inadequate economic grow... Read More
Sep 12, 2016 - Building the case for greater infrastructure investment
September 12, 2016
The issue now is not whether the US should invest more but what the policy framework should be
There is a consensus that the US should substantially raise its level of infrastructure investment. Economists and politicians of all persuasions recognise that this can create quality jobs and provide economic stimulus without po... Read More
Aug 08, 2016 - The progressive case for championing pro-growth policies
August 8, 2016
Issues of inequality, fairness, middle-class living standards and job creation have been central to the US presidential campaign.
Rightly so. For many years, the incomes of all groups tended to move together. Indeed, as a graduate student in the late 1970s, I was taught that it was a "stylised fact" that the shares of US total in... Read More
Jul 10, 2016 - Voters deserve responsible nationalism not reflex globalism
July 10, 2016
It is clear after the Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s victory in the Republican presidential primaries that voters are revolting against the relatively open economic policies that have been the norm in the US and Britain since the second world war.
Populist opposition to international integration is on the rise in much of contine... Read More
Jun 06, 2016 - The economic consequences of a Trump win would be severe
On June 23, the UK will vote on whether to remain in the EU. On November 8, the US will vote on whether to elect Donald Trump as president. These elections have much in common. Both could lead to outcomes that would have seemed inconceivable not long ago. Both pit angry populists against the political establishment. And in both cases, polling sugge... Read More
May 08, 2016 - Europe is right to kill off the criminal’s favourite banknote
So-called Bin Ladens have an important role facilitating illicit activity
Most of the time I use this column to recommend policy changes that I believe would make the world a better place. This time I am saluting a policy change I believe will have significant benefits - one that carries with it important lessons.
The decision of the E... Read More
Apr 11, 2016 - Global trade should be remade from the bottom up
Since the end of the second world war, a broad consensus in support of global economic integration as a force for peace and prosperity has been a pillar of the international order. From global trade agreements to the EU project; from the Bretton Woods institutions to the removal of pervasive capital controls; from expanded foreign direct investmen... Read More
Mar 07, 2016 - A world stumped by stubbornly low inflation
Here is a thought experiment that illuminates the challenges currently facing macroeconomic policymakers in the US and the rest of the industrial world.
Imagine that in a brief period inflation expectations around the industrial world, as inferred from both the markets for indexed bonds or inflation swaps, rose by nearly 50 basis points to a lev... Read More
Feb 08, 2016 - No free lunches but plenty of cheap ones
February 7, 2016
Trade-offs have long been at the center of economics. The aphorism “there is no such thing as a free lunch” captures a central economic idea: You cannot get something for nothing. Among the many trade-offs emphasized in economics courses are guns vs. butter, public vs. private, efficiency vs. equity, environmental protection vs.... Read More
Jan 11, 2016 - Heed the fears of the financial markets
Often markets are volatile at the end of the year - as many traders go on holiday and those with losses unload them - and then settle down as a new year begins. Not this year. U.S. and European markets closed significantly lower on Friday after a very rough week despite a very strong U.S. jobs report. The week's economic news was dominated by drama... Read More
Dec 06, 2015 - Central bankers do not have as many tools as they think
December 6, 2015
The unresolved question is how policy can delay and ultimately contain the next recession
While debate about the relevance of the secular stagnation idea to current economic conditions continues to rage, there is now almost universal acceptance of a crucial part of the argument. It is agreed that the "neutral" interest rate... Read More
Nov 09, 2015 - Grasp the reality of China’s rise
November 8, 2015
For the first time in centuries, China affects the global economy as much as it is affected by the global economy. In the years ahead, China is likely to account for between one-third and one-half of growth in global incomes, trade and commodity demand, and its significance will only increase as its share of the world economy ri...

Oct 07, 2015 - The case for expansion
Policymakers must abandon structural reform rhetoric and embrace fiscal stimulus

As the world's financial policymakers convene for their annual meeting on Friday in Peru, the dangers facing the global economy are more severe than at any time since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
The problem of secular stagnation ... Read More
Aug 23, 2015 - The Fed looks set to make a dangerous mistake
August 23, 2015
Raising rates this year will threaten all of the central bank's major objectives
Will the Federal Reserve’s September meeting see US interest rates go up for the first time since 2006? Officials have held out the prospect that it might, and have suggested that — barring major unforeseen developments — rates will probably be in... Read More

The real need is for a cadre of trusted, tough-minded investors that will support strong management teams

There are not many wholly new areas to open up in economic policy. But in recent months there has been a wave of innovative proposals directed at improving economic performance in general, and middle-class incomes in partic... Read More
Jul 12, 2015 - Complacency and incrementalism are traps to avoid
July 12, 2015
Clear-eyed, bold action is what the world requires if the financial drama is to subside.
Against a backdrop of slow and diminishing growth forecasts, recent months and especially recent weeks have seen an extraordinary level of financial drama. While not rising to the level of the systemic global crisis of 2008, or the period of... Read More
Jun 21, 2015 - Greece is Europe’s failed state in waiting
June 20, 2015
When, as now appears likely, Greece financially separates from Europe it will at one level be no one’s fault.
The Greek leaders will rightly explain that having imposed more austerity on themselves than any industrialised country has suffered since the Depression, they could not have done more without light at the end of tunnel ... Read More
Jun 17, 2015 - Rescuing the free-trade deals
June 14, 2015
The Senate’s rejection of President Woodrow Wilson’s commitment of the United States to the League of Nations was the greatest setback to U.S. global leadership of the last century. While not remotely as consequential, the votes in the House last week that, unless revisited, would doom the Trans-Pacific Partnership send the same kind... Read More
May 18, 2015 - Reform-minded Ukraine merits debt reduction
May 17, 2015
Ukraine, the international community and its creditors will soon have to reach a conclusion about how to handle the country’s debt. The case for debt reduction is as strong as any that I have encountered over the past quarter century. How the issue is resolved will say much about the extent of international commitment to Ukraine a... Read More
Apr 05, 2015 - Time US leadership woke up to new economic era
April 5, 2015
This past month may be remembered as the moment the United States lost its role as the underwriter of the global economic system. True, there have been any number of periods of frustration for the US before, and times when American behaviour was hardly multilateralist, such as the 1971 Nixon shock, ending the convertibility of the ...

Mar 09, 2015 - A deal worth getting right
March 8, 2015
Over the next few months, the question of U.S. participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal is likely to be resolved one way or the other. It is, to put it mildly, a highly controversial issue. Proponents believe a deal is essential to both our economic and geopolitical interests; opponents fear that it will primarily ... Read More
Feb 09, 2015 - Only raise US rates when whites of inflation’s eyes are visible
February 8, 2015
Aborting recovery and risking a further slowing of price rises is potentially catastrophic
I cannot recall a moment when the gap between what markets expect the US Federal Reserve to do and what the Fed itself has forecast it will do has been as large. Markets predict that the Fed will raise rates only to 1.6 per cent by the ... Read More
Jan 20, 2015 - FT Video: Make the middle class a priority
Summers talked with FT editor, Lionel Barber, on January 19, 2015 about the Inclusive Prosperity report, why economic growth has been hampered and whether ECB action can lift middle-class incomes. Read More
Jan 18, 2015 - Focus on growth for the middle class
January 18, 2015
The most challenging economic issue ahead of us involves a group that will barely be represented at this week’s annual Davos summit: the middle classes of the world’s industrial countries. As the Center for American Progress’s Inclusive Prosperity Commission, which I co-chaired with Ed Balls, the top economic official in Britain... Read More
Jan 05, 2015 - Let this be the year when we put a proper price on carbon
January 4, 2015
The fall in oil prices and declines in other energy prices make the case for a tax overwhelming
The case for carbon taxes has long been compelling. With the recent steep fall in oil prices and associated declines in other energy prices it is overwhelming. There is room for debate about the size of the tax and about how the pro... Read More

The only answer is prompt and aggressive responses to failure

Nov 10, 2014 - We play with fire if we skimp on public health
November 10, 2014
Epidemics and pandemics are like earthquakes. Tragic, inevitable and unpredictable. It starts as a random event. A virus jumps species from a bird, bat, or other animal to "Patient Zero" - who passes it on to other human beings. More likely than not, over the course of this century we will face an influenza pandemic similar to ... Read More
Oct 07, 2014 - Why public investment really is a free lunch
The IMF finds that a dollar of spending increases output by nearly $3
October 7, 2014
It has been joked that the letters IMF stand for "it's mostly fiscal." The International Monetary Fund has long been a stalwart advocate of austerity as the route out of financial crisis, and every year it chastises dozens of countries for their fiscal indis... Read More

There may be supply-side barriers that hold the economy back before constraints on demand bind

Aug 10, 2014 - Ending presidents’ second-term curse
August 10, 2014
Disillusionment with Washington has rarely run higher. Congress is unable to act even in areas where there is widespread agreement that measures are necessary, such as immigration, infrastructure spending and business tax reform. The Obama administration, rightly or wrongly, is increasingly condemned as ineffectual. What was on... Read More

New York is more dependent on financial services yet its GDP is above its previous peak
May 4, 2014

Inequality will have to be addressed, with free markets playing a pivotal role
Inequality has emerged as a major issue in the US and beyond. A generation ago it could reasonably have been asserted that the overall growth rate of the economy was the main influence on the growth in middle-class incomes and progress in reducing... Read More
Jan 05, 2014 - Washington must not settle for secular stagnation
January 5, 2014
By Lawrence Summers
We may, as I argued last month in the Financial Times, be in a period of “secular stagnation” in which sluggish growth and output, and employment levels well below potential, might coincide for some time to come with problematically low real interest rates.
Since the start of this century, annual US gros... Read More
Dec 15, 2013 - Why stagnation might prove to be the new normal
December 15, 2013
In the past decade, before the crisis, bubbles and loose credit were only sufficient to drive moderate growth
Is it possible that the US and other major global economies might not return to full employment and strong growth without the help of unconventional policy support? I raised that notion – the old idea of “secular sta... Read More
Nov 11, 2013 - Give the Obamacare bug the correct treatment
There is still time to follow the basic rules of project management
November 11, 2013
As the president has recognized, the failure on the part of his administration to deliver a functioning website that Americans can use to enroll in “Obamacare”, the Affordable Care Act, represents an inexcusable error. Having succeeded after more than a cent... Read More
Oct 13, 2013 - The battle over the US budget is the wrong fight
A small rise in economic growth would entirely eliminate the projected long-term budget gap
October 13, 2013
This month Washington is consumed by the impasse over reopening the government and raising the debt limit. It seems likely that this episode, like the 1995-96 government shutdowns and the 2011 debt limit scare, will be remembered mainl... Read More
Jul 07, 2013 - Tax reform can aid multinationals, cut deficit
July 7, 2013
Imagine a library where many books have been borrowed and are long overdue. There is a case for an amnesty to get the books back and move on. There is a case for saying that rules are rules and fines must be paid. But the worst strategy is to keep indicating that an amnesty may come soon without ever introducing it. And this is roug...

Jun 03, 2013 - It is no time for faster cuts to the US budget deficit
June 3, 2013
Things are looking up. Led by rising house prices, the US recovery is likely to accelerate this year. Budget deficit projections have declined, too. And although the European economy is stagnant, there is some evidence that stimulative policies are gaining traction in Japan. So this is an opportune moment to reconsider the principle... Read More
May 06, 2013 - The buck does not stop with Reinhart and Rogoff
May 6, 2013
The economics commentariat – and no small part of the political debate – has been consumed in the past few weeks with controversy surrounding a piece of research by my Harvard colleagues (and friends) Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. The article, published in 2010, had been widely interpreted as showing that economic growth is lik... Read More
Apr 15, 2013 - Is America’s democracy broken?
April 15, 2013
With the release of the president’s budget, Washington has once again descended into partisan squabbling. There is in America today pervasive concern about the basic functioning of our democracy. Congress is viewed less favorably than ever before in the history of public opinion polling. Revulsion at political figures unable to re... Read More

March 17, 2013
In economic policy what is good for one is not good for all
Europe’s economic situation is viewed with far less concern than was the case six, 12 or 18 months ago. Policy makers in Europe far prefer engaging the US on a possible trade and investment agreement to more discussion on financial stability and growth. However, mispla... Read More

America must not lose sight of infrastructure, jobs and growth

Too many provisions favour a very small minority of fortunate taxpayers

Sooner or later the American tax code will be reformed. Probably sooner. Raising revenue will be the main motivation, but at a time of sharply increasing economic polarisation issues of fairness will be prominent too. There are also legitimate concerns a... Read More
Oct 28, 2012 - Building blocks for America’s recovery
October 28, 2012
The final full week of the US presidential campaign will see both candidates intensely debate the future of economic policy. But despite the rhetoric about its means, most experts agree on its ends. First, re-establishing economic growth at a rate that makes real reductions in unemployment possible; second, placing the nation’s ... Read More
Oct 14, 2012 - The world is stuck in a vicious cycle
October 14, 2012
If the global economy was in trouble before the annual World Bank and IMF meetings in Tokyo last week, it is hard to believe that it is now smooth sailing. Indeed, apart from the modest stimulus provided to the Japanese economy by all the official visitors and the wealthy financial sector hangers on, it is difficult to see what ... Read More
Sep 16, 2012 - Britain risks a lost decade unless it changes course
September 16, 2012
It is the mark of science and perhaps rational thought to operate with a falsifiable understanding of how the world works.

Aug 19, 2012 - America’s state will expand whoever wins
August 19, 2012
With the selection of Paul Ryan as the Republican vice-presidential candidate, it is clear both political parties agree that the central issue in the presidential election will be the scale and scope of government involvement in the US economy.

Jul 15, 2012 - Land of Opportunity Can Fight Inequality
July 15, 2012
Even if the process proves protracted, the American economy will eventually recover. Yet even as cyclical issues cease to dominate the economic conversation, it is likely that inequality will move to the forefront.

Jun 18, 2012 - Time to act: Euro collapse would define our era
June 18, 2012
Once again good news has had a half-life in the markets of less than 24 hours. Just as news of Spain’s bank bailout rallied markets and sentiment for only a few hours, a Greek election outcome as good as could have been hoped did not buoy markets for even a day. There could be no clearer evidence that the strategy of vowing that th... Read More
Jun 03, 2012 - Look beyond interest rates to get out of the gloom
June 3, 2012
With the past week’s dismal US jobs data, signs of increasing financial strain in Europe and discouraging news from China, the proposition that the global economy is returning to a path of healthy growth looks highly implausible.
It is more likely that a pessimistic view is again taking over as falling incomes lead to falling con... Read More

Mar 25, 2012 - How to ensure stimulus today, austerity tomorrow
March 25, 2012
Economic forecasters divide into two groups. There are those who cannot know the future but think they can – and then there are those who recognise their inability to know the future. Major shifts in the economy are rarely forecast and often not fully recognised until they have been under way for some time. So judgments about the ... Read More
Jan 08, 2012 - Current woes call for smart reinvention not destruction
January 8, 2012
It would have been almost unimaginable five years ago that the Financial Times would convene a series of articles on “Capitalism in Crisis”. That it has done so is a reflection both of sour public opinion and distressing results on the ground in much of the industrial world.

For some time now, the large flow of capital from the developing to the industrialised world has been the principal irony of the international financial system.

Over the past 20 years major financial disruptions have taken place roughly every three years, starting with the 1987 stock market crash; the Savings & Loans collapse and credit crunch of the early 1990s; the 1994 Mexican crisis; the Asian financial crises of 1997 with the Russian and Long-Term Capital Management events of 19...

Oct 09, 2012 - Beware moral hazard fundamentalists
September 23, 2007
Central to every policy discussion in response to a financial crisis or the prospect of a crisis is the concept of moral hazard. Unfortunately, there is great confusion in many quarters about the circumstances when moral hazard is, and is not, a problem. The world has at least as much to fear from a moral hazard fundamentalism... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - How to handle the falling dollar
October 28, 2007
The falling dollar generates anxiety almost everywhere. Americans and those dependent on American growth worry about the proverbial “hard landing” as inflation and interest rates rise with a weakening dollar, causing asset prices and output to fall. Europeans and others with currencies that float freely against the dollar worry ... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - Wake up to the dangers of a deepening crisis
November 25, 2007
Three months ago it was reasonable to expect that the subprime credit crisis would be a financially significant event but not one that would threaten the overall pattern of economic growth. This is still a possible outcome but no longer the preponderant probability.
Even if necessary changes in policy are implemented, the od... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - Beyond fiscal stimulus, further action is needed
January 27, 2008
Markets and perceptions of the economic outlook change rapidly. Even two months ago most observers doubted predictions of a US recession, saw no need for a fiscal stimulus, and thought that inflation fears should constrain monetary policy. Now, Washington is more or less settled on a stimulus package that will exceed $150bn; mar... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - America needs a way to stem foreclosures
February 24, 2008
The American economic outlook remains highly uncertain. But macroeconomic policy is now properly aligned, as the economy will benefit over the next several quarters from fiscal and monetary stimulus. To the extent conditions warrant and inflation risks permit, monetary and fiscal policy are appropriately poised to provide furt... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - Steps that can safeguard America’s economy
March 31, 2008
Neither US financial institutions nor the economy are likely to suffer from a lack of central bank liquidity provision. New lending facilities are coming along almost weekly, the safety net has been expanded to include non-bank primary dealers, the Fed has demonstrated a willingness to take on directly the most problematic parts o...

Oct 09, 2012 - America needs to make a new case for trade
April 27, 2008
While the financial crisis dominates current discussion on the US economy, questions regarding America’s future approach to globalisation are looming increasingly large.
Since the end of the second world war, American economic policy has supported an integrated global economy, stimulating development in poor countries, particul... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - A strategy to promote healthy globalisation
May 4, 2008
Last week, in this column, I argued that making the case that trade agreements improve economic welfare might no longer be sufficient to maintain political support for economic internationalism in the US and other countries. Instead, I suggested that opposition to trade agreements, and economic internationalism more generally, reflec... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - Six principles for a new regulatory order
June 1, 2008
After a modest interval with no big financial shocks, policy attention is turning to the task of preventing future crises and managing those that occur. While the deliberations will take quite a while to play out, there is some time pressure – because of the moral hazards created by the Federal Reserve’s extension of credit to inves... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - What we can do in this dangerous moment
June 29, 2008
It is quite possible that we are now at the most dangerous moment since the American financial crisis began last August. Staggering increases in the prices of oil and other commodities have brought American consumer confidence to new lows and raised serious concerns about inflation, thereby limiting the capacity of monetary policy ...

Oct 09, 2012 - How to build a US recovery
August 7, 2008
Macroeconomists, like medical scientists, use case studies to teach their students about the maladies to which the system is susceptible. For supply shocks and stagflation, the example is the 1970s. The financial dislocations that occur when bubbles burst are illustrated by the Great Depression and Japan's problems in the 1990s. T... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - The global consensus on trade is unravelling, August 24 2008
With two wars still continuing and violence in Georgia dominating the foreign policy debate; and with the financial crisis and economic insecurity for families dominating the domestic debate, US international economic policy is receiving less attention in this presidential election year than usual. The limited attention it has received has focused ... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - The $700bn bail-out and the budget
September 28, 2008
Congressional negotiators have now completed action on a $700bn authorisation for the bail-out of the financial sector. This step was as necessary as the need for it was regrettable. There are hugely important tactical issues regarding the deployment of these funds that the authorities will need to consider in the weeks and mo... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - Taxpayers can still benefit from a bail-out
September 29, 2008
Congressional negotiators have now completed action on a $700bn authorisation for the bail-out of the financial sector. This step was as necessary as the need for it was regrettable. There are hugely important tactical issues regarding the deployment of these funds that the authorities will need to consider in the weeks and mo... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - The pendulum swings towards regulation
October 27, 2008
Events as well as ideas shape policy choices in democracies. Who would have predicted a year ago that a Republican ad-ministration would demand that Congress make the largest set of investments in public companies in US peacetime history? Would anyone have supposed that President George W. Bush would convene a global effort to r... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - America’s sensible stance on recovery
July 18, 2010
Economic commentators are mired in an unhelpful dialectic between “jobs” and “deficits” that, despite its apparent simplicity, has obscured rather than clarified the policy choices ahead in the US, Europe and elsewhere.
Critics have complained that the continued commitment by the administration of President Barack Obama to suppo... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - How to avoid our own lost decade
June 12, 2011
Even with the 2008-2009 policy effort that successfully prevented financial collapse, the US is now halfway to a lost economic decade. In the past five years, our economy’s growth rate averaged less than one per cent a year, similar to Japan when its bubble burst. At the same time, the fraction of the population working has fallen ... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - How to save the eurozone
July 18, 2011
With last week’s tumult in Italian markets, the European financial crisis has entered a new and far more dangerous phase. Where the crisis had been existential for small economies on the periphery of Europe but not systemically threatening to either the idea of European monetary union or to the functioning of the global financial s...

Oct 09, 2012 - Time is of the essence, any US budget deal will do
July 12, 2011
As the debt negotiators square off in Congress, much attention will focus on the size of the 10-year budget deal they come up with. As almost everyone agrees, there is much more risk of doing too little than too much given the scale of America’s fiscal challenge.
The truth is that the expected impact of the deal over a 10-year p... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - The world must insist that Europe act
September 18, 2011
In his celebrated essay “The Quagmire Myth and the Stalemate Machine”, published in 1972, Daniel Ellsberg drew out the lesson regarding the Vietnam war that came out of the 8,000 pages of the Pentagon Papers, which he had secretly copied a few years earlier. It was simply this: policymakers acted without illusion. At every jun... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - The way forward for Fannie and Freddie
July 27, 2008
Anyone who cares about the health of the US economy should welcome the enactment of the Treasury’s rescue plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, along with other measures to support the housing market. While there is room for argument about details, the risks to the financial system were too great to allow delay.
No one should sup... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - Relief at an agreement will give way to alarm
August 2, 2011
At last Washington has reached a deal that raises the debt limit and averts a default that would have been a national embarrassment and an economic and geopolitical catastrophe. The forces shaping the deal and the deal itself are multifaceted and so also is the right reaction to it. Mine has a number of elements.
The first is r... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - Why the housing burden stalls America’s economic recovery
October 23, 2011
Construction of new single family homes has plummeted from about 1.7m in the middle of the last decade to about 450,000 at present. With housing starts averaging well over a million during the 1990s, the shortfall in housing construction now dwarfs the excess during the bubble and is the largest single component of the shortfall...

Oct 09, 2012 - Five grim and essential lessons for world leaders
November 2, 2011
Leaders of the Group of 20 big industrial and developing countries first convened almost three years ago to address the financial crisis. As now, there were deep doubts about the financial fundamentals of a major economy. As now, authorities were struggling to bring Main Street the financial stability it needed, without going to...

Oct 09, 2012 - IMF must play its part in any euro solution
December 9, 2011
European leaders will meet on Thursday and Friday for yet another “historic” summit at which the fate of Europe is said to hang in the balance. Yet it is clear that this will not be the last meeting convened to deal with the financial crisis.
If public previews from France and Germany are a guide, there will be commitments to... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - Current woes call for smart reinvention not destruction
January 8, 2012
It would have been almost unimaginable five years ago that the Financial Times would convene a series of articles on “Capitalism in Crisis”. That it has done so is a reflection both of sour public opinion and distressing results on the ground in much of the industrial world.
Americans have traditionally been the most enthusias... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - How to ensure stimulus today, austerity tomorrow
March 25, 2012
Economic forecasters divide into two groups. There are those who cannot know the future but think they can – and then there are those who recognise their inability to know the future. Major shifts in the economy are rarely forecast and often not fully recognised until they have been under way for some time. So judgments about the ... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - Romney must release a credible budget
April 26, 2012
Political arithmetic is invariably suspect and one should always examine carefully the claims of those seeking votes. However, just as one should look at audited and unaudited financials very differently when deciding whether to invest in a company, smart observers have learnt to distinguish between the claims of political candida...

Oct 09, 2012 - Look beyond interest rates to get out of the gloom
June 3, 2012
With the past week’s dismal US jobs data, signs of increasing financial strain in Europe and discouraging news from China, the proposition that the global economy is returning to a path of healthy growth looks highly implausible.
It is more likely that a pessimistic view is again taking over as falling incomes lead to falling con... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - Time to act: euro collapse would define our era
June 18, 2012
Once again good news has had a half-life in the markets of less than 24 hours. Just as news of Spain’s bank bailout rallied markets and sentiment for only a few hours, a Greek election outcome as good as could have been hoped did not buoy markets for even a day. There could be no clearer evidence that the strategy of vowing that the ... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - Land of Opportunity Can Fight Inequality
July 15, 2012
Even if the process proves protracted, the American economy will eventually recover. Yet even as cyclical issues cease to dominate the economic conversation, it is likely that inequality will move to the forefront.
There is no question that income is distributed substantially more unequally than it was a generation ago, with tho... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - America’s state will expand whoever wins
August 19, 2012
With the selection of Paul Ryan as the Republican vice-presidential candidate, it is clear both political parties agree that the central issue in the presidential election will be the scale and scope of government involvement in the US economy. There will be disagreement over what constituted “normal” levels of spending in the pa... Read More
Oct 09, 2012 - Britain risks a lost decade unless it changes course
September 16, 2012
It is the mark of science and perhaps rational thought to operate with a falsifiable understanding of how the world works. So it is fair to ask economists a fundamental question: what could happen that would cause you to revise your views of how the economy operates and acknowledge that the model you had been using was flawed?...

Oct 09, 2012 - Global Leadership and Public Policy for the 21st Century
Lawrence H. Summers Remarks, March 30, 2011
I thought what I would do, actually, is something a little different than maybe some of your speakers have done. I’m going to be very brief, and I’m happy to talk about any economic or public policy question, or question about higher education that interests anybody here. But what I thought I would do...

★ Jun 04, 2025 - Stan Fischer
Stan Fischer was the most influential macroeconomist of his generation—not only to me, but to the world.

May 26, 2021 - Summers congratulates Ricardo Hausmann for 20 years at Harvard Kennedy School
Ricardo, congratulations on 20 remarkable years at the Kennedy School.
You know, I suppose when I was President of the University and you were a Professor at Harvard it could be said that I was your boss and I did have the privilege of appointing you as the head of the Center for International Development. But perhaps less well known is that in... Read More
Oct 22, 2020 - Many companies pay nothing in taxes. The public has a right to know how they pull it off.
By Lawrence Summers and Natasha Sarin

Corporations are increasingly recognizing the importance of being responsive not just to their shareholders but also to the interests of stakeholders, such as customers, employees and their communities. The corporate leaders of the Business Roundtable issued an announcement to that effect l... Read More
Sep 16, 2019 - A tribute to Marty Feldstein
It is hard for me to think about carrying on my career as an economist without Marty Feldstein.
I first met Marty in 1973, 46 years ago, when he hired me as part of his flotilla of a dozen or so research assistants.
My project involved extending Marty’s work on social security and saving by looking at international comparisons. I remember sho... Read More
Jun 18, 2019 - The Economist Who Helped Me Find My Calling
Martin S. Feldstein was a great economist who changed the world through research, teaching, public service, hundreds of op-eds in these pages over 40 years, and leadership of the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Marty, who died Tuesday, June 11, at 79, didn’t lack for recognition. He earned the American Economic Association’s John Bates Cla... Read More

By Anna Stansbury and Lawrence H. Summers
The Washington Post
May 31, 2019
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently released a thoughtful report highlighting a substantial issue in the American economy: the steady decline of American private investment.
The trend, Rubio contends, is the result of shareholder capitalism and corporate short-termism... Read More

Mar 21, 2019 - Alan Krueger helped make life better for millions who will never know his name
I have had no student of whom I have been prouder than Alan Krueger. It has taken me a few days since the shock of learning of his death to think of how I wanted to pay tribute to him.

Mar 20, 2019 - Responding to some of the critiques of our paper on secular stagnation and fiscal policy
My paper with Lukasz Rachel on secular stagnation and fiscal policy summarized here has attracted a number of interesting responses including from Martin Wolf, David Leonhardt, Martin Sandbu and Brad DeLong and also many participants at the Brookings conference.
I’m gratified that there seems to be general acceptance of the core secular stagnati... Read More

How Washington Should End Its Debt Obsession
By Jason Furman and Lawrence H. Summers

Jan 24, 2019 - Has economics failed us? Hardly
My friend Fareed Zakaria has celebrated his well-deserved recognition by Foreign Policy Magazine as one of the 10 most important foreign policy thinkers of the last decade by writing an essay entitled “The End of Economics,” doubting the relevance and utility of economics and economists. Because Fareed is so thoughtful, and echoes arguments that a... Read More
Oct 03, 2018 - Bringing accountability to powerful, unelected officials
It is often said that the chair of the Federal Reserve is the second most important person in Washington. I’m not sure the statement is exactly right, but that it is plausible is, in a sense, remarkable. Why should the second most important person in Washington not be elected by the people, or at least directly accountable to and subject to dismiss... Read More
Sep 20, 2018 - Trump exaggerates economic progress and takes credit he doesn’t deserve
Last week, the White House released a brief that, among other things, suggested I was wrong in claiming the president has taken credit for far more economic success than he deserves. It does not take long to compile evidence to support my mild claim.
First, President Trump misrepresents the actual conditions and trends of the economy he inherited ... Read More
Sep 13, 2018 - The financial crisis and the foundations for macroeconomics
A, if not the, preoccupation of macroeconomists for the last generation has been providing macroeconomics with a microeconomic foundation. At one level this totally makes sense. How can one be against establishing foundations? And it makes sense to think that macroeconomic theories of fluctuations in investment, for example, should be rooted in the... Read More
Sep 11, 2018 - Vaulting Workers Into the Middle Class With High Pay
Eduardo Porter has a thoughtful article in The New York Times on the “contractor parity” policy Harvard implemented during my Presidency. I thought at the time, and think now, that it was a good and important step for Harvard. The policy also serves as a valuable example for others, even if it’s not a panacea.
Harvard was at the time and still i... Read More
Sep 03, 2018 - Setting the Record Straight on Secular Stagnation
Joseph Stiglitz recently dismissed the relevance of secular stagnation to the American economy, and in the process attacked (without naming me) my work in the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. I am not a disinterested observer, but this is not the first time that I find Stiglitz’s policy commentary as weak as his academic... Read More

Apr 26, 2018 - How to actually help Puerto Rico
Desmond Lachman, Brad Setser and Antonio Weiss have written a strong analysis of the Puerto Rico situation.

Feb 28, 2018 - No, “Obamasclerosis” wasnt a real problem for the economy
The Wall Street Journal's Greg Ip, reviewing the Trump administration’s first Council of Economic Advisers report, finds credible its claims that President Barack Obama’s policies, particularly in his second term, materially slowed economic growth, even though Ip acknowledges that the CEA’s assertions regarding magnitudes are likely exaggerated.

Feb 06, 2018 - Wells Fargo’s board members are getting off too easily
A question I am asked as frequently as any other is: “Why didn’t anyone go to jail for the financial crisis?” There was huge suffering, sufficient misbehavior that the largest banks had to pay well over $100 billion in fines, and in the past, people had gone to jail for financial shenanigans during the Depression and the S&L crisis. People are ... Read More
Jan 30, 2018 - In memoriam Bill McDonough
William “Bill” McDonough was my friend. We met in January 1993 when I took up my new position leading international affairs at the Treasury Department, and Bill was preparing to become president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. For the next eight years we probably spoke twice a week and much more frequently in times of crisis. I learned more f... Read More
Jan 25, 2018 - Why Treasury Secretaries should stick with the strong dollar mantra
Yesterday in Davos, Secretary Mnuchin left the impression that he might be reversing 25 years of US Treasury strong dollar policy by asserting that, “Obviously a weaker dollar is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities.” The dollar then had its biggest one day decline in nearly a year and bond yields rose. Commerce Secretary Ross lat... Read More
Jan 18, 2018 - If we want to improve global health, we need to start taxing the things that are killing us
The world is going through a huge health transition, where the problems of the six billion people who live in emerging markets are increasingly the problems of the one billion people who live in rich countries. For the first time in history, more people suffer from eating too many calories than too few. Improving global health is no longer primaril... Read More
Dec 12, 2017 - We are even more convinced that thousands will die prematurely if the ACA is repealed
On Monday, The Washington Post published an article by Casey Mulligan and Tomas Philipson attacking Lawrence Summers’s statement that “thousands” of individuals would die if the Republican tax bill became law. Summers reached his estimate after carefully reviewing the literature and consulting with health economists Jonathan Gruber and Mulligan and... Read More
Dec 05, 2017 - Susan Collins is wrong to say that the tax cuts will pay for themselves, despite the economists she cites
Senator Susan Collins speaking on “Meet the Press” defended her vote on the Senate GOP tax bill based on the claims of the signatories to the nine economists' letter that we have criticized over the last week. The Maine Republican explained: “If you take the CBO’s formula and apply it, just four-tenths of one percent increase in the GDP generates r... Read More
Dec 04, 2017 - Thousands would die as a consequence of the GOP tax bill
I suggested on Friday when it became clear that the tax bill would pass that “thousands would die.” In light of my sharp criticisms of other economists claims regarding the tax bill, some have asked whether my statement is well grounded. I believe so, but this should be open to debate.
In reaching my judgement I relied primarily on work by Kate... Read More
Nov 30, 2017 - Dear Colleagues: You responded, but we have more questions about your tax-cut analysis
Dear colleagues:
We appreciate that in response to our questions you clarified a number of points in your letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and, in particular, that you are backing off the statement in your original letter that “the gain in the long-run level of GDP would be just over 3%, or 0.3% per year for a decade.” As you state in...

Nov 28, 2017 - Trump’s version of capitalism looks a lot like revenge — and it endangers our democracy
In response to the Carrier caper after the election last year, I decried the Trump administration’s preference for what I called ad hoc deal capitalism. I noted that the practice was characteristic of developing countries and earlier times in the United States and that it was much less conducive to prosperity and freedom than capitalism based on th...

Oct 26, 2017 - What I do support in a new tax plan
I have been very sharply critical of what I regard as unprofessional exaggeration by advocates of the Trump tax proposal. Reasonably enough, people have asked what I am for.

Oct 24, 2017 - The Business Roundtable’s outlandish tax cut claims
I think of myself as pro-business. I frequently counselled the Obama Administration that “business confidence is the cheapest form of stimulus” and during my times in government have found meetings with business leaders very helpful in understanding economic policy challenges. So when the Business Roundtable (BRT) does an analysis I pay close att... Read More
Oct 22, 2017 - One last time on who benefits from corporate tax cuts
I recently asserted that Kevin Hassett deserved a failing grade for his “analysis” projecting that the Trump administration proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent would raise the wages of an average American family between $4,000 to $9,000. I chose harsh language because Hassett had, for what seemed like political reasons, ... Read More
Oct 17, 2017 - Hassett’s flawed analysis of Trump tax plan
Kevin Hassett accuses me of an ad-hominem attack against his economic analysis of the Trump Administration’s tax plan. I am proudly guilty of asserting that it is some combination of dishonest, incompetent and absurd. TV does not provide space to spell out the reasons why, so I am happy to provide them here.
I believe strongly in civility in p... Read More
Oct 13, 2017 - Corporations would surely benefit from a Trump tax cut — but probably at their workers’ expense
October 13, 2017
I did an interview with Sara Eisen and Scott Wapner on CNBC on Thursday afternoon. During the interview Scott challenged my criticisms of the Trump administration's tax cut and asserted that such a cut would be sound policy for the economy by noting that Jamie Dimon is in favor of it. Scott noted that the JP Morgan chairman and ... Read More
Sep 28, 2017 - Trump could help Puerto Rico with the stroke of a pen. Why hasn’t he?
My modestly-informed guess is that Hurricane Maria and Puerto Rico will appear in history textbooks right next to Katrina and New Orleans. Puerto Rico’s unique territorial status and institutional constraints make the federal government’s response very difficult. And as I shall suggest in a subsequent post, the hurricane has greatly exacerbated Pue... Read More
Sep 21, 2017 - Opportunity for Republican Senators to be 21st century Profiles in Courage
There is an opportunity for 1 or 2 Republican Senators to be 21st century Profiles in Courage. A Senator who stands up to his or her party and casts the decisive vote against the Cassidy Graham health legislation will be seen by history as a hero.
Cassidy Graham is the cruelest and most misguided piece of consequential legislation proposed so f... Read More
Sep 12, 2017 - Why the US government can’t be downsized
Speaking at an event organized by Robert Greenstein, the President of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, I argued last week that unless our values have changed profoundly in an antigovernment direction, the balance of pressures from economic change will lead to an expansion of the federal budget relative to GDP. This was also the conclusi... Read More
Sep 07, 2017 - Stan Fischer’s departure from the Fed: End of an era
Stan Fischer announced yesterday that he is leaving his position as Vice Chair of the Fed. The Fed and the international monetary system will be weaker for his departure from official responsibility. It is the end of an era.
Stan's has been a singular career. As an MIT professor he coauthored, with his close friend Rudi Dornbusch, the macro t... Read More
Sep 05, 2017 - Cohn had a bad day with facts
Given recent controversies, I was interested to read NEC chair Gary Cohn’s answer to a “why are you staying?” question put by Stuart Varney of Fox Business Network last week. To his credit Cohn did not back away from his reservations about the President’s response to Charlottesville. He said “Look, tax cuts are really important to me. I think it’s... Read More
Aug 25, 2017 - Issues under discussion at Jackson Hole
I will not be attending Jackson Hole this year but I will be thinking about some of the issues under discussion.

Even though the Fed has raised rates mo... Read More
Aug 17, 2017 - Trump’s CEOs resigned. His staff should do the same.
President Trump, recognizing the inevitable, has disbanded his Business Advisory Councils in order to preempt the tidal wave of resignations that was in the offing. Given my long standing views about CEOs lending legitimacy to the Trump administration, I was delighted that a group of CEOs forced this step.
It is a stunning development with more... Read More

Jul 12, 2017 - Western civilization and Presidential hypocrisy
President Trump’s Poland speech articulating his foreign policy principles has generated much comment and would have generated more but for all the Russia scandal news.

Jul 08, 2017 - Our President is the greatest threat to our security
In the run-up to the ongoing G20 meeting in Hamburg, I was interviewed by the G20 Research Group about its significance. I argued that the only really important issue was whether the United States would at last be induced to signal a commitment to the idea of a global community or would it double down on atavism.
As I write Saturday morning (US ... Read More
Jun 14, 2017 - 5 reasons why the Fed may be making a mistake
While I do not believe the Fed made a serious mistake Wednesday in raising rates, I believe that the “preemption of inflation based on the Phillips curve” paradigm within which it is operating is highly problematic. Much better would be a “shoot only when you see the whites of the eyes of inflation” paradigm of the kind I have advocated for the pa... Read More
Jun 12, 2017 - The problem with privatization
We tend in modern economies to take progress for granted and debate only its pace. This is not true with respect to air travel times. A look at airline time tables reveals that today the 8:26 a.m. flight from Boston to Washington National took 103 minutes. The 8:15 a.m. flight in 1982 took 82 minutes. The difference is similar, if not greater, on ... Read More
May 30, 2017 - What history tells us about Trump’s budget fantasy
At the risk of beating a dead horse, here are some thoughts on the Trump administration’s 3 percent growth forecast. Zero interest rates seemed inconceivable 15 years ago, and yet they happened. Almost no one forecast the productivity boom that took place in the United States between 1995 and 2005 or the magnitude of the 2008 financial crisis. So a... Read More
May 24, 2017 - Trump’s “China deal” is only a good deal for China
The events of the last week have crowded out reflection on economic policy. But things have been happening. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross described the trade deal reached with China earlier this month as “pretty much a herculean accomplishment….This is more than has been done in the history of U.S.-China relations on trade.”
Past a certain poi... Read More
May 23, 2017 - Trump’s budget is simply ludicrous
Details of President Trump’s first budget have now been released. Much can and will be said about the dire social consequences about what is in it and the ludicrously optimistic economic assumptions it embodies. My observation is that there appears to be a logical error of the kind that would justify failing a student in an introductory economics... Read More
May 21, 2017 - Five suggestions for avoiding another banking collapse
Several weeks ago I gave a talk based on my Brookings paper with Natasha Sarin at the Atlanta Fed’s annual research conference. Here are the video and slides. I continue to be puzzled by gap between what is widely believed and my reading of market evidence.
I began by highlighting three facts that seem to me to be in substantial tension with th... Read More
May 02, 2017 - This time, Trump’s treasury secretary is undermining himself
Last week I suggested that I felt sorry for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. He found himself forced by circumstance and his president to say and do things that undermined his and Treasury's credibility.
I wish there was an external force that could be blamed for the secretary's comments on Monday, but they look from the outside like unforced ... Read More
May 02, 2017 - The future of banking
I had a keynote conversation last week with my friend Markus Brunnermeier on fintech and the future of finance at a conference he held at Princeton. Markus got me to think about a number of different aspects of fintech that I hadn’t fully considered before. Some of the main points I tried to make were:
Fintech is ultimately about taking away f... Read More
Apr 28, 2017 - Trump is undermining his own Treasury Secretary
President Trump's tax proposals were rolled out yesterday by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and NEC Director Cohn. For reasons of long run budget health, fairness, and economic impact I think they are extraordinarily ill-advised. I am certain that the substantive concerns I have will be extensively addressed in the debates to come.
As I read about ... Read More
Mar 27, 2017 - The robots are coming, whether Trump’s Treasury Secretary admits it or not
As I learned (sometimes painfully) during my time at the Treasury Department, words spoken by Treasury secretaries can over time have enormous consequences, and therefore should be carefully considered. In this regard, I am very surprised by two comments made by Secretary Steven Mnuchin in his first public interview last week.
In reference to a ... Read More
Mar 24, 2017 - Why scrapping NAFTA would be Trump’s big gift to China
I was in Mexico Thursday seeing the Mexican president, foreign minister and finance minister and addressing a convention of bankers. The only subjects anyone is interested is the future of NAFTA and U.S. Mexican relations.
I came to Mexico from Beijing, and so I was able to report that there was no greater strategic gift the United States could ... Read More
Feb 28, 2017 - A correction to my farewell to Kenneth Arrow
In my tribute to Kenneth Arrow, I asserted that he was unique among economists in having a theorem named after him. He may be unique in having an impossibility theorem named after him, and his may be the most profound theorem named after an economist, but my statement was wrong. Alas I was for the first time writing about economic theory without... Read More
Feb 09, 2017 - Case Still Out on Whether Corporate Short-Termism Is a Problem
McKinsey has a new study out on an important topic—the question of whether corporations systematically take too short a view and do not invest enough for the long term. If true -- as many CEOs believe -- this is a serious indictment of current corporate governance arrangements and has important policy implications. To take one close to ... Read More
Feb 09, 2017 - US adoption of a carbon tax would encourage others to follow
Ideas should be judged by their quality not their pedigree. I am not usually a fan of Republican tax policy proposals or environmental initiatives. But I strongly support the proposal put forward yesterday by Republicans George Shultz, James Baker, Martin Feldstein, Hank Paulson, Greg Mankiw and others for a substantial carbon tax in the USA to ad...

Feb 07, 2017 - Big risks in the hasty rollback of financial regulation
Many business people think it is wonderful that we now have an Administration filled with people from business backgrounds. To a point, I relate. People who have worked primarily in the private sector bring an awareness that others sometimes lack of maintaining business confidence, which as I have often said is the cheapest form of stimulus. And fo... Read More
Jan 29, 2017 - Markets enjoying a sugar high that will not last
This week the Trump rally continued as the Dow crossed 20,000 and our President issued a celebratory tweet. How much does this mean? To what extent is it a vindication of the economic policy approaches pursued by the new Administration? Will the post election rally continue? No one knows these answer and market timing is a fool’s game but I remain ... Read More
Jan 24, 2017 - Time for Business Leaders To Wake Up
I wonder what the business leaders who have been waxing enthusiastic about our new pro-business Administration are thinking right now.
Confidence and prosperity depend on a perception of government credibility and confidence. Is that present when an administration lies about readily observable facts like crowd sizes and then defends the lie with... Read More
Jan 20, 2017 - Disillusioned in Davos
Edmund Burke famously cautioned that “the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.” I have been reminded of Burke’s words as I have observed the behavior of US business leaders in Davos over the last few days. They know better but in their public rhetoric they have embraced and enabled our new President and his ... Read More
Jan 18, 2017 - Congress is considering an extremely dangerous idea almost nobody has heard of
Inevitably, Congress has more attractive uses for new funds than it has sources of new funds, so there is always is a desperate search for “pay-fors” — measures that are scored by the Congressional Budget Office as raising revenue or reducing outlays and so can be used to finance new initiatives. The pressure is particularly acute this year with th... Read More
Jan 17, 2017 - The case for a proper program of infrastructure spending
On Monday, I gave a speech at Brookings and then had a discussion with my Harvard colleague Ed Glaeser on aspects of infrastructure investment. Here are the links to the video and transcript. While for reasons described below I believe the Trump campaign proposals are wholly ill-conceived, I remain convinced that an increased and improved programme... Read More
Jan 16, 2017 - Public Infrastructure Investment in the National Interest
On Monday, I gave a speech at Brookings and then had a discussion with my Harvard colleague Ed Glaeser on aspects of infrastructure investment. Here are the links to the video and transcript. While for reasons described below I believe the Trump campaign proposals are wholly ill conceived, I remain convinced that an increased and improved program... Read More
Dec 02, 2016 - Trump’s Carrier Deal – Ad Hoc Deal Capitalism
There are many aspects of the economic policy of the new Administration that I find misguided. But I am most troubled by what the President-elect did with Carrier to hold on to an extra 700 jobs in Indiana. Ronald Reagan’s response to the air traffic controllers’ strike was a small act that had profound consequences. I fear in a similar way that ... Read More
Dec 01, 2016 - The Future of Aid for Health
Yesterday, I gave a keynote speech at the World Innovation Summit for Health on “The Future of Aid for Health”. When I agreed to give the speech, which built on the work of a Commission I chaired several years ago on Global Health 2035, I did not imagine the degree of uncertainty that the US election would bring to the global health area and indee...

Nov 29, 2016 - Castro is Dead
As I read the obituaries and saw reactions to Fidel Castro’s death I was struck by two things.
First, history will judge the US embargo policy a total failure. Suppose it's authors had been told nearly 60 years ago that The Berlin Wall will fall. The Iron Curtain will fall. The USSR will break into 15 separate nations. Central Europe will join N... Read More
Nov 21, 2016 - Most sweeping change in currency policy in the world in decades
By Natasha Sarin and Lawrence H. Summers
One of us (Larry) has long advocated the abolition of the $100 note in the US context and the 500 euro note (aka the Bin Laden) in the European context. We assumed the next step after the ECB’s announcement that the 500 euro note would be phased out would be discussion of the $100 bill and of the particu... Read More
Nov 17, 2016 - Winning an election does not entitle one to upend basic values
I will never again use the term “political correctness.” Whatever rhetorical value the term may have once had is far more than offset by what has been unleashed in the name of resistance to it since the presidential election.
I have made no secret over the years of my conviction that the sensitivities of individuals or members of various group s... Read More
Sep 30, 2016 - Four things the Fed should do now to help the economy
On Tuesday, I spoke in Houston at a forum sponsored by the Dallas Federal Reserve. Inevitably given that I was at the Fed, the topic turned to monetary policy. On monetary policy, President Kaplan asked what I thought the Fed should be doing and saying. I suggested four modifications to its current posture.
First, it should acknowledge that th... Read More
Sep 29, 2016 - A Tribute to Shimon Peres
I have been thinking all day about Shimon Peres and how much I will miss him. I first got to know Shimon in the mid 1990s when I was working in the International Affairs section of the Treasury. It was a time of more optimism than we have today about the efficacy of economic assistance in supporting harmony among nations. We were intensely engag... Read More
Sep 26, 2016 - Men Without Work
Over the weekend, the FT published my review of Nicholas Eberstadt’s important new book Men Without Work. The core message is captured in the graph below.
Job destruction caused by technology is not a futuristic concern. It is something we have been l... Read More
Sep 06, 2016 - The Fed’s complacency about its current toolbox is unwarranted
As I argued in the first blog in this series last week, I was disappointed in what came out of Jackson Hole for three reasons. The first reason, developed in that blog, was that the Fed should have signaled a desire to exceed its two percent inflation target during periods of protracted recovery and low unemployment and in this context to signal ... Read More
Aug 29, 2016 - Disappointed by what came out of Jackson Hole
I had high hopes for the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole conference. The conference was billed as a forum that would look at new approaches to the conduct of monetary policy—something that I have been urging as necessary given secular stagnation risks and the sharp decline in the apparent neutral rate of interest. And Chair Yellen’s speech ... Read More
Aug 18, 2016 - A Thought Provoking Essay from Fed President William
John Williams has written the most thoughtful piece on monetary policy that has come out of the Fed in a long time. He recognizes more explicitly than others that r* (r-star), the neutral interest rate, is now very low and quite likely will remain very low for a long time to come. As he recognizes, this the essence of the secular stagnation conce... Read More
Jul 25, 2016 - Two Good Men
Two longtime friends of mine, Chip Case and Michael Elliot, died within the last week after battles with long illnesses. In different ways, they illustrated something I think is very important—that you can think superbly as an economist and act and live in an extraordinarily humane way.
Chip was a professor at Wellesley for the last forty years... Read More
Jul 14, 2016 - When the best umps blow a call
CBO is an American national treasure. Without the impartial objectivity it brings to the budget process our country would make much worse policy. Baseball without an umpire would be a very different game, and similarly the making of budget policy without CBO would be a very different and inferior activity. However, even the best umps occasionally b... Read More
Jul 06, 2016 - A Remarkable Financial Moment
The US 10 and 30 year interest rates today reached all time low levels of 1.32 percent and 2.10 percent. Record low 10 year interest rate were also registered in Germany, France, Switzerland and Australia. Notably Swiss 50 year interest rates are now for the first time negative. Rates out 15 years are negative in Germany and 9 years in France.

Jun 24, 2016 - Why Brexit is worse for Europe than Britain
Brexit is in train. If journalism is the rough draft of history, instant blog responses are even cruder responses to events. Nonetheless, here are some thoughts prior to market opening in the United States.
Markets
So far given the shock value of what has happened the market response has been on the calm side. The British pound is only a bi... Read More
Jun 21, 2016 - Why Brexit would be a history-defining, irreversible mistake
U.K. voters will decide on Thursday whether or not the U.K will withdraw from the European Union. At one level it is a fundamental political choice. Does the U.K. want to face the world alone as a limited scale island nation or to remain an influential part of the European Union—the world’s largest economy? Does the U.K. want to stand apart from ... Read More
Jun 14, 2016 - Groundhog Day at Fed June meeting
As the Fed meets today and tomorrow, I am increasingly convinced that while they have been making reasonable tactical judgements their current strategy is ill adapted to the realities of the moment. Exuding soundness is the task of policymakers. Provoking thought is the task of academics. So here are some not entirely formed reflections.
Japan’s... Read More
May 26, 2016 - Why Americans don’t trust goverment
I have an Op-Ed in the Boston Globe today on infrastructure addressing the issue of quality rather than quantity of investment. Rachel Lipson and I describe the fiasco that has emerged from what should have been a routine maintenance project on the Anderson Memorial Bridge over the Charles River next to my office. Though the bridge took only 11 m... Read More
May 24, 2016 - What you need to know about the next recession
How should we respond to the next recession? That was the topic of an event held by the Brooking's Hamilton Project where I spoke on Monday in Washington with White House budget director Sean Donovan. I argued a number of points that address issues of current concern.
First, I argued that the possible election of “Demagogue Donald” dwarfs congre... Read More
Apr 04, 2016 - Data collection is the ultimate public good.
On Wednesday I spoke at a World Bank conference on price statistics. While price statistics are not usually thought of as a scintillating subject, I got a great deal of satisfaction out of preparing and presenting my remarks. In part this was because my late father Robert Summers focused his economic research on International price comparisons. ... Read More
Apr 01, 2016 - If we really valued excellence, we would single it out.
Catherine Rampell’s column this week reminded me of an issue that has long interested me as an economist and as a president of Harvard.
I remember many years ago listening to some monetarist quote Milton Friedman one too many times with "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon." I responded "what about grade inflation?"
I co... Read More
Mar 31, 2016 - Vast double standard on American college campuses
It has seemed to me that a vast double standard regarding what constitutes prejudice exists on American college campuses. There is hypersensitivity regarding prejudice against most minority groups but what might be called hyper-insensitivity with respect to anti-Semitism.
At Bowdoin College, holding parties with sombreros and tequila is deemed ... Read More
Mar 30, 2016 - Corporate profits are near record highs. Here’s why that’s a problem.
As the cover story in this week’s Economist highlights, the rate of profitability in the United States is at a near-record high level, as is the share of corporate revenue going to capital. The stock market is valued very high by historical standards, as measured by Tobin’s q ratio of the market value of the nonfinancial corporations to the value... Read More
Mar 01, 2016 - Trump’s rise illustrates how democratic processes can lose their way
While comparisons between Donald Trump and Mussolini or Hitler are overwrought, Trump’s rise does illustrate how democratic processes can lose their way and turn dangerously toxic when there is intense economic frustration and widespread apprehension about the future. This is especially the case when some previously respected leaders scurry to make... Read More
Feb 25, 2016 - In defense of killing the $100 bill
By Peter Sands and Lawrence Summers
Our advocacy for ending the printing of high denomination notes — first in a working paper by Peter and colleagues and, later in a post by Larry — have been attacked on the ground that this proposal represents an infringement on liberty (for example, see here and here). Most prominently, the Wall Street Journ... Read More
Feb 17, 2016 - Increasingly Convinced of the Secular Stagnation Hypothesis
Foreign Affairs has just published my latest on the secular stagnation hypothesis. I am increasingly convinced that it captures what is going on in the industrialized world and that the risks of long term weakness on the current policy path are growing.
Unfortunately since I put forward the argument in late 2013, the data have been all too supp... Read More
Feb 16, 2016 - It’s Time To Go After Big Money
The Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard that I am privileged to direct has just issued an important paper by Senior Fellow Peter Sands and a group of student collaborators. Sands’ paper makes a compelling case for stopping the issuance of high denomination notes like the 500 euro note and 100 dollar bill or even withdraw... Read More
Jan 13, 2016 - Global security and pandemic risk
I was privileged this morning to deliver keynote remarks at the release event for the Global Health Risk Framework Commission report on “The Neglected Dimension of Global Security: A Framework to Counter Infectious Disease Crises”. The commission, convened by the National Academy of Medicine and chaired by Peter Sands, has delivered a very importa... Read More
Jan 02, 2016 - A postscript to Delong and Krugman
P.S.
Brad is unpersuaded by my response. He is broadly right in my view that models function both as discovery tools and as ways of organizing and codifying thought. The danger comes when too primitive a model is regarded as too powerful a discovery. Thus Krugman was right to recognize that first generation models of currenc... Read More
Jan 01, 2016 - Thoughts on Delong and Krugman blogs
Brad Delong and Paul Krugman accept my criticisms of Fed thought regarding their monetary policy strategy but disagree with my assertion that it reflects an excessive attachment to existing models and modes of thought.
Their argument is that standard IS-LM leads to the conclusion you should not raise rates in the present environment so no move a... Read More
Dec 29, 2015 - The Fed and Financial Reform – Reflections on Sen. Sanders op-Ed
Bernie Sanders had an op Ed in the New York Times on Fed reform last week that provides an opportunity to reflect on the Fed and financial reform more generally. I think that Sanders is right in his central point that financial policy is overly influenced by financial interests to its detriment and that it is essential that this be repaired. At the...

Dec 22, 2015 - My views and the Fed’s views on secular stagnation
It has been two years since I resurrected Alvin Hansen’s secular stagnation idea and suggested its relevance to current conditions in the industrial world. Unfortunately experience since that time has tended to confirm the secular stagnation hypothesis. Secular stagnation is a possibility. It is not an inevitability and it can be avoided with st... Read More
Dec 15, 2015 - What Should the Fed Do and Have Done?
The Federal Reserve meets this week and has strongly signaled that it will raise rates. Given the strength of the signals that have been sent it would be credibility destroying not to carry through with the rate increase so there is no interesting discussion to be had about what should be done on Wednesday.
There is an interesting counterfactua... Read More
Dec 14, 2015 - Breaking new ground on neutral rates
Lukasz Rachel and Thomas Smith have a terrific new paper on world neutral real rates. The fact that it supports a variety of arguments that I have been making on secular stagnation for the last two years may contribute to my enthusiasm but the paper breaks new ground in a number of respects.
First, Rachel and Smith document compellingly the near... Read More
Nov 09, 2015 - This $13 trillion question is more important than ever
The Hutchins Center for Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings is having a conference launching an important new volume on federal debt management policy. Just as in the Great War in became clear that war is too important to be left to generals, so too in the Great Recession it became clear that (government) debt management is too important to be...

Nov 03, 2015 - Advanced economies are so sick we need a new way to think about them
An ebook containing the papers and presentations from the European Central Bank’s central banking forum conference in Sintra Portugal is now available. Mario Draghi and his colleagues are to be greatly commended for running a forum that is so open to profound challenges to central banking orthodoxy.
The volume contains a paper by Olivier Blancha... Read More
Nov 02, 2015 - Where Paul Krugman and I differ on secular stagnation and demand
Paul Krugman suggests that I have had some kind of change of heart on secular stagnation and converged towards his point of view, citing the publication of the transcript of a 2011 debate which we both participated in. I certainly appreciate the gravity of the secular stagnation issue more than I did a few years ago, given the continuing decline in... Read More
Oct 28, 2015 - This critique of the Fed isn’t backed by logic nor evidence
My friends Mike Spence and Kevin Warsh, writing in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal, have produced what seems to me the single most confused analysis of US monetary policy that I have read this year (Brad DeLong has expressed related views). Unless I am missing something -- which is certainly possible -- they make a variety of assertions that are u... Read More
Oct 28, 2015 - Plan for Puerto Rico should be the basis for prompt Congressional action
Last week, the Treasury announced their recommended approach to the profound economic and financial crisis engulfing How things play out from here will be an important test of whether or not Washington is, as some allege, controlled by financial interests.
The Puerto Rican economy has declined by more than 10 percent since 2006 and employment h... Read More
Oct 20, 2015 - Canadian elections proof that an anti-austerity message is a winning one
The Canadian liberal party won an overwhelming victory in yesterday’s election. Voters decisively rejected the ruling Conservative party and placed the Liberal Party far ahead of the left wing New Democratic Party. This is obviously important for Canada. But there are also two lessons here for American political observers.
First, polls often ... Read More
Oct 13, 2015 - Pandemic bonds have potential to be win-win-win
During the annual IMF-World Bank meetings last week in Lima, Peru, I was part of a discussion on a proposed pandemic emergency financing facility. The subject brought together two things I am very interested in. First, The Lancet Commission on Global Health 2035, which I recently chaired, argues that under-investment in health-related global public... Read More
Oct 13, 2015 - Another argument for infrastructure repair
There are many compelling arguments for increasing American infrastructure investment. Capital costs are exceptionally low. Construction labor is highly available. Materials costs are low as commodity prices have fallen. Investment is low by historic standards. Investing today relieves the burden for deferred maintenance from future generations.

Sep 24, 2015 - The Importance of Global Health Investment
One of the things I am proudest of having done in Washington was having the idea as Chief Economist of the World Bank that the Bank should devote its annual World Development Report to making the case for improving both the quantity and quality of global health investment. The 1993 report produced by a team led by Dean Jamison proved more influenti... Read More
Sep 21, 2015 - The relationship between Universities and the Military
I had occasion to address a gathering of Congressional Medal of Honor recipients visiting Harvard last week. It was an opportunity to reflect on the meaning of courage, and also on the relationship between universities and the military. Our freedom, including our academic freedom, depends on the existence of a strong military, and of people who are... Read More
Sep 17, 2015 - Good news from Ukraine
The Ukrainian parliament today voted to ratify Ukraine’s debt reduction deal by a massive majority embracing all major factions. This is important positive news in several respects. First, as I have explained elsewhere it enables Ukraine to get the various benefits of debt reduction. Second, the unity of support for Finance Minister Natalie Jare... Read More
Sep 17, 2015 - What to watch on Fed day
Today the Federal Reserve will makes its most consequential announcement in years. Much attention has rightly focused on whether the fed funds rate is increased. Ultimately though what matters is the posture of monetary policy, which depends on both the fed funds rate tomorrow and the path of expected rates. My views are clear; this is not the t... Read More
Sep 15, 2015 - Monetary policy should seek to avoid major surprises
In recent writings, I have laid out the strategic case against the Federal Reserve tightening this week. There is a compelling tactical case as well.
Monetary policy should seek to avoid major surprises. Right now the fed funds futures market is assigning only a 28 percent chance to a September tightening. In the last 20 years, the Fed has neve... Read More
Sep 14, 2015 - Why Ukraine’s debt deal is important not just for Ukraine, but for the West
I have spent the last two days in Kiev attending the Yalta European Strategy meeting, where I have had the chance to discuss Ukraine’s economic reform efforts with key officials, including the finance minister and prime minister. I was encouraged to see a country where, despite huge challenges, including Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine,... Read More
Sep 10, 2015 - Thoughts on Freeman’s Bargaining for the American Dream
Yesterday, I participated in a Center for American Progress forum where a new study on unions and social mobility was released. The study, by my Harvard colleague Richard Freeman and collaborators, showed a significant correlation across American metropolitan areas between the extent of union membership and social mobility. Freeman, who based his r... Read More
Sep 09, 2015 - Why the Fed must stand still on rates
Two weeks ago I argued that a Federal Reserve decision to raise rates in September would be a serious mistake. As I wrote my column, the market was assigning a 50 percent chance to a rate hike. The current chance is 34 percent. Having followed the debate among economists, Fed governors and bank presidents I believe the case against a rate increas... Read More
Sep 07, 2015 - Larry’s new blog
Over the summer, I have expanded my website to include a new blog that will enable me to comment on economic policy issues and current events more generally. I will continue to write my monthly Financial Times/Washington Post column, and their websites will also feature my blog content. This blog will enable me to address issues immediately, info...

Aug 29, 2015 - Thoughts on Ukrainian Debt Restructuring
I was very glad to see Ukraine reach a deal involving reduction in the principal value of its debt with major creditors. This would not have happened without the tenacity and determination of Ukrainian finance minister, Natalie Jaresko, and Ukraine’s political leadership. Congratulations also to the IMF and the U.S. Treasury for their strong effort... Read More
Jul 12, 2015 - The Astonishing Returns of Investing in Global Health R&D
By Lawrence H. Summers and Gavin Yamey
How to reach a “grand convergence” by 2035
We have a once-in-human-history opportunity to achieve a “grand convergence” in global health—a reduction in infectious, maternal, and child deaths down to universally low levels everywhere on the planet.
The Global Health 2035 report that we coauthored with ... Read More
Jul 04, 2015 - Tomorrow Greece votes
Tomorrow Greece votes. No one can know the outcome yet. Indeed, my bet is that a third of the voters are not yet sure how they will vote. If polls could not get the British election right, I doubt that they can get this one right. Anything can happen, and it would not surprise me if the vote is a landslide, one way or the other.
Many suppose tha... Read More
May 20, 2015 - Feldstein Argues Price Indices Underestimate Real Income Growth
Yesterday, in the Wall Street Journal, Marty Feldstein argues reasonably that conventional price indices underestimate real income growth because they take inadequate account of quality improvements and new products. Marty asserts very plausibly that properly measured real incomes and wages have not been completely stagnant in recent decades.

Apr 01, 2015 - On Secular Stagnation: A Response to Bernanke
Ben Bernanke has inaugurated his blog with a set of thoughtful observations on the determinants of real interest rates (see his post here) and the secular stagnation hypothesis that I have invoked in an effort to understand recent macroeconomic developments. I agree with much of what Ben writes and would highlight in particular his recognition tha... Read More
