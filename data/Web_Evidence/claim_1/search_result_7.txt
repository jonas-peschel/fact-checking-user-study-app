Latest Updates
- This update outlines Tax Foundation’s modeling and analysis of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as passed into law.
- President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law on July 4, 2025.
- This update adds refined modeling results reflecting the amendments made in the Senate to the final version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, now passed by both chambers of Congress to be signed by the president.
Key Findings
-
- Extending the expiring 2017 TaxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) would decrease federal tax revenue by $4.5 trillion from 2025 through 2034. Long-run GDP would be 1.1 percent higher, offsetting $710 billion, or 16 percent, of the revenue losses. Long-run GNP (a measure of American incomes) would only rise by 0.4 percent, as some of the benefits of the tax cuts and larger economy go to foreigners in the form of higher interest payments on the debt.
- President Trump has called for permanent extension of the 2017 tax cuts, additional policies— including no taxes on tips, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits for retirees—as well as creation of a deduction for auto loan interest for American made cars. He has also promised higher taxes on US imports through a series of new tariffs.
- Lawmakers will use the budget reconciliation process to enact new tax cuts. Reconciliation is a fast-track option that overcomes the Senate filibuster and can be used to enact tax, spending, and debt limit changes outlined in a budget resolution with specified targets or limits for deficit changes within the budget window.
- Separately from the reconciliation process in Congress, President Trump is imposing tariffs that will raise revenue and reduce economic output.
- Lawmakers have passed legislation called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” to make the expiring tax cuts permanent, provide additional tax cuts and changes to the tax code, and reduce spending.
- President Trump signed the bill into law on July 4, 2025.
The Latest
- On July 4, 2025: We estimate the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed into law will increase long-run GDP by 1.2 percent and reduce federal tax revenue by $5.0 trillion from 2025-2034 on a conventional basis. Dynamic feedback will reduce the revenue loss of the bill by about 19 percent to $4.1 trillion, while spending reductions of nearly $1.1 trillion will reduce the dynamic deficit increase to $3 trillion from 2025-2034.
- July 1, 2025: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act bill was amended before being passed out of the Senate.
- June 30, 2025: We estimate that the Senate Finance Committee’s version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” would increase long-run GDP by 1.2 percent and reduce federal tax revenue by $5 trillion between 2025 and 2034, on a conventional basis. Combined with the nearly $1.2 trillion in spending reductions estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), we estimate the Senate version of the OBBB would increase federal budget deficits by nearly $2.9 trillion from 2025 through 2034 on a dynamic basis.
- June 24, 2025: We estimate that the Senate Finance Committee’s version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” would increase long-run GDP by 1.1 percent and reduce federal tax revenue by $4.7 trillion from 2025-2034 on a conventional basis after incorporating JCT estimates for items not scored by Tax Foundation, updating our modeling of the SALT pass-through workarounds, and adding proposed changes to the premium tax credit, earned income tax credit and child tax credit into our distributional estimates.
- June 18, 2025: We estimate on a preliminary basis that the Senate Finance Committee’s version of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” would increase long-run GDP by 1.1 percent and reduce federal tax revenue by $4.8 trillion from 2025-2034 on a conventional basis.
- June 13, 2025: We updated our description of the bill’s changes to spending and revenue to better illustrate the share of revenue losses that are offset by dynamic revenue.
- June 6, 2025: We updated our analysis of the version of the “One Big Beautiful” bill that passed the House of Representatives. Our estimate of federal tax revenue losses fell back to $4.0 trillion from 2025 through 2034. Our estimate of the long-run GDP effect stayed at 0.8 percent.
- May 22, 2025: The “One Big Beautiful” bill was amended before being passed out of the House of Representatives. Tax policy changes include a more generous SALT deduction cap, changes to inflation indexingInflation indexing refers to automatic cost-of-living adjustments built into tax provisions to keep pace with inflation. Absent these adjustments, income taxes are subject to “bracket creep” and stealth increases on taxpayers, while excise taxes are vulnerable to erosion as taxes expressed in nominal dollars, rather than rates, slowly lose value. for the alternative minimum tax, accelerated phaseouts and adjustments for IRA green energy credits, a slight increase in the proposed international tax rates, and an expanded limit on itemized deductions, among other smaller changes. The long-run GDP effect increased slightly to 0.8 percent and federal tax revenue losses increased slightly to $4.1 trillion from 2025 through 2034 on a conventional basis.
- May 13, 2025: We estimate the House GOP’s “One Big Beautiful” tax bill under markup would increase long-run GDP by 0.6 percent and reduce federal tax revenue by $4.0 trillion from 2025 through 2034 on a conventional basis.
- May 5, 2025: We estimate the tariffs imposed as of May 2025 would raise $2.1 trillion of revenue from 2025 through 2034, while reducing US economic output by 0.8 percent in the long run.
- April 10, 2025, the House adopted the Senate’s amended version of the budget resolution, which allows $5.3 trillion in deficit-financed tax cuts (the combination of $3.8 trillion of tax cuts assumed to be “costless” under a current policy baseline plus $1.5 trillion in additional deficits permitted), deficit increases of $521 billion on defense and immigration spending, a minimum of $4 billion in spending cuts, and an increase in the debt limit of up to $5 trillion.
- April 2, 2025, the Senate introduced an updated budget resolution to provide new guidance to its committees on tax and spending policy changes. It adopts the instructions in the House resolution for the House committees while instructing the Senate Finance Committee to make tax policy changes that reduce revenue by up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years against a current policy baseline, which assumes an additional $3.8 trillion in tax cuts. While the $3.8 trillion would not officially score as a deficit increase against a current policy baseline, it effectively permits $5.3 trillion in deficit-financed tax cuts.
- The Senate resolution gives the Chair of the Senate Budget Committee the ability to revise the numbers using a current tax policy baseline and instructs the Senate Finance Committee to propose an increase in the debt limit by up to $5 trillion.
- The Senate resolution gives the Chair of the Senate Budget Committee the ability to revise the numbers using a current tax policy baseline and instructs the Senate Finance Committee to propose an increase in the debt limit by up to $5 trillion.
- February 25, 2025, the House passed a budget resolution to start the reconciliation process, specifying reductions in taxes and spending over the next decade relative to a current law baseline. The House budget resolution allows a $4.5 trillion increase in the deficit from tax cuts over the next decade so long as spending is cut by $1.7 trillion. If spending is not cut by $1.7 trillion, the cap on tax cuts will be reduced dollar-for-dollar; if spending is cut by more than $1.7 trillion, the cap on tax cuts will be increased by the same.
- February 21, 2025, the Senate approved its own budget resolution to start the reconciliation process, but it does not permit any tax cuts.

Details
- On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was signed into law by President Trump after it was passed out of the House on July 3rd and the Senate on July 1st.
- OBBBA notably includes permanence for major individual and corporate provisions of the TCJA along with additional temporary tax cuts for individuals and businesses
Analysis
- Our analysis finds the tax provisions included in OBBBA will increase long-run GDP by 1.2 percent, hours worked by 938,000 jobs, wages by 0.4 percent, and the capital stock by 0.7 percent.
- We estimate the OBBBA tax provisions will reduce federal tax revenue by $5.0 trillion from 2025-2034 on a conventional basis. On a dynamic basis, incorporating the projected increase in long-run GDP of 1.2 percent, the dynamic score of the tax provisions falls to $4.1 trillion, meaning economic growth pays for 19 percent of the tax cuts.
- By making key provisions like 100 percent bonus depreciationDepreciation is a measurement of the “useful life” of a business asset, such as machinery or a factory, to determine the multiyear period over which the cost of that asset can be deducted from taxable income. Instead of allowing businesses to deduct the cost of investments immediately (i.e., full expensing), depreciation requires deductions to be taken over time, reducing their value and disco and expensing for R&D permanent, OBBBA is a more pro-growth law than earlier proposed versions, improving stability, taxpayer certainty, and investment incentives.
- Combined with nearly $1.1 trillion in spending reductions, we estimate OBBBA will increase budget deficits by $3.0 trillion from 2025-2034 before added interest costs. Interest costs would add $725 billion to the 10-year deficit impact, bringing the total deficit increase on a dynamic basis to nearly $3.8 trillion inclusive of additional interest payments due to increased borrowing.
- The increased borrowing under OBBBA will reduce American incomes (GNP) by 0.6 percent, creating a wedge between the increase in long-run GDP of 1.2 percent and the increase in long-run GNP of 0.9 percent.

Details
- On May 22, the House Rules Committee amended elements of the House Ways and Means legislative text related to SALT, IRA green energy credits, international taxes, the alternative minimum tax, and itemization deductions. The broader bill was passed out of the House of Representatives.
- On May 12, the House Ways and Means CommitteeThe Committee on Ways and Means, more commonly referred to as the House Ways and Means Committee, is the chief tax-writing committee in the US. The House Ways and Means Committee has jurisdiction over all bills relating to taxes and other revenue generation, as well as spending programs like Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance, among others. released pre-mark legislative text to extend the expiring 2017 tax cuts and provide additional changes to the US tax system ahead of a markup hearing on May 13.
- The legislative text introduced by the Ways and Means Committee cuts taxes by less than the budget resolution instructions, implying either that spending reductions have fallen short of the target or that lawmakers are leaving room for further negotiations over certain tax items.
Analysis
- On July 3, the House agreed to the Senate amendment of the bill. The analysis below reflects the original House-passed version of the bill.
- Our preliminary analysis finds the tax provisions included in the House reconciliation bill would increase long-run GDP by 0.8 percent, increase hours worked by 983,000 jobs, increase American incomes as measured by GNP by 0.7 percent, increase wages by less than 0.05 percent, and increase the capital stock by 0.2 percent.
- We estimate the tax provisions would reduce federal tax revenue by $4.0 trillion between 2025 and 2034, on a conventional bases. On a dynamic basis, incorporating the projected increase in long-run GDP of 0.8 percent, the dynamic score of the tax provisions falls to $3.1 trillion, meaning economic growth pays for 22 percent of the tax cuts. The bill’s net spending cuts of about $1.5 trillion lead to a combined budget deficit increase of $1.7 trillion over the 10-year budget window on a dynamic basis.
- Overall, the bill would prevent tax increases on 62 percent of taxpayers that would occur if the TCJA expired as scheduled. However, by introducing narrowly targeted new provisions and sunsetting the most pro-growth provisions, like bonus depreciation and research and development (R&D) expensing, it leaves economic growth on the table and complicates the structure of the tax code.

Details
- On the campaign trail, and reiterated in his March 4 joint address to Congress, President Trump called for permanence for the 2017 tax law, restoring the state and local tax (SALT) deductionThe state and local tax (SALT) deduction permits taxpayers who itemize when filing federal taxes to deduct certain taxes paid to state and local governments. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) capped it at $10,000 per year, consisting of property taxes plus state income or sales taxes, but not both., reducing the corporate tax rate for domestic production, exempting various types of income from the income tax, repealing green energy tax credits, and imposing steep new tariffs.
Analysis
- Some of Trump’s tax proposals are well-designed and would be efficient ways to promote long-run economic growth, such as permanent expensing for machinery, equipment, and research and development (R&D).
- Some of his tax proposals are poorly designed and would worsen the structure of the tax code while only creating a muted impact on long-run economic growth, such as the exemptions for tips and Social Security income.
- Worse yet, Trump’s reliance on import tariffs to offset the cost of tax cuts come with major downsides. Tariffs are a particularly distortive way to raise revenue, especially as they invite foreign retaliation. We estimate Trump’s proposed tariffs and partial retaliation from all trading partners would together offset more than two-thirds of the long-run economic benefit of his proposed tax cuts.
- During the campaign, we estimated Trump’s tax proposals would increase long-run GDP by 0.8 percent, the capital stock by 1.7 percent, wages by 0.8 percent, and employment by 597,000 full-time equivalent jobs. We also estimated the proposals would increase the 10-year budget deficit by $3 trillion conventionally and $2.5 trillion dynamically.

Details
- President Trump has imposed new tariffs on nearly all US trading partners as well as on specific products, affecting more than 70 percent of US imports. While the tariffs are not formally or officially part of the reconciliation context, they will have economic and revenue effects to consider alongside the tax package Congress produces.
Analysis
- The tariffs imposed and scheduled to take effect as of April 2025 would increase federal tax revenue by $2.1 trillion from 2025 through 2034 on a conventional basis and decrease after-tax incomes by 1.2 percent on average.
- Before accounting for foreign retaliation, Tax Foundation estimates the tariffs will reduce long-run US output by 0.7 percent.

Trumps Tariffs: Topline Preliminary Estimates
Details
- Beginning January 1, 2026, most provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) will expire. Additionally, several business provisions have already expired or are phasing out. Without Congressional action, expiration of the individual provisions would increase taxes for 62 percent of taxpayers, while extension will significantly reduce federal revenues over the coming decade.
Analysis
- Over the 2025 through 2034 budget window, permanence for the expiring TCJA individual provisions will reduce federal tax revenue by $3.6 trillion ($3.2 trillion dynamically), the expiring estate tax provisions by $240 billion ($240 billion dynamically), and the expiring business provisions by $648 billion ($351 billion dynamically).
- Long-run GDP would be 1.1 percent higher, offsetting $710 billion, or 16 percent, of the revenue losses.
- The $4.5 trillion reduction in tax revenues would increase the budget deficit and push up interest costs by an estimated $941 billion ($806 billion dynamically). Long-run GNP would only rise by 0.4 percent, as some of the benefits of the tax cuts and larger economy go to foreigners in the form of higher interest payments on the debt.
- As a result of the tax cuts, after-tax incomes would rise by 2.9 percent (3.4 percent dynamically) in 2026 on average. The share of filers who itemize would drop from 33 percent to 13 percent, and 62 percent of filers would see a tax cut from extending the individual provisions.

What is Budget Reconciliation?
In 2017, Republicans used a procedure called budget reconciliation to pass the TCJA. Democrats used it for the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. Reconciliation is a fast-track option to enact tax, spending, and debt limit changes outlined in a budget resolution, notably bypassing a filibuster in the Senate that would otherwise require 60 votes to avoid. Budget reconciliation allows Republicans to rely on a party-line vote for legislation, but they still face slim majorities in both chambers.
Lawmakers can specify targets or limits on reductions or increases in the deficit within the budget window. The “Byrd rule” limits what can be included in a reconciliation bill, disallowing policy changes that don’t affect spending or revenue, and disallowing changes that increase the deficit outside of the budget window. Reconciliation also specifically prohibits changes to Social Security.
What is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act?
The 2017 Trump Tax Cuts, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), reduced average tax burdens for taxpayers across the income spectrum and temporarily simplified the tax filing process through structural reforms. It also boosted capital investment by reforming the corporate tax system and significantly improved the international tax system.
At the end of 2025, the individual portions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expire all at once. Without congressional action, 62 percent of filers could soon face a tax increase relative to current policy in 2026. At the same time, the price tag for extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts is in the trillions.

The Path Forward: Principled, Pro-Growth, Fiscally Responsible Tax Reform
Congress is staring down the expiration of the TCJA, and the Tax Foundation is prepared to provide insight and analysis on the policies at stake. Since its enactment in 2017, the Tax Foundation team has studied the TCJA’s underlying construction and resulting strengths and weaknesses. We have also analyzed fundamental reforms that would dramatically improve the US tax system to support economic growth as well as greater efficiency and simplicity.
Whether lawmakers target fundamental tax reform or follow the outline of the TCJA, they will confront decisions on what to prioritize in this forthcoming round of tax reform. In that regard, staying within the overall TCJA construct, the Tax Foundation team has analyzed difficult, but revenue-neutral ways to build a pro-growth set of reform options that would not significantly worsen the deficit once changes to the economy are considered or substantially change the distribution of the tax burden across the income scale.
