Tracking the Trump Administration’s Harmful Executive Actions
The Trump Administration has acted illegally and unconstitutionally in ways that weaken our democratic institutions, slow down our economy, roll back protections for public health and the environment, and put health care and Social Security benefits at risk for millions of Americans. And that’s just the start.
I am committed to fighting back against these abuses of power and keeping you informed. House Democrats are engaged in a multifaceted struggle to protect and defend everyday Americans from the harm being inflicted by this administration. It is an all-hands-on deck effort simultaneously underway in Congress, the Courts and the Community. In connection with that effort, I have joined the House Democrats’ Rapid Response Task Force and Litigation Working Group.

Deportation and Detention of Student Protesters and Foreign Scholars
- Date: March–May 2025
Action: In 2025, the Trump administration expanded its use of immigration enforcement to target foreign nationals, particularly students, researchers, and legal residents—some for accused of engaging in, or merely being adjacent to pro-Palestinian activism, some without any explanation at all. While the administration cites national security and antisemitism concerns, many of those detained or threatened with deportation have not been accused of any criminal behavior. The crackdown appears designed to chill speech and dissent on college campuses.
Key examples include:
- Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident and Columbia University student, was arrested in March without access to counsel and sent to a detention center in El Paso.
- Yunseo Chung, a Columbia undergraduate and green card holder, was targeted by ICE using a pretextual arrest warrant; a federal judge later stayed her deportation.
- Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish Fulbright scholar at Tufts, was detained after co-authoring a student editorial; she was released on bond after a media outcry.
- Kseniia Petrova, a Russian biomedical researcher at Harvard Medical School, was detained by ICE despite no involvement in protests. Her colleagues say she was targeted solely due to her visa status and association with student groups under investigation.
- On April 29, 2025, Rep. Cohen led a letter to Secretary Kirsti Noem and the acting director of the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) seeking the release of Kseniia Petrova. Click here to read more.
- Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian national at Columbia, had her visa revoked and chose to self-deport to avoid further legal jeopardy. She was not alleged to have broken any laws.
In addition to arrests and detentions, the Department of Homeland Security abruptly suspended student visa records at universities across the country—including the University of Memphis, Christian Brothers University, and Rhodes College—leaving international students in Memphis without valid immigration status or explanation. These terminations occurred with no notice, no due process, and no clear justification. Many affected students were not even involved in campus protests.
Status: Following a wave of public outcry, legal action, and pressure from Democratic lawmakers the Trump administration reversed courseand reinstated student visa records for affected individuals. Still, other deportations and detentions remain active, and ICE continues to defend the authority behind the crackdown. Civil rights groups have filed multiple lawsuits arguing that the administration’s actions violate the First Amendment, due process protections, and federal immigration law. Legal experts have drawn comparisons to the Alien Enemies Act of 1798—a wartime law now being used in peacetime to suppress dissent.
Congressman Cohen strongly condemned these actions, calling them a direct attack on constitutional rights. After learning of visa suspensions in Memphis, Cohen sent a formal letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem demanding a reversal and accountability. The administration’s reversal came days later.
Executive Actions Targeting Colleges and Universities
- Date: April—May 2025
- Action: In the spring of 2025, President Donald Trump launched a campaign of executive actions and public threats aimed at elite academic institutions—including Harvard, Columbia, and the University of Pennsylvania—accusing them of harboring antisemitism and promoting "anti-American" values. These actions include:
- Executive Order on Campus Accountability (April 11, 2025): Directs the Department of Education to withhold federal funding from colleges and universities deemed “hostile environments” under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, based on complaints of antisemitism.
- DOJ Investigations and IRS Threats: The Trump administration has ordered civil rights investigations of multiple campuses and threatened to review their tax-exempt status. Columbia University was briefly placed on a federal “watchlist” before a federal judge issued a temporary injunction blocking any punitive action.
- Public Smear Campaigns: Trump and senior administration officials have repeatedly attacked university leaders on social media and at campaign rallies, labeling students and faculty as “terrorist sympathizers” and calling for mass firings.
- Status: These actions have faced pushback from civil liberties and academic freedom advocates. In May 2025, Harvard University formally responded to the Department of Education’s inquiries, rejecting accusations of institutional antisemitism and defending its disciplinary process as fair and consistent. A federal judge in New York ruled that the administration's attempt to strip funding from Harvard lacked sufficient evidence and violated due process protections.
Several lawsuits are underway, including one filed by Columbia alleging that the administration’s actions amount to unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination.
Congressman Cohen has condemned the Trump administration’s attacks as a dangerous assault on academic freedom and free expression. He praised Harvard’s legal response and reaffirmed his support for universities' rights to govern themselves without political interference. Cohen is working with colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to investigate potential abuses of executive power in the administration’s campaign against American higher education institutions.
Executive Orders Targeting Law Firms
- Date: March 2025
- Action: In March 2025, President Donald Trump issued a series of executive orders aimed at prominent law firms, alleging unethical conduct and imposing severe sanctions. These actions included revoking security clearances, terminating government contracts, and restricting access to federal buildings. Notably affected firms include:
- Perkins Coie LLP:On March 6, 2025, an executive order barred federal agencies from utilizing Perkins Coie's services, suspended the security clearances of its attorneys, and prohibited its lawyers from entering federal buildings.The administration accused the firm of "dishonest and dangerous activity" and "racial discrimination" related to its diversity initiatives.
- Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison:Targeted on March 14, 2025, this firm faced similar retaliatory sanctions due to its pro bono work and associations with individuals involved in investigations against President Trump.The executive order was rescinded after the firm agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services aligned with the administration's agenda and to discontinue its diversity policies.
- WilmerHale:On March 27, 2025, an executive order suspended WilmerHale's security clearances, restricted access to federal buildings, and terminated government contracts.The firm was targeted due to its association with former special counsel Robert Mueller, who led the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
- Status:These executive orders have sparked significant legal challenges and widespread condemnation from the legal community.Perkins Coie filed a lawsuit resulting in a temporary restraining order blocking most provisions of the executive order against it.Judge Beryl Howell noted that the order "casts a chilling harm of blizzard proportion across the entire legal profession."Other firms, such as Jenner & Block, have also initiated legal action, arguing that the administration's actions violate the First Amendment and constitute an abuse of power intended to deter legal opposition.
Congressman Cohen strongly opposes these executive orders, viewing them as direct assaults on the independence of the legal profession and the foundational principles of the rule of law.He is collaborating with colleagues to introduce legislation aimed at safeguarding legal practitioners from politically motivated sanctions and is closely monitoring ongoing legal proceedings to support efforts that uphold constitutional rights and democratic institutions.
Stripping Power from Independent Regulatory Agencies
- Date: February 18, 2025
- Action: President Trump signed an executive order titled Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies, requiring independent regulatory agencies—including the Federal Election Commission (FEC), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Federal Trade Commission (FTC)—to submit their major regulations to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. The order also mandates that these independent agencies set up new “White House Liaison offices” and coordinate legal positions with the President or Attorney General.
These independent agencies were created by Congress to serve the public interest free from political interference. They are led by experts in their fields and are not meant to be subject to the political whims of any administration. Trump’s executive order is widely viewed as an illegal power grab that seeks to erode their independence and bend them to his will. - Status: On February 28, 2025, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), along with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging President Trump's Executive Order 14215, titled "Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies." The plaintiffs argue that the order unlawfully extends presidential control over independent agencies, particularly the Federal Election Commission (FEC), thereby undermining their mandated independence.
Legal experts anticipate that the courts will scrutinize the constitutionality of the executive order, especially regarding its impact on the autonomy of independent regulatory agencies. As of March 11, 2025, the case is pending, and no court rulings have been issued yet.
Congressman Cohen continues to oppose this executive order and is exploring legislative measures to reinforce the independence of regulatory agencies. He is also closely monitoring the ongoing legal proceedings and is prepared to support actions that uphold the checks and balances integral to democratic governance.
DOGE Access to Government Payment Systems
- Date: January 31, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration granted Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to sensitive payment and data systems, including those managed by the Treasury Department, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
- Status: Congressman Cohen, Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL), and more than 150 House Democrats demanded answers from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Musk’s access to government data and payment systems.
Congressman Cohen was among the first cosponsors of the Taxpayer Data Protection Act, a bill to lock Elon Musk and DOGE out of America’s most sensitive data systems.
On Friday, March 7, a federal judge in Washington, DC refused to block DOGE employees from accessing Treasury payment systems containing Americans’ sensitive personal data. However, DOGE’s access to the Treasury’s payment systems remains blocked under an injunction issued by the Manhattan federal district court in February.
Executive Order Freezing Federal Grant Funding
- Date: January 27, 2025
- Action: Trump issued an executive order halting nearly all federal grants, including those funding public health, education, small businesses, and infrastructure projects. This caused deep disruptions across nearly every sector of the economy—temporarily stalling funding for everything from infrastructure projects to lifesaving medical research at St. Jude, UTHSC, and other institutions, and more.
- Status: On February 3, this was blocked by a federal judge, who ruled that Trump lacked authority to withhold congressionally appropriated funds. While some payments have resumed, delays persist for many programs. Lawsuits were filed by a coalition of 22 state attorneys general, the ACLU, and multiple advocacy groups. Legal challenges remain ongoing.
Congressman Cohen joined his Transportation and Infrastructure Committee colleagues in sending a letter to DOT Secretary Duffy in response to President Trump’s executive orders halting the funding of important infrastructure investments.
Executive Order Ending Birthright Citizenship
- Date: January 20, 2025
- Action: Trump issued an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens, a direct violation of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
- Status: On February 13, 2025, a federal judge, U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston, issued a nationwide preliminary injunction blocking President Trump's executive order that sought to end birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens. Judge Sorokin ruled that the order is likely unconstitutional, emphasizing that the 14th Amendment broadly confers birthright citizenship. He is the fourth federal judge to rule against this unconstitutional executive order.
As of March 11, 2025, the executive order remains unenforceable due to these injunctions, and legal challenges are ongoing.
Closure of USAID
- Date: February 3, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration empowered DOGE to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a key institution in foreign aid, including HIV/AIDS prevention programs. The move aimed to significantly reduce the U.S. government’s role in international development, halting critical humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and global health initiatives. The decision was met with widespread bipartisan opposition, citing risks to national security and global stability. Many USAID workers are essentially stranded, with no plans from our government to help them travel back to the United States.
- Status: Congressman Cohen sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressing concern about the impact that shuttering USAID would have on programs that help women and girls worldwide. He also wrote to Secretary Rubio urging that global HIV and AIDS services continue uninterrupted.
A federal judge ruled that Trump exceeded his constitutional authority by freezing almost all U.S. humanitarian and development spending abroad but did not order the restoration of the terminated contracts.
On March 10, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration had completed a six-week purge of USAID programs, eliminating 83% of them and moving the remaining 17% under the State Department. Legal challenges from international aid organizations, advocacy groups, and former USAID officials are ongoing.
Federal Workers
Threatening Emails to Federal Workers
- Date: January 28, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration sent mass emails encouraging federal workers to resign, with thinly veiled threats of termination. These emails, sent to approximately two million federal employees, warned of impending job cuts and reductions in benefits, creating a climate of fear and uncertainty. Unions and civil service protections groups condemned the move as an intimidation tactic designed to weaken the federal workforce and dismantle career civil service positions.
- Status: As of February 12, 2025, approximately 77,000 federal employees—about 3.2% of the workforce—accepted the administration's buyout offer, falling short of the 5-10% target. Legal challenges to the program are ongoing. Legal proceedings remain ongoing.

Termination of Probationary Employees
- Date: February 13, 2025
- Action: The Office of Personnel Management and Acting Director Charles Ezell ordered federal agencies to terminate tens of thousands of probationary employees en masse. Probationary employees are members of the competitive service in their first year of employment or of the excepted service in their first two years of employment, and may also include long-time federal workers who have recently been employed in a new position or a new agency.
- Status: On February 28, 2025, a judge ordered that OPM’s memos directing the termination of probationary workers were “unlawful, invalid, and must be stopped and rescinded,” and that OPM must provide written notice of the order to the six agencies.
Congressman Cohen sent a letter to OPM condemning the Trump administration’s illegal mass termination of probationary federal employees. He also cosponsored the Protect our Probationary Employees Act, which would strengthen protections for probationary federal workers who were recently fired by the Trump administration.
Public Health
Rollback of Healthcare Regulations
- Date: January 25, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration issued executive actions rolling back key patient protections under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). These rollbacks eliminate essential health benefits requirements, allowing insurers to once again deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions and impose lifetime coverage limits. The move also defunded ACA outreach programs that help Americans enroll in affordable health plans, threatening access to care for millions.
- Status: Legal challenges are ongoing. Several state attorneys general, along with healthcare advocacy groups, have filed lawsuits arguing that these actions violate federal law and endanger public health. A preliminary injunction request is under review in multiple courts.
On March 10, 2025, the Trump administration announced further rollbacks, including cuts to ACA enrollment periods and navigator funding. Some states have filed lawsuits to block these changes.
Rollback of Affordable Drug and Insulin Pricing Policies
- Date: January 20, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration rescinded Executive Order 14087, which was designed to lower prescription drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid recipients. The rollback eliminated a $2 copayment cap on generic medications for Medicare beneficiaries and terminated a pilot program that helped state Medicaid programs afford expensive but life-saving cell and gene therapies. The order also removed Biden-era policies that allowed Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for treatments granted accelerated FDA approval.
- Status: Healthcare advocacy groups and a coalition of state attorneys general have filed lawsuits challenging the rollback, arguing that it unlawfully strips low-income Americans of affordable treatment options. Some states are exploring independent efforts to maintain lower drug costs, but federal support has been withdrawn. Legal challenges remain ongoing.
Executive Order Removing U.S. from WHO
- Date: January 20, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration announced the withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO), cutting off U.S. funding for global health initiatives, including pandemic preparedness, vaccine distribution, and disease eradication programs. The decision immediately jeopardized global efforts to combat infectious diseases and undermined international health cooperation. Public health experts and bipartisan lawmakers warned that this move could leave the U.S. vulnerable in future health crises.
- Status: WHO requires a one-year notice before a country can finalize the termination of its membership. Senate Democrats are considering potential legislative action to block the withdrawal and restore funding. Multiple public health organizations and advocacy groups have filed lawsuits challenging the legality of the withdrawal, arguing that it violates congressional mandates on global health commitments.
On January 31, 2025, Congressman Cohen sent a letter, co-signed by 42 Members of Congress, to President Trump asking him to reconsider his decision to withdraw from WHO.
Reducing Administrative Support for NIH Grants
- Date: February 7, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration announced that it will reduce funds that support grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for indirect expenses. Tennessee institutions like St Jude, the University of Tennessee Health Science Center receive $770 million from NIH for medical research grants each year, leading to $1.99 billion in economic activity in our state. The grants include funds for the people conducting the research (direct costs) and also anything that is needed to support the researcher, such as construction, utility costs, safety and security, and the team that supports the researchers (indirect costs). The Trump Administration is limiting indirect expenses to 15% of the grant, a move that would cause layoffs, suspend clinical trials, and delay progress on groundbreaking research.
- Status: On February 10, Congressman Cohen released a statement stating that the short-sighted and dangerous policy should be reversed immediately. He also signed onto a letter, co-signed by more than 90 of his colleagues in the House of Representatives, to the NIH Acting Director expressing alarm over the decision and requesting information about any downstream impacts NIH considered prior to its announcement.
On March 5, 2025, a federal judge in Massachusetts issued a nationwide preliminary injunction blocking the Trump Administration's proposed 15% cap on indirect cost reimbursements for NIH grants. This decision prevents the implementation of the cap, ensuring that for now research institutions will continue to receive necessary funding to support facilities and administrative expenses associated with NIH-funded research.
Education
Executive Order to Dismantle the Department of Education
- Date: March 20, 2025
- Action: President Trump signed an executive order directing the closure of the U.S. Department of Education. The order instructs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take all necessary steps to dismantle the department and "return authority to state and local communities". While the order states that the federal government will maintain essential functions such as Title I funding for low-income schools, Pell Grants, and support for students with disabilities, it will exacerbate educational inequalities and disrupt the administration of vital programs. Concerns have been raised about the future management of the federal student loan portfolio, valued at approximately $1.6 trillion, and the enforcement of civil rights protections in education.
- Status: The executive order has sparked significant legal and political opposition. A coalition of organizations, including the National Education Association and the NAACP, has filed lawsuits challenging the order, arguing that the dissolution of the Department of Education violates federal statutes and undermines protections for vulnerable student populations. Additionally, since the department was established by Congress, its complete closure would require legislative approval, making the future of this initiative uncertain.
Congressman Cohen strongly opposes this executive order and is actively working with colleagues to introduce legislation aimed at preserving the Department of Education. - Resources: Students, parents, and educators seeking information on how this executive order may affect federal education programs can visit studentaid.gov for updates on student loans and grants.
Cuts to Pell Grants and Federal Student Loan Programs
- Date: February 5, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration has significantly reduced funding for Pell Grants and other federal student aid programs, making it harder for low-income students to afford higher education. The Department of Education has also introduced new restrictions on federal student loans, capping borrowing limits and tightening eligibility for income-driven repayment plans. These cuts have forced many students to take on more private debt or reconsider their ability to attend college.
- Status: Education advocacy groups have filed lawsuits, arguing that these changes violate federal education funding statutes and disproportionately harm low-income students. While some states are exploring ways to supplement lost funding, federal support remains uncertain, leaving current students and families in limbo.
- Resources: Impacted students should visit studentaid.gov for more information on their loan status and to stay updated on policy changes. For more, click here to visit my resource page.
Rollback of PSLF and Student Loan Relief Programs
- Date: February 5, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration has moved to dismantle key student loan relief programs, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and expanded income-driven repayment plans. Borrowers who were on track for forgiveness under PSLF now face uncertainty as the administration seeks to limit eligibility and cancel previously approved relief. Efforts to provide broader student debt cancellation, including relief for borrowers defrauded by for-profit colleges, have also been halted.
- Status: Multiple lawsuits have been filed by borrowers, advocacy organizations, and state attorneys general, arguing that the rollback violates existing legal protections and disproportionately affects middle- and lower-income Americans. While legal challenges play out, millions of borrowers are left with higher repayment burdens and fewer options for relief.
- Resources: Impacted borrowers should visit studentaid.gov/pslf for more information on their eligibility, application status, and updates on policy changes affecting the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. For more, click here to visit my resource page.
Attacks on the Department of Education and Locking Lawmakers Out
- Date: February 7, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration is ramping up its efforts to dismantle the Department of Education, pushing an agenda to gut federal education funding and strip away student protections. Reports indicate the administration is preparing an executive order to shut down the department entirely, handing control over to states—many of which have already slashed public school budgets and rolled back civil rights protections.
Adding to the chaos, congressional lawmakers were locked out of the Department of Educationwhen they attempted to meet with agency officials to demand answers. Trump’s team is not only gutting critical student aid programs but actively blocking elected representatives from doing their jobs and holding them accountable. - Status: The administration's radical push to eliminate the Department of Education has drawn fierce backlash. Legal experts have pointed out that abolishing a federal agency requires congressional approval, making this another reckless political stunt. Meanwhile, shutting lawmakers out of a federal agency is unprecedented and raises serious questions about transparency and accountability.
House Democrats are calling for immediate oversight hearings and demanding the administration reverse course before millions of students and borrowers suffer the consequences. The fight to protect public education is far from over—but make no mistake, Trump and his allies want to tear it down brick by brick.
Congressman Cohen has cosponsored the Department of Education Protection Act, which prohibits the use of appropriated funds to be used to decentralize, reduces the staffing level of, or alters the responsibilities, structure, authority, or functionality of the Department of Education.
Environmental Protections
Rollback of EPA Regulations
- Date: February 4, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration issued sweeping rollbacks to environmental protections, weakening regulations on air and water quality, allowing increased industrial pollution, and reversing emissions standards for power plants and vehicles. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was ordered to halt enforcement of climate-related policies, and several clean energy funding programs were defunded. These changes sparked widespread concern among environmental organizations, health experts, and state governments.
- Status: Executive order in effect. Lawsuits have been filed by multiple states, environmental advocacy groups, and public health organizations. A federal court has scheduled hearings on an emergency injunction request, but the policy changes remain in effect for now. Legal challenges remain ongoing.
Withdrawal from Paris Climate Accords
- Date: January 22, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration formally withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, reversing years of progress on global climate commitments.
- Status: The executive order remains in effect. Senate Democrats are pushing legislative measures to rejoin the agreement, while multiple states and environmental groups have filed lawsuits challenging the legality of the withdrawal. Several states, including California and New York, have announced independent commitments to meet Paris Agreement goals despite the federal withdrawal.
Cuts to Clean Energy and Sustainability Programs
- Date: February 2, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration slashed funding for federal clean energy and sustainability programs, including initiatives aimed at expanding renewable energy infrastructure, improving energy efficiency, and reducing carbon emissions. Programs supporting wind and solar development, climate resilience projects, and electric vehicle infrastructure were among those defunded, putting thousands of clean energy jobs at risk.
- Status: Lawsuits challenging the budget cuts have been filed by multiple states, clean energy organizations, and environmental advocacy groups, arguing that these reductions violate federal mandates on climate policy. A federal court has yet to rule on an emergency injunction request.
Congressman Cohen sent a letter DOT Secretary Duffy in response to DOT's suspension of state electric vehicle infrastructure deployment plans and rescission of guidance used for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program.
Small Businesses
Cuts to Small Business Grants, Including Black- and Women-Owned Businesses
- Date: February 1, 2025
- Action: The Trump Administration halted funding for federal small business grants, disproportionately impacting minority- and women-owned businesses that rely on these programs for startup capital, expansion, and stability. The cuts have particularly targeted initiatives aimed at fostering economic growth in historically underserved communities. The administration has also moved to eliminate funding tied to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.
- Status: As of March 11, 2025, the Trump Administration's funding freeze on federal small business grants, including those supporting minority- and women-owned businesses, remains blocked by federal court orders. Multiple lawsuits have been filed by higher education and civil rights advocacy groups, arguing that the cuts violate federal economic equity mandates.
