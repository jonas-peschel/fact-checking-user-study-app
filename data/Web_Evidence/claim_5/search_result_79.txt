Common Law LLB
Note that the Common Law LLB is not accredited by the Law Society of Scotland and is therefore not suitable for any applicant who wishes to have the option of practising law in Scotland.
Applicants should apply for either the Common Law LLB or the Scots Law LLB, not both. We will only make an offer of a place on one LLB degree. Students wishing to practise law in Scotland (or Scotland and elsewhere) are expected to apply for the Scots Law LLB. Once admitted, transfer between programmes is not permitted by the College of Social Science regulations.
The Common Law degree is designed for those who plan to practise law in common law jurisdictions such as England & Wales, Northern Ireland, Ireland, and Canada. It is not suitable if you wish to enter the legal profession in Scotland. The Common Law curriculum offers intellectual depth and has a range of flexible options.
For 2024, Law at Glasgow is ranked 3rd in the UK (The Times & Sunday Times Good University Guide), 6th in the UK (Guardian University Guide) and 7th in the UK (Complete University Guide).

Law at Glasgow
Which law degree is right for me?
The School of Law offers:
- Scots Law LLB: If you intend to practice in Scotland as a solicitor or advocate you should apply for the Scots Law LLB.
- Common Law LLB: If you intend to practice law in a Common Law jurisdiction such as England & Wales, Northern Ireland, Canada, or India you should apply for the Common Law LLB.
Why study Law?
Law is a subject that is relevant to everyone because it affects all our daily lives. It is an academic discipline that attracts students who are interested in how society is regulated, what the aims of regulation should be and how successful it is in achieving them.
The University of Glasgow prides itself on developing world changers and a knowledge and understanding of law and legal systems is one of the important ways in which people can seek to make a difference. This might be through changes to legal policy or practice, or in helping people to solve everyday problems or avoid future disputes.
What kinds of skills do I need to study law?
You will need to be prepared to read a lot of material. Studying law involves reading cases, legislation, official reports and academic opinion about them. This will require you to be able to find relevant information quickly, to pick out what is important and to remember it.
Studying law is not, however, just about gathering information. It is also about analysing facts and putting them into context to be able to provide a reasoned argument about what the law is on a matter. Solving a legal problem requires close attention to detail, an excellent grasp of legal principles and appropriate legal authority, clarity of thought and the ability to think logically and communicate effectively.
Throughout our law degrees you will develop skills in research, managing information, writing, oral presentation, providing critical analysis of law and legal policy, problem solving and working independently and with others.
What kinds of opportunities does the Law School offer?
As well as benefiting from excellent teaching, our law students are able to take advantage of many other opportunities to widen their skills and experiences.These include study abroad for the whole or part of third year. We have strong links with employers and offer a number of events involving law firms and other organisations who are invited to provide information and advice. It is also possible to take part in voluntary placement schemes in the community such as in the Citizens Advice Bureau and Law Centres. We have a very long and successful tradition of competitive mooting (presenting arguments in mock trials), nationally and internationally.
About the Law School
The Law School is located in the Stair Building on the main University Campus on University Avenue, where you will find academic and administrative staff. Some classes are held here, although a wide range of teaching rooms is used across the campus. The Stair Building also houses the Sir Alexander Stone Court Room (which is used for mooting) and the Law Workshop (a study space and an additional library resource to the main library).
Programme structure
The Bachelor of Laws (LLB) Common Law programme is an exacting intellectual discipline and offers a thorough grounding in key areas of the law. The degree can be studied to Ordinary level, requiring three years of full-time study, or to Honours level in four years of full-time study.
Year 1
Initially you will study the following core modules:
- Common law system & method
- Constitutional law
- Law of tort
- Criminal law of England & Wales
- Law of contract.
Year 2
In the following year, you will study core modules in:
- Equity & trusts
- European Union law

Law with Languages
There are many opportunities for you to study law with languages. Language study is an integrated part of the degree, with your language skills carefully developed during your first two years of study. This assists to prepare you for year 3, where you will study law in a partner university abroad, where teaching and learning take place in your chosen language (French, German, Italian or Spanish).
Two-year Common law LLB (Accelerated)
The Common Law LLB two-year Ordinary degree is designed for graduates who plan to practise law in a jurisdiction beyond Scotland. The Accelerated LLB allows graduates in other disciplines to obtain a Common Law Ordinary degree in two years rather than four years.
Joint degree/Law with Languages/and Accelerated students will cover some of the core modules at different stages of their degrees. There may be in some limited cases timetable clashes. We nevertheless endeavour, where we can, to avoid these or if possible, provide alternatives.

Programme alteration or discontinuation
The University of Glasgow endeavours to run all programmes as advertised. In exceptional
circumstances, however, the University may withdraw or alter a programme. For more information,
please see: Student contract.
Our international links
We have an extremely successful and popular study abroad programme. Traditionally, more than 60% of our Honours students in a normal year take the opportunity to spend all or part of the third year studying law in another country. Many others participate in a summer school or other academic activity abroad.
These exchange and short-term mobility options are available through our Law with Languages or Legal Studies programmes or at English-speaking institutions across Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. Students may also take part in summer schools or other short-term mobility opportunities such as the Comparative Law Project.
In all cases study abroad is integrated into the degree and does not involve an additional year of study.

Visa requirements and proof of English language level
It is a visa requirement to provide information on your level of English based on an internationally recognised and secure English language test. All test reports must be no more than 2 years old. A list of these can be found on the UK Border Agency website. If you have never taken one of these tests before, you can get an initial idea of your level by using the Common European Framework self-assessment grid which gives you a level for each skill (e.g. listening B1/writing B2 etc.) However, please note that this is not a secure English language test and it is not sufficient evidence of your level of English for visa requirements.

Career prospects
The flexibility of the LLB (Common Law) at Glasgow, together with the emphasis on developing the key skills required by employers and the opportunities available to study abroad and to take part in placement opportunities, means that the degree provides a sound general foundation for a range of careers. These include the Civil Service, local government, journalism, industry & commerce, international institutions, administration, banking, insurance, social work and the police service.
All Glasgow law students benefit from a dedicated employability programme, featuring tailored events focusing on various aspects of legal practice. These events feature a range of legal professionals from solicitors and barristers through to judges (many of whom are Glasgow graduates themselves). Law students at Glasgow may also gain real-world legal experience and an opportunity to develop their skillset through legal clinical projects run via the GO Justice Initiative.
For those seeking to work as a lawyer in England & Wales, Ireland or Northern Ireland, the LLB (Common law) will provide an invaluable foundation in the academic study of law.
If you intend to become a barrister in England & Wales, the LLB (Common Law) satisfies the Bar Standards Board requirements regarding the academic component of training based on a law degree. After completing our degree, you would then undertake the ‘vocational stage’ of training, which requires completion of a postgraduate Bar course. The final step in qualifying as a barrister involves a period of full-time training for one year (‘pupillage’).
If you intend to become a solicitor, the LLB (Common Law) is currently recognised for the purposes of qualifying as a solicitor in Northern Ireland (the Solicitor course at the Institute of Professional Legal Studies, Belfast).
If you intend to become a solicitor in England and Wales, the Solicitors Regulation Authority administers an independent, centralised assessment called the Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE). This includes:
- A degree in any subject or a qualification or experience that is equivalent to a degree, such as a solicitor apprenticeship.
- Passing the SQE1 and SQE2 assessments.
- Two years’ full time (or equivalent) qualifying work experience.
- Passing character and suitability requirements.
The LLB (Common Law) is also a recognised degree in Northern Ireland and is foundational for those seeking entry to the legal profession in a range of other jurisdictions such as Canada.
To qualify for legal practice, you must pass additional examinations in the appropriate legal system before proceeding to professional training and qualification. These requirements will vary according to the intended jurisdiction for professional practice.

How to apply
Applicants should apply for either the Common Law LLB or the Scots Law LLB, not both, since we will only make an offer of a place on one LLB degree. Students wishing to practise law in Scotland (or Scotland and elsewhere) are expected to apply for the Scots Law LLB. Once admitted, transfer between programmes is not permitted by the College of Social Science regulations.
With the exception of applicants to the LLB (Accelerated), applicants to all LLB degrees who do not already hold an undergraduate degree are required to take the Law National Admissions test (LNAT)5.
The LNAT results of students will be taken into account in deciding whether to make offers of places on the Common Law LLB along with the entry requirements.
The LNAT is run by a consortium of UK universities and comprises an on-screen test (95 minutes) and essay questions (40 minutes). It is designed to assess verbal reasoning skills and command of written English. The test can be taken by applicants at centres throughout the UK and overseas.
For information on how and when to sit the test, together with practice papers, see lnat.ac.uk.
Full-time students must apply through the Universities & Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS).
SQA applicants who are eligible for our Widening Participation programmes are encouraged to participate in one or more of these programmes, including Summer School, to support your application and the transition to higher education.
International students to Arts, Engineering, Law, Nursing, Science, and Social Sciences can also apply using The Common Application: however, if applying to more than one UK university, we recommend using UCAS. Applications to Dentistry, Education, Medicine, and Veterinary Medicine must be made through UCAS.
Application deadlines
- 15 October: if including Dentistry, Medicine, Veterinary Medicine or also applying to Oxford or Cambridge
- 14 January: all other UK applicants (unless otherwise stated on the UCAS website)
