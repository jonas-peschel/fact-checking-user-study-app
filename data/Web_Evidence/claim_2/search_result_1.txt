The amount standing to the credit of the Federation Account, less the sum equivalent to 13 per cent of the revenue accruing to the Federation Account directly from any natural resources as a first line charge for distribution to the beneficiaries of the derivation funds in accordance with the Constitution shall, be distributed among the Federal and State Governments and the Local Government Councils in each State of the Federation on the

(1) The 56.00 per cent specified in section 1 (a) of this Act shall be allocated to the Federal Government and utilised as follows-
- Federal Government 48.50 per cent;
- General Ecological Problems 2.00 per cent;
- Federal Capital Territory 1.00 per cent;
- Development of Natural Resources 3.00 per cent.
[1992 No.106. S.I. 9 of 2002.]
(2) The 24.00 per cent standing to the credit of all the States in the Federation Account as specified in section 1 (b) of this Act shall be distributed among the States of the Federation using the factors specified in this Act.
[S.1. 9 of 2002.]
(3) For the purpose of subsection-
(a) Land mass of a State or local government shall be the proportional areal size (PAS) of the State or the local government to the total areal size of Nigeria, and shall be obtained as follows-
(i) for each State -
(PAS)= Areal size of State x 100
Total areal size of Nigeria
(ii) for each Local Government-
(PAS) = Areal size of Local Government Area x 100
Total areal size of Nigeria
(b) The allocation due to terrain is made on the basis of the proportional areal size of the three identified major terrain types present in the State or Local Government area respectively, which are-
(i) wetlands / waterbodies;
(ii) plains; and
(iii) highlands;
(c)
(i) education as a parameter for allocation to Social Development Factor (SDF) shall be measured in terms of primary school enrolment which attracts 60 per cent of the allocation to education while the remaining
40 per cent is made using secondary/commercial school enrolment; and allocation on the basis of primary school enrolment is made solely on direct proportion. 50 per cent of the allocation on the basis of secondary/commercial school enrolment is made in direct proportion while the remaining 50 per cent is made in inverse proportion. School enrolment refers to public funded schools only;
(ii) health as a parameter for allocation to social development factor shall be measured in terms of the number of State/Local Government hospital beds there are and 50 per cent of the allocation to health shall be made in direct proportion to the number of the State hospital beds, while the remaining 50 per cent shall be made in inverse proportion;
(iii) water as a parameter for allocation to social development factor shall be represented by mean annual rainfall in the State headquarters and territorial spread of State: 50 per cent of the allocation to water shall be made in direct proportion to the State's territorial spread, while the remaining 50 per cent shall be made in inverse proportion to the mean annual rainfall in each State headquarters, using the most current live year figures, the same year for all the States.
[1992 No.106.]
(4) For the avoidance of doubt, a sum equivalent to the difference between the amount standing to the credit of the Federation Account in anyone year, less the aggregate of the sums specified in section 1 of this Act shall revert to the Federation Account to be allocated and distributed in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

4. Proportion of revenue to be paid by each State to State Joint Local Government Account
(1) In addition to the allocation made from the Federation Account under section 1 of this Act to Local Government Councils, there shall be paid by each State in the Federation to the State Joint Local Government Account (as specified in subsection (5) of section 162 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria) in each quarter of the financial year, a sum representing 10 per cent of the internally-generated revenue for that quarter of the State concerned.

and the fund shall be distributed among the areas on the basis of need, subject to section 7 of the Niger Delta Development Commission (Establishment, etc.) Act.
[Cap. N86.]
(3) For the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, and for the avoidance of any doubt, the distinction hitherto made between on-shore and off-shore oil mineral revenue for the purpose of revenue sharing and the administration of the Fund for the development of the oil mineral producing areas, is hereby abolished.

(5) An amount equivalent to 0.5 per cent of the Federation Account shall be allocated and paid into a fund to be designated "Stabilisation Fund", which shall be administered by the Minister for Finance; the residue arising out of using mineral revenue, instead of the Federation Account as the base for allocation to the Fund for the development of the mineral producing areas shall be added to this Fund.
(6) An amount equivalent to 1 per cent of the Federation Account derived from mineral revenue shall be shared among the mineral producing States based on the amount of mineral produced from each State and in the application of this provision, the dichotomy of on-shore and off-shore oil production and mineral oil and non-mineral oil revenue is hereby abolished.
(7) For the purpose of this Act, and for the avoidance of any doubt, where any State of the Federation suffers absolute decline in its revenue arising from factors outside its control, as a result of the implementation of this Act, the Stabilisation Fund shall be used to initially augment the allocation to that State, in accordance with acceptable threshold, to be worked out by the National Revenue Mobilisation Allocation, and Fiscal Commission, at which recourse can be had to the Fund and for how long.
