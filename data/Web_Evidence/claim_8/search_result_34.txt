Noteworthy events
Cancer diagnosis (2025)
On May 18, 2025, Biden's personal office announced he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. In a statement, his office said, "While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management. The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians."[40]
Biden issued a statement on May 19, saying, "Cancer touches us all. Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support."[41]
Biden withdraws from presidential race (2024)
On July 21, 2024, President Joe Biden (D) announced on social media platform X that he was ending his campaign for re-election.[42] In a statement, Biden said:
| “ |
It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.[43] |
” |
In a separate post on X, Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris (D) to replace him at the top of the ticket: "Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats—it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this."[44]
Special counsel Robert Hur declined to prosecute Biden for handling of classified documents (2024)
On February 8, 2024, Robert Hur declined to prosecute Biden after an investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents after his vice presidency. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Hur to investigate Biden's improper storage of classified documents in January 2023. Hur's report said, "Our investigation uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen. [...] We conclude that the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt." The report said there was not enough evidence to prove Biden retained the documents willfully, that "at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory," and also mentioned Biden's cooperation in the investigation and willingness to return the documents.[45]
Biden held a press conference on February 8 responding to the report. At the press conference, Biden said, "I was pleased to see he reached a firm conclusion that no charges should be brought against me in this case. This was an exhaustive investigation going back more than 40 years, even into the 1970s, when I was still a new United States senator. And the special counsel acknowledged I cooperated completely." Biden also said, "In addition, I know there's some attention paid to some language in the report about my recollection of events. There's even reference that I don't remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that? [...] They don't know what they're talking about. It has no place in this report. The bottom line is the matter is now closed."[46]
This was one of three investigations into the handling of classified materials by individuals who had held executive office conducted by the Department of Justice (DoJ) around this time. The DoJ conducted a probe into former Vice President Mike Pence's (R) handling of classified documents beginning in January 2023, and decided against pressing charges in June 2023.[47] Garland also appointed special counsel Jack Smith to investigate former President Donald Trump's (R) handling of classified documents in November 2022.[48] Smith indicted Trump on 40 criminal counts, 32 of which were for the willful retention of national defense information, in June 2023.

Impeachment inquiry (2023)
- See also: Impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, 2023
Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) announced on September 12, 2023, that the House of Representatives would pursue an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden (D).[49] The inquiry focused on allegations that Biden used his influence as vice president from 2009 to 2017 to improperly profit from his son Hunter Biden's business dealings.[50]
House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), McCarthy's successor, scheduled a vote for December 7 to formally approve the ongoing impeachment inquiry.[51] The resolution was approved 221-212, and directed the Oversight, Ways and Means, and Judiciary committees to continue their investigations and set forth additional authorities for the committees related to inquiry proceedings.[52] From January 2023 to May 2024, these committees conducted hearings investigating Biden. No impeachment charges were put up for a vote.[53]
In a September 13 briefing, White House Press Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Republicans in Congress "have spent all year investigating the President. That’s what they’ve spent all year doing, and have turned up with no evidence — none — that he did anything wrong. [...] That is what we’ve heard over and over again from their almost year-long investigation. And that’s because the President didn’t do anything wrong."[54]
