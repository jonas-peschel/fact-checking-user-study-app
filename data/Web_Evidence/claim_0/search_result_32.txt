AVeriTeC (Automated Verification of Textual Claims) is a dataset of 4568 real-world claims covering fact-checks by 50 different organizations. Each claim is annotated with question-answer pairs supported by evidence available online, as well as textual justifications explaining how the evidence combines to produce a verdict. The Claims in AVeriTeC are classified into four labels: "Supported", "Refuted", "Not Enough Evidence", "Conflicting Evidence/Cherry-picking". The dataset also contains several fields of metadata such as the speaker of the claim, the publisher of the claim, the date the claim was published, and the location most relevant to the claim. These can be used to support questions, answers, and justifications.

@inproceedings{ schlichtkrull2023averitec, title={AVeriTeC: A Dataset for Real-world Claim Verification with Evidence from the Web}, author={Michael Sejr Schlichtkrull and Zhijiang Guo and Andreas Vlachos}, booktitle={Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track}, year={2023}, url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=fKzSz0oyaI} }
The dataset is formatted as JSON, with each split located as a separate file in the data-folder.
Each claim is an object of the following form:
claim

: True or False. Denotes that the claim received a second round of QG-QA and quality control annotation. label
: The annotated verdict for the claim. justification
: A textual justification explaining how the verdict was reached from the question-answer pairs. claim_date
: Our best estimate for the date the claim first appeared. speaker
: The person or organization that made the claim, e.g. Barrack Obama, The Onion. original_claim_url
: If the claim first appeared on the internet, a url to the original location. cached_original_claim_url
: Where possible, an archive.org link to the original claim url. fact_checking_article
: The fact-checking article we extracted the claim from. reporting_source
: The website or organization that first published the claim, e.g. Facebook, CNN. location_ISO_code
: The location most relevant for the claim. Highly useful for search. claim_types
: The types of the claim. fact_checking_strategies
: The strategies employed in the fact-checking article". questions
:
question
: A fact-checking question for the claim. answers
:
answer
: The answer to the question. answer_type

"question": "Is this study backed up by further research?",

{
"answer": "There\u2019s nothing wrong with this study in terms of its method or what it claims, but it shouldn\u2019t necessarily be taken to represent the experience of all children across the country. \n\nIt can\u2019t rule out the possibility that the mental toll of the pandemic may have been different across different parts of the country, and for people of different ages. \n\nFor example, a study out of the University of Oxford, asked parents and carers to report any changes in behavior of their children during a one-month period in lockdown. It found that while parents and carers reported that the emotional difficulties of adolescents decreased, the emotional difficulties of children aged four to ten increased. \n\nAlso a potential contributor to feelings of anxiety among students during the pandemic has been the uncertainty over exam results, which would have primarily affected students in years 11 and 13, not year 9 (as the study itself notes).",
