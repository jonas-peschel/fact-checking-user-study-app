Also Present: Senator Durbin. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES E. RISCH, U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO The Chairman. The United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee will come to order. We have an important--an important hearing this afternoon, obviously, as we talk about the president-elect's nomination of Antony J. Blinken to be secretary of state, and we will get to that very quickly. As a matter of personal privilege for just two minutes, every time I am sworn in for a new term I kind of think back. This is my--as I start my forty-first year as a member of the Senate body, I have learned some things over that period of time. I spent 28 years in our state senate, over two decades as leading it, and now 13 years here, and some things I have learned I can make, very briefly, an observation. If we treat each other with kindness and respect, we get things done. One of the best friends I had during my time in the state senate was the Democrat leader. We are still close personal friends. My wife and I stay with him when we travel to north Idaho. He consults with me frequently and gives me advice even when I do not want it, and we have become and stayed very, very good friends over the years. We always got things done in Idaho, and I hope that, as we go forward, that we will do likewise here. It is not only beginning of my forty-first year in the Senate body, this will be my fifty-third year married to my wife and my--after completing 36 elections I consider that all quite the accomplishment. So with that, we are going to proceed to hear from Mr. Blinken after we make our opening statements. But Senator Durbin has very, very important matters that he must attend to and we are honored to have him come and address this august body. And, Senator Durbin, the floor is yours. STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN, U.S. SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS Senator Durbin. Chairman Risch, thank you very much. It is great to be back in the committee, which I served on many years ago, and, Senator Menendez, thank you for your leadership and all of you who have gathered here today. I have been asked and I am honored that Mr. Blinken asked me to come before the committee and make an introduction. I am not going to do what most do and reread his entire biography, which you have all seen, I am sure, are impressed with as I am. I just want to make a few points about the job he seeks and the moment he seeks it. On September 12th, 2001, just hours after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the United States, the leading French newspaper, Le Monde, published a front-page headline of four words: Nous sommes tous Americains. We are all Americans. With those four words, the people of France acknowledged the danger and pain in the United States and quite simply said, we will stand with you. Despite many differences on many issues, that is what friends are for. That is the reason that alliances count. With the end of the Trump administration, we face a stark choice. Does America first mean America alone? Does our nation still need friends and allies? Over the past four years, many of the strongest bonds between America and our allies have been strained, lifelong friends have been shunned, and authoritarian adversaries have been embraced. The role of the United States and the world, its values, its allies, its adversaries, are in question. The world is waiting for a clear policy from our new president, and our new president has chosen one man to lead that effort, Tony Blinken. When you take a look at his background, it starts with the State Department, it includes service as staff director on this committee, with the National Security Council, working as deputy secretary of state. It is an amazing background. And there is also a moment, which I am sure you all have seen--we have seen over and over again. There was that iconic photograph in the Situation Room when approximately 12 people were gathered with the president and vice president of the United States and secretary of state to see if finally we would capture Osama bin Laden. Tony Blinken was in that room. It tells you that he was more than just a peripheral staffer. He was an integral part of the security decisions of the United States of America. He is ready for this job and we know it. There is one thing that we discussed before we walked in here that I think is a critical element, and that is the fact that he inherits a great department and many men and women who have dedicated their lives to the security of the United States of America. We need them. We see their expertise wherever we travel in every corner of the world, sometimes at great personal sacrifice. They are representing this country and, literally, risking their lives to do so. It is his job and he understands to thank them for their efforts and to make sure that the morale is at the highest level so that America continues to be well represented around the world. It is my honor to introduce Tony Blinken today as the next secretary of state. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Durbin. I know you have another things to do so we will excuse you and I will--what we are going to do here today is I am going to give some opening remarks. I am then going to turn it over to Senator Menendez for his opening remarks, and after that we will do a round of questioning. Each senator will be given 10 minutes. I will do it on a seniority basis, unlike our usual early bird process that we use. But because of the size of this I think that it is important that we have--we do it on the seniority basis. So with all that said, today's hearing is, unquestionably, significant. The secretary of state is one of, if not the, most important nominations that a president makes. He represents our interests abroad and is also looked to for defining America's role and posture in the world. Over the past several decades we have watched nations with authoritarian ideologies and imperial tendencies increasingly attempt to grow their influence on the world stage and, unfortunately, that has happened with some success on their part. These countries challenge the very principles on which the United States was founded, democracy and the rule of law. As the Biden administration begins tomorrow, there are several key foreign policy issues that need immediate attention. My most important concern, as Mr. Blinken and I talked about a few--in my office not long ago, is Iran, and the president-elect's promise to return to the JCPOA. President Obama thought the JCPOA would empower Iran moderates and see Iran abandon its nuclear weapons program. But this notion proved to be misplaced. The Iranian regime cannot separate itself from its revolutionary ideology. The JCPOA provided very beneficial sanctions relief for Iran. Yet, it failed to eliminate Iran's support for terrorist proxies, therefore, allowing them to fund terrorism across the region. The deal also included very shortsighted sunsets on Iranians' conventional weapons and ballistic missile programs, and allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium. Any new deal with Iran must address all the facets of Iranian behavior including its ballistic missile program and ending support for terrorism. I fully understand and I fully comprehend that people want to focus on their nuclear ambitions. But these people have other bad activities that they are involved in that also need to be addressed. Unfortunately, the Iranian regime thinks it has successfully waited out the maximum pressure program that we have had in place. Only time will tell if they are right. At the time, President Obama used the extensive sanctions regime Congress created as a leverage to begin the JCPOA talks, and so he should have. President-elect Biden should take advantage of the significant leverage that has been provided to the maximum pressure program and negotiate a new deal with--that includes Iran's regional aggression. A policy of containment rather than appeasement is the only approach that will be successful. Our very discussions with Iran should begin and end with our allies in the region. Israel and many of our other Gulf allies felt the United States abandoned them and their security concerns during the JCPOA negotiations. With U.S. leadership over the last four years, our relations were rebuilt and paved the way for the Abraham Accords. The Abraham Accords signed last year were a significant step in fundamentally improving the security, economic, and diplomatic environment in the Middle East. But they also underscored the significant threat that Iran poses to our regional partners. I would hope future negotiations with Iran would include extensive consultations with not just Congress but also Israel and our Gulf partners, and given its significant implications any new deal should also be submitted as a treaty for Senate ratifications. I understand that that is a controversial issue. But if we are going to have the support of the United States, it cannot just be one branch of government. It needs to be all branches of government. I hope that the Biden administration will adhere to these conditions before and during any engagement with Iran, and I sincerely appreciate, Mr. Blinken, your offer that prior to beginning or ending all of these negotiations there will be significant consultation with this committee. I greatly appreciate that. Another area of serious concern with the new administration, obviously, is China, which I believe will be our greatest foreign policy challenge of this century. On a personal note, I want to thank you, Mr. Blinken, for having read the 143-page report that I published just recently, and I also appreciate the kind words that you had for the conclusions and suggestions in that report. China is a strategic and global competitor of the United States and the Chinese Communist Party routinely engages in economic coercion, military aggression, human rights abuses, and influence operations. Its policies deliberately damage U.S. interests and values. In the face of the Chinese Communist Party's dangerous goals, the United States must maintain a strong competitive stance. Rising to the challenge is now a sprint and a marathon that will require sustained political will, expanded cooperation with allies and partners, and properly aligned resources and personnel. Last year, I introduced STRATEGIC Act, the first comprehensive legislative proposal to compete with China effectively. This bill was written with Democratic senators' input and other Democrat organizations around this city who are in the think tank business, along with Republican think tanks. And it should be noted that China is not a partisan issue. It is an American issue. I know Senator Menendez has strong concerns in this regard also and I hope we will work together as we move forward with those challenges. I hope and expect that the Biden administration will pursue bipartisan cooperation on challenges proposed by the Chinese Communist Party. One of those challenges is Taiwan. The PRC's obliteration of Hong Kong's autonomy last year makes the question of Taiwan's future all the more urgent and serious. China's military modernization and expansion has dramatically shifted the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific. This is eroding conventional deterrents, putting the U.S. military as well as Indo-Pacific allies and partners at risk. Taiwan is among the strategically consequential issues and should remain a key strategic priority. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved into the largest most destructive global health emergency in more than a century. More than 83 million people have been infected and 1.8 million people have died. Economies have been upended, schools and offices closed, and livelihoods destroyed. It will take years to recover from this global health catastrophe. There is a lot we still do not know about COVID-19 but two things are clear. Its global spread was accelerated by catastrophic failures at all levels of the existing global health security architecture, and unless we do something now it will happen again. Last year, I introduced an effort to help the United States and our international partners get ahead of the next pandemic. I, along with my committee colleagues, pressed the WHO to launch an independent interim review of its response to the outbreak so we could figure out what worked, what did not, and how to prepare for future outbreaks. WHO, ultimately, followed our suggestion. If confirmed, I am committed to working with you, Mr. Blinken, to advance reforms at the WHO that will help restore public confidence and enable it to more effectively respond to crisis in real time. I, along with Senator Murphy, Cardin, and Portman also introduced bipartisan legislation to strengthen the ability of the United States and our international partners to detect, prevent, and respond to outbreaks before they become pandemics. I am well aware that Senator Menendez also has a strong interest in this area and I look forward to working with him and with the committee as we move legislation forward. This bill, the Global Health Security and Diplomacy Act, provides much needed leadership and direction for U.S. global health security efforts overseas and incentivizes greater leadership and investment by others. I am also eager to work with you, Mr. Blinken, if confirmed, to further redefine and enact this important legislation. Over the last five years, the world has seen dramatic change and it is imperative policies are updated to reflect these new realities. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on these important issues and I thank you for being here today and I thank you and your family for the willingness to take on the sacrifice to serve in this important position. With that, Senator Menendez, the floor is yours. STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY Senator Menendez. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me, first of all, start off by saying I appreciate your efforts to work with me to get this hearing up today to expedite the consideration of one of the most important national security positions in our government, the secretary of state. So thank you. The Chairman. You are welcome, and I think all of us have a very strong interest in seeing that the president has in place as rapidly as possible his national security team. Thank you for that. Senator Menendez. I will say amen to that and I appreciate this and also, hopefully, if everything works out well the expeditious consideration at a committee meeting to vote out the nominee. Let me just say one remark. I will save my remarks about our future work together as a committee when the gavel changes. But as someone who has met our lovely wife, you are an incredibly fortunate man to have had over a half a century with her as a partner. The Chairman. No one knows better than I. Thank you, Senator. Senator Menendez. Congratulations to you on such a great long time together. She is just an incredibly charming person. Mr. Blinken, congratulations on your nomination. You are superbly qualified and prepared to be our next secretary of state and you have impressed us all over the years with your intellect, your dedication, and your humanity, including during your successful tenure as deputy secretary of state, deputy national security advisor, and as staff director of this committee. Now, while tomorrow's inauguration is a time for healing and renewal, I am nonetheless compelled to speak about the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th. The images from that day are permanently seared in our collective conscience. Terrorists defiling the Capitol with Confederate flags and Nazi images, seeking to take hostage or perhaps kill our democratically elected leaders, savagely beating police officers, and in that respect my heart goes out to the family of New Jersey native and Capitol police officer Brian Sicknick who succumbed to the those injuries, and the family of Capitol police officer Howard Liebengood as well as dozens of other officers injured in the attack. This attack on the very foundation of our democracy delivered a tragic reminder, that our ability to project power abroad is inextricably linked to the health and strength of our democracy. This does not mean that we cannot talk about the importance of democracy abroad, no, but, rather, we must show that senators and all other leaders in this country have a duty to stand up for democracy, for the Constitution, for the rule of law. There can be no exceptions, and I expect that from the Biden administration and, based on my experience, I know, Mr. Blinken, you will do so in word and deed. Now, if confirmed, your task will be to repair and restore America's place in the world. You will face complex challenges all over the globe. The world is on fire. Rebuilding alliances, restoring American leadership at international institutions, tackling problems that define our times and defy borders like climate change, migration, and COVID-19, and you will need to re-center our foreign policy around the core American values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. But you will need to do so thoughtfully. Over the past year, the world has watched the United States completely falter on a national response to COVID-19, continue its overdue reckoning with systemic racism, and struggle with the president's obsession with thwarting the peaceful transfer of power, pushing disinformation, and attacking a free press. As we work to advance American interests around the globe and seek to create a more democratic, prosperous, and secure world, we have to redouble our efforts at home to secure a more perfect union for all Americans. Now, as you are likely aware, North Korea, Russia, and Turkey require some immediate attention. Over the past four years, North Korea's nuclear and missile programs have continued to grow unchecked. In other words, the United States and our allies are more at risk now than after four years of President Trump than when he took office. A revanchist Russia continues to threaten the United States and our allies including to the recent SolarWinds cyber-attack, the spread of disinformation, and efforts to silence and murder political opposition. And Turkey continues to be destabilizing by supporting Azerbaijan's aggression in Nagorno-Karabakh and to its own aggressive behavior in the eastern Mediterranean against our democratic allies Greece and Cyprus. From a broader regional perspective, one of your most important challenges will be to forge a coherent strategy for the Indo-Pacific, one led by our values, centered on our allies and partners, and implemented with consistency. As you know, I believe that while the Trump administration got some of the questions about the region right, they came up with the wrong answers. At a time when we should have been strengthening our alliances, building new partnerships, empowering a multilateral architecture, expanding commercial ties, and ensuring the vitality of democracy and the rule of law, the Trump administration in almost every case did the exact opposite, and after four years of the Trump administration we are in a worse position to effectively compete with China than before. So I am interested in hearing more about what your top priorities will be if confirmed in approaching the Indo-Pacific region and how our China policy nests within this larger framework. We also have a number of ongoing challenges in the Middle East, perhaps none so pressing as Iran. As you know, I was not a proponent of the JCPOA, but I also believe the Trump administration's decision to withdraw without a serious strategy involving our allies would ultimately leave us less safe and Iran emboldened. Unfortunately, Iran's continuing aggression across the Middle East and its recent nuclear activity that has dramatically advanced its capabilities has vindicated that prediction. Now, I understand the Biden administration is interested in returning to a diplomatic path, which I support. But I fear returning to the JCPOA without concrete efforts to address Iran's other dangerous and destabilizing activity would be insufficient. I believe there is bipartisan support to find a comprehensive diplomatic approach with Iran that includes working closely with our European and regional partners if we take those other issues into consideration. Closer to home, political crises in Latin America have caused human rights and humanitarian disasters on an unprecedented scale. Simply put, addressing rampant crime, weak governance, corruption, climate- related displacement in the Northern Triangle must be a top priority for the country and deeply impacts the security and economic well-being of Americans. Further south, I am encouraged by the Biden administration's plans to renew our commitment to the multilateral efforts we must lead in order to improve the effectiveness of international sanctions and humanitarian aid as we pursue a diplomatic solution to the Venezuelan crisis. Maduro's campaign of crimes against humanity and attacks against interim president Juan Guaid cents and democratic civil society, which I hope the administration will recognize interim President Guaid cents, all have serious implications for U.S. national security and regional stability. And, Mr. Blinken, I also hope you support Ambassador Bill Richardson's efforts to free the six Americans who have been unjustly detained in Venezuela. I am confident that, if confirmed, you will do everything you can to repair and restore American leadership abroad. Foundational to that effort will be rebuilding and reinvigorating the State Department itself. As you well know, our career foreign and civil servants are incredibly talented and dedicated. Over the past few years, however, they have been treated with disdain, smeared, and forced out of public service. There has been a stunning loss of expertise, steep declines in morale, little accountability for those at the top, and the State Department still has not achieved a workforce that comes close to reflecting the diversity of our country. This state of affairs has impacted relationships across the globe, the department's ability to engage in the interagency process, and in its relationship with Congress. So the challenges you will be facing are immense but I have confidence in your experience and expertise. I look forward to hearing your testimony, and upon confirmation I look forward to working with you to restore America's place in the world and to repair and rebuild our relationships and our institutions. Thank you, Mr. Chair. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Menendez. Mr. Blinken, after our conversations earlier today and after hearing our opening statements, Senator Menendez's input in that regard, as you can see, there isn't a whole lot of daylight between us on most of these issues, certainly, almost none whatsoever when it comes to objectives, strategy, and how to get there is, obviously, something that needs to be negotiated and all of our best heads put together to try to get to that position. So we are interested in hearing that. Obviously, as Senator Menendez said, Iran is at the top of the list. China and Russia are right behind that. We have serious problems in Turkey. North Korea is on the list and there is lots and lots of challenges. But we will do better if we all pull the wagon together, and I think we are headed in that direction right now. So with that, again, thank you for your willingness to serve and the floor is yours. STATEMENT OF ANTONY J. BLINKEN, OF NEW YORK, NOMINATED TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE Mr. Blinken. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and to you, to Ranking Member Menendez, to all the members of this committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here today and I greatly appreciate everything you have done to make this hearing possible at this time. And I want to thank Senator Durbin in absentia for his very kind introduction. It is, truly, the honor of a lifetime to appear before this committee as President-elect Biden's nominee to be secretary of state, and it is an honor that carries special significance for me for two reasons. First, as you have noted, I had the privilege of serving as the Democratic staff director of this committee for six years, working alongside a distinguished group of senators, including several still on the committee today, to advance diplomacy and safeguard the interests of the American people. That experience gave me an abiding respect for this committee, for its finest bipartisan traditions, for the caliber of its members and staff, for the essential work it does to strengthen U.S. leadership around the world. If I have the honor of being confirmed, those lessons that I learned in my years with this committee will guide my approach to our work together. The second point of significance for me is a little bit more personal. In addition to my own confirmation as deputy secretary of state, this committee confirmed my wife, Evan Ryan, who is here with me today, as assistant secretary of state for education and cultural affairs, confirmed my uncle, Alan Blinken, as ambassador to Belgium, and confirmed my father, Donald Blinken, as ambassador to Hungary. I hope I do not break the streak today. My family, especially my wife and our children, John and Lila, is my greatest blessing. Our tradition of public service is the source of tremendous pride. I view that tradition as something of a sacred duty, payment on the debt that our family owes to the nation that gave so many of my relatives refuge and extraordinary opportunities across the generations. My grandfather, Maurice Blinken, found refuge in America after fleeing Russian pogroms. My father's wife, Vera Blinken, found refuge in America after fleeing the communist regime in Hungary, and my late stepfather, Samuel Pisar, found refuge in America after enduring the horrors of the Holocaust. Sam was the only survivor among his immediate family and school of 900 children in Bialystok, Poland, after four years in the concentration camps. At the end of the war, he made a break from a death march into the Bavarian woods, and from his hideout he heard the rumbling sound of the tank, and as he looked out, instead of seeing the dreaded iron cross, he saw a five-pointed white star. And so he ran to the tank and got to it. The hatch opened. An African-American GI looked down at him. He fell to his knees and said the only three words that he knew in the English language that his mother had taught him before the war, ``God bless America.'' The GI lifted him into the tank, into freedom, into America. That is who we are. That is what we represent to the world, however imperfectly, and what we can still be when we are at our best. If I have the honor of serving as secretary of state, that is the vision that I will pursue, a vision articulated often by President-elect Biden, doubtlessly informed by his time on this committee when he said that the United States is a nation that leads not only by the example of our power but by the power of our example. If confirmed, three priorities would guide my time as secretary of state. First, I will work with you to reinvigorate the Department of State, investing in its greatest asset, the Foreign Service officers, the civil servants, the locally- employed staff who animate American diplomacy. I know from firsthand experience their passion, their energy, their courage, often far from home, away from loved ones, sometimes in dangerous conditions exacerbated now by the pandemic. They deserve our full support. If I am confirmed as secretary, they will have it. I am committed to advancing our security and prosperity by building a diplomatic core that fully represents America in all its talent and in all its diversity, recruiting, retaining, promoting officers with the skills to contend with 21st century challenges, and who look like the country we represent, sparing no effort to ensure their safety and well-being, demanding accountability starting with the secretary of state, for building a more diverse, inclusive, and nonpartisan workforce. Second, working across government and with partners around the world, we will revitalize American diplomacy to deal with and take on the most pressing challenges of our time. We will show up again, day in and day out, whenever and wherever Americans' prosperity and security is at stake, and we will engage the world not as it was but as it is, a world of rising nationalism, receding democracy, growing rivalry from China and Russia and other authoritarian states, mounting threats to a stable and open international system, and a technological revolution that is reshaping every aspect of our lives, especially in cyberspace. But for all that has changed, I believe some things remain constant. American leadership still matters. The reality is the world simply does not organize itself. When we are not engaged, when we are not leading, then one of two things is likely to happen. Either some other country tries to take our place but not in a way that is likely to advance our interests and values, or, maybe just as bad, no one does and then you have chaos. Either way, that does not serve the American people. I believe that humility and confidence should be the flip sides of America's leadership coin; humility, because we have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad, and humility because most of the world's problems are not about us in the first instance, even as they affect us, and no single country acting alone, even one as powerful as the United States, can fully and effectively address these problems. But we will also act with confidence, with the confidence that America at its best still has a greater ability than any country on earth to mobilize others for the common good. Guided by these principles, I believe we can and we will overcome the COVID crisis, the greatest shared challenge since World War II. We can out-compete China and remind the world that a government of the people, for the people can deliver for its people. We can take on the existential threat posed by climate change. We can revitalize our core alliances, force multipliers of our influence around the world. Together we are far better positioned to counter threats from Russia, Iran, North Korea, and to stand up for democracy and human rights. And in everything we do around the world I believe that we can and we must ensure that our foreign policy is actually working to deliver for American working families here at home. Let me conclude, if I may, Mr. Chairman, with a word about this institution, whose resilience and determination were on full display in the aftermath of the senseless and searing violence in these halls. But the president-elect and I believe that we have to restore Congress' traditional role as a partner in our foreign policy-making. In recent years, across administrations of both parties, Congress' voice in foreign policy has been diluted and diminished. That does not make the executive branch stronger. It makes our country weaker. President-elect Biden believes, and I share his conviction, that no foreign policy can be sustained without the informed consent of the American people. You are the representatives of the American people. You provide that advice and consent. We can only tackle the most urgent challenges we have if we work together, and I am dedicated to doing just that. And so if I am confirmed, my commitment is to work with each and every one of you on behalf of all Americans. Thank you for the time. Thank you for the consideration. I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Blinken follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Antony J. Blinken Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Menendez, and members of the committee--thank you for the opportunity to be here today. And thank you, Senator Durbin, for your kind introduction. It is the honor of a lifetime to appear before this committee as President-elect Biden's nominee for Secretary of State--and an honor which carries special significance for me for two reasons. First, I had the privilege of serving as staff director of this committee for six years--working alongside a distinguished group of Senators, including several who remain on the committee today, to advance American diplomacy and safeguard the interests of the American people.

If I have the honor of being confirmed, those lessons I learned in my years with this committee will guide my approach to our work together. The second point of significance is more personal. In addition to my own confirmation as DeputySecretary of State six years ago, this committee confirmed my wife Evan Ryan as Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs, my uncle Alan Blinken as Ambassador to Belgium, and my father Donald Blinken as Ambassador to Hungary. My family--especially my wife and our children, John and Lila--is my greatest blessing. Our tradition of public service is a source of tremendous pride. I view that tradition as a sacred duty--payment on the debt our family owes to the nation that gave us refuge and extraordinary opportunities across the generations. My grandfather, Maurice Blinken, found refuge in America after fleeing the Russian pogroms. My father's wife, Vera Blinken, found refuge in America after fleeing the communist regime in Hungary. And my late step-father, Samuel Pisar, found refuge in America after enduring the horrors of the Holocaust. Sam was the only survivor among his immediate family and school of 900 in Bialystok, Poland after four years in the concentration camps. At the end of the war, he made a break from a death march into the Bavarian woods. From his hiding place, he heard the rumbling sound of a tank. Instead of an Iron Cross, he saw a five-pointed white star. He ran to the tank. The hatch opened. An African American GI looked down at him. He fell to his knees and said the only three words he knew in English that his mother had taught him: God Bless America. The GI lifted him into the tank, into America, into freedom. That's who we are. That's what we represent to the world, however imperfectly, and what we can still be at our best. If I have the honor of serving as Secretary of State, that is the vision I will pursue--a vision articulated often by President-elect Biden, and doubtlessly informed by his long service to this committee, of a nation that leads ``not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.'' If confirmed, three priorities will guide my time as Secretary. First, I will work with you to reinvigorate the Department by investing in its greatest asset: the foreign service officers, civil servants, and locally employed staff who animate American diplomacy around the world. I know from firsthand experience their passion, energy, and courage. Often far from home and away from loved ones, sometimes in dangerous conditions exacerbated by the global pandemic--they deserve our full support. If I am confirmed as Secretary, they will have it. I am committed to advancing our security and prosperity by building a diplomatic corps that fully represents America in all its talent and diversity. Recruiting, retaining, and promoting officers with the skills to contend with 21st Century challenges and who look like the country we represent. Sparing no effort to ensure their safety and well-being. Demanding accountability--starting with the Secretary--for building a more diverse, inclusive and non-partisan workplace. Second, working across government and with partners around the world, we will revitalize American diplomacy to take on the most pressing challenges of our time. We'll show up again, day-in, day-out whenever and wherever the safety and well-being of Americans is at stake. We'll engage the world not as it was, but as it is. A world of rising nationalism, receding democracy, growing rivalry with China, Russia, and other authoritarian states, mounting threats to a stable and open international system, and a technological revolution that is reshaping every aspect of our lives, especially in cyberspace. For all that has changed, some things remain constant. American leadership still matters. The reality is that the world doesn't organize itself. When we're not engaged, when we don't lead, then one of two things happen: either some other country tries to take our place, but probably not in a way that advances our interests or values. Or no one does, and then you get chaos. Either way, that does not serve the American people Humility and confidence should be the flip sides of America's leadership coin. Humility because we have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad. And humility because most of the world's problems are not about us, even as they affect us. Not one of the big challenges we face can be met by one country acting alone--even one as powerful as the U.S. But we'll also act with confidence that America at its best still has a greater ability than any country on earth to mobilize others for the greater good. Guided by those principles, we can overcome the COVID crisis--the greatest shared challenge since World War II. We can outcompete China--and remind the world that a government of the people, by the people, can deliver for its people. We can take on the existential threat posed by climate change. We can revitalize our core alliances--force multipliers of our influence around the world. Together, we are far better positioned to counter threats posed by Russia, Iran, and North Korea and to stand up for democracy and human rights. And in everything we do around the world, we can and we must ensure that our foreign policy delivers for American working families here at home. Let me conclude with a word about this institution, whose resilience and determination was on full display in the aftermath of senseless and searing violence in these halls. Both the President-elect and I believe we must restore Congress's traditional role as a partner in our foreign policy making. In recent years, across administrations of both parties, Congress's voice in foreign policy has been diluted and diminished. That doesn't make the executive branch stronger--it makes our country weaker. President-elect Biden believes--and I share his conviction--that no foreign policy can be sustained without the informed consent of the American people. You are the representatives of the American people. You provide that advice and consent. We can only tackle the most urgent problems our country faces if we work together, and I am dedicated to doing that. If confirmed, I will work as a partner to each of you on behalf of all Americans. Thank you for your consideration--I look forward to answering your questions. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Blinken, and, of course, your words about working with us is music to our ears. We will be happy to be a partner with you in that regard. So with that, we will proceed to a round of questions, 10 minutes per senator. I am going to reserve my time and I am going to yield to Senator Menendez. Senator Menendez. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Blinken, thank you for your statement. During our meeting yesterday, we discussed the department will need to repair and rebuild its relationship with this committee. I think it is after 28 years of doing public foreign policy in the House and the Senate I have never seen a moment like this in terms of our relationship with the State Department. So, and having heard your opening statement, I am confident you understand the importance of a constructive relationship between the department and Congress. So I just have a few quick questions I have always asked the secretary of state nominee. I would like to ask you. You can answer yes or no. I would appreciate it. Do you agree that the State Department is accountable to Congress and the American people? Mr. Blinken. Yes. Senator Menendez. Do you commit that the department will keep this committee fully and currently informed on the department's activities? Mr. Blinken. I do. Senator Menendez. Do you understand and agree that a constructive relationship between the department and this committee requires meaningful engagement and consultation with the committee while policies are being developed, not after the fact, and can you commit to ensuring that type of meaningful engagement? Mr. Blinken. Yes, I do, and I can. Senator Menendez. Thank you very much. Let me turn to Iran. This is going to be one of the most difficult challenges early on because Iran has accelerated. The maximum pressure campaign did not stop it from its acceleration. We were broken away from our allies. We could not even get from our traditional allies a vote at the United Nations on the--continuing the arms embargo and that is not a good recipe to counter Iran. So I think there is a will to work together in a serious diplomatic engagement with Iran. But some of our concerns about the JCPOA, obviously, time has lapsed. The sunset is closer. Some of the other issues are now--have come to the fore in terms of the JCPOA, and then you have all of Iran's other destabilizing activities. So some of us have worked--Senator Graham, a member of the committee, and I have worked along with others in thinking about how something along the lines of returning to the JCPOA but with a commitment, a process by which the Iranians would have to deal with some of the challenges left by the JCPOA and other issues, looking at the possibility of a regional fuel bank so that not only the Iranians but those in the Gulf would be able to participate to receive nuclear fuel for domestic peaceful consumption but not enrichment. It could defuse a tinderbox in the region if all these countries are looking now to enrich. Those are some ideas, not the totality of it. Can you give us a sense of where you are looking at with reference to Iran, and as part of that, are you going to proactively reach out to Congress in order to forge such a consensus that can move us together with one voice towards meeting Iran as a challenge? Mr. Blinken. Thank you very much, Senator. Let me answer the last question first, in terms of reaching out, and the answer is yes, absolutely, especially on a policy as challenging as the one that we have to deal with when it comes to Iran. We are much better off if we can try to work through and think through these issues together and you have my commitment that we intend and will do that, and I look forward to the consultations and conversations that we have. When it comes to Iran, a couple of things. First, President-elect Biden is committed to the proposition that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon and we share, I know, that goal across this committee. An Iran with a nuclear weapon or on the threshold of having one or the capacity to build one on short order would be an Iran that is even more dangerous than it already is when it comes to all of the other malicious activities that it is engaged in, whether it is support for terrorism, whether it is fueling and feeding its proxies, whether it is destabilizing the region. An Iran with a nuclear weapon or with the threshold capacity to build one is an Iran that would act, potentially, with even greater impunity than it already is. So I think we have an urgent responsibility to do whatever we can to prevent Iran from acquiring or getting a weapon or getting close to the capacity to having the fissile material to break out on short notice. In my judgment, the JCPOA, for whatever its limitations, was succeeding on its own terms in blocking Iran's pathways to producing fissile material for a nuclear weapon on short order. It also featured, and a feature that continues, the most intrusive inspections and monitoring regime in the history of arms control. The challenge we face now is that we pulled out of the agreement. Iran is now taking steps to undo the various constraints that were imposed on it by the agreement. And so it has increased its stockpile of low-enriched uranium. It is now enriching at a higher level. It is deploying centrifuges in ways that were prohibited under the agreement. The result is, based on public reporting, the breakout time, the time it would take Iran to produce enough fissile material for one weapon, has gone from beyond a year, as it was under the JCPOA, to about three or four months, based at least on public reporting, and that potentially brings us right back to the crisis point that we were reaching before the deal was negotiated. And so the president-elect believes that if Iran comes back into compliance we would, too. But we would use that as a platform with our allies and partners who would once again be on the same side with us to seek a longer and stronger agreement and also, as you and the chairman have rightly pointed out, to capture these other issues, particularly with regard to missiles and Iran's destabilizing activities. That would be the objective. Having said that, I think we are a long way from there. We would have to see, once the president-elect is in office, what steps Iran actually takes and is prepared to take. We would then have to evaluate whether they were actually making good if they say they are coming back into compliance with their obligations, and then we would take it from there. But in the first instance, the last thing I will say on this, sir, is that yes, we absolutely will consult with you and not only with you, I think, as the chairman suggested, it is also vitally important that we engage on the take off, not the landing, with our allies and with our partners in the region to include Israel and to include the Gulf countries. Senator Menendez. Thank you. Now, so I am all for stronger and longer and very much glad to hear that these other issues also will--the administration will look forward to engage and challenge Iran on. I think those are important. Let me turn to China. Many of us, certainly, Senator Romney, since my first meeting with him when he came to the Senate, has made China one of the focal points and he is right about the challenge that China poses. The chairman talked about his initiative. We, meaning Democrats, introduced a couple of months ago the America LEADS Act, which brought all of the relevant committees--finance, on trade, commerce, on technology, armed services, just about everybody--in a comprehensive national strategy to deal with China, which deals with both investments here at home because some of us believe we must not only confront China, we must compete with China to be successful-- diplomacy, alliances, security, values, and trade to create a truly competitive approach, and I believe this is one of the most significant national security challenges we will have, as well as economic challenges. Can you speak a little bit about to--how do you see that? Mr. Blinken. First of all, I have read and applaud the LEADS Act and I have also read the very good report that the chairman did on China and applaud virtually everything that is in it. I think there is a very strong foundation there upon which to build a bipartisan policy with regard to China. As we look at China, there is no doubt that it poses the most significant challenge of any nation state to the United States in terms of our interests, the interests of the American people. There are, as I see it, rising adversarial aspects to the relationship, certainly, competitive ones, and still some cooperative ones when it is in our mutual interest. I think as we are thinking about how to deal with China, and I think this is reflected in the work that the committee has done, we have to start by approaching China from a position of strength, not weakness, and the good news is our ability to do that is, largely, within our control. A position of strength when we are working with, not denigrating, our allies--that is a source of strength for us in dealing with China. A position of strength when we are engaged and leading in international institutions, not pulling back and ceding the terrain to China to write the rules and norms that animate those institutions. A position of strength when we stand up for our values when human rights are being abused in Xinjiang or when democracy is being trampled in Hong Kong. Our ability to make the investments in ourselves, as you pointed out, that is a source of strength, investments as necessary in our military to make sure that we can deter any aggression. All of these things are fully within our control, and if we come together and do them I think we can then deal with the specific challenges that China poses from that position of strength, not a position of weakness. Senator Menendez. Thank you. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Menendez. Senator Johnson? Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Blinken, welcome. Let me start out by saying I got a phone call from a former contact in the Obama/Biden administration. I won't name the individual because I do not want to get that person in trouble. But it was a very welcome phone call. I think the--to summarize it, it started out saying that we are really in an unsustainable position in this country. We are so grossly divided, and particularly in areas of foreign policy. The standard saying is politics ought to end at the water's edge. I hope that can be true. I do not think it ever has been completely true. But I think there are some really good areas of agreement. And so it is a very sincere attempt to reach out and say, let us try and focus on areas of agreement, and, by the way, as chairman, ranking member on the European Subcommittee with this Nord Stream 2, the European Energy Security and Diversification Act with Senator Murphy, we found those areas of agreement. So I really want to focus on that because I think that is one of the areas--one of the ways we can try and narrow that divide, which I think is just completely unsustainable in this nation. I think one of the areas I think we can all agree on is the world is a very dangerous and complicated place, and there is just no doubt about it. There is not a whole lot of black and white. There is black and white, but there is a lot of gray areas and how you address whether it is Iran or North Korea or China or Russia is difficult situations. So I have no doubt that you have just a wealth of knowledge, as did Secretary Kerry. I think there is a difference between knowledge, though, and judgment. And so in all sincerity, I just really want to talk to you about judgment and, again, I know you take a look at the Trump administration and it is, like, all bad. I do not think that is true, and so let me start out what I think are our foreign policy accomplishments and whether you see whether or not you agree. First of all, we did get our NATO partners to invest more in NATO, and that is a good thing, right? Do you have any reservations about that? Mr. Blinken. I do not. Senator Johnson. I think the peace or the agreements between Israel and Bahrain and UAE and Sudan and Morocco, those are good things. You are going to want to build on that, correct? Mr. Blinken. I very much agree. Senator Johnson. Just a quick aside, again, knowledge versus judgment. It is something that Secretary Kerry thought was not possible whatsoever. Again, that is a judgment call. I understand that. But it has been proven wrong, and I guess I am kind of looking for an acknowledgment that maybe past judgments have been overtaken by new knowledge and as times we have moved on. One thing pretty near and dear to my heart is the agreement, the economic agreement between Kosovo and Serbia. Wess Mitchell sent me over to Serbia and Kosovo a number of times and, you know, I do not want to take blame for this but the situation was not improving until Ric Grenell got involved and came up with the idea, let us--okay, a lot of these things they are not going to agree on but what they can agree on is economic advancement since we got an agreement. That is a good thing, correct? Mr. Blinken. I agree. Senator Johnson. What kind of troubles me about the past record of the Obama/Biden administration, again, dealing with difficult situations. But I just want to give you the opportunity to discuss whether you have had any second thoughts on, for example, what happened in Libya. That is where--and you talked about American leadership-- that is where President Obama famously said, ``We are going to lead from behind,'' and, you know, the world community kind of blew up Libya. It did not turn out so well. We had Benghazi. Do you have any second thoughts in terms of what happened with Libya? Mr. Blinken. I do, and let me--before I address that, Senator, I would like to say I believe that no one, no party, has a monopoly on good ideas, and I hope that, working together, we can pool all the good ideas from both sides of the aisle to try to advance the security and well-being of the American people abroad. I welcome doing that. Second, very quickly, I think there are a number of things, from where I sat, that the Trump administration did beyond our borders that I would applaud. You mentioned a couple of them. The Abraham Accords, absolutely. Now, there are certain commitments that may have been made in the context of getting those countries to normalize relations with Israel that I think we should take a hard look at, and I imagine the committee feels the same way. But the work that was done to push forward on normalization with Israel I applaud. It makes Israel safer. It makes the region safer. It is a good thing, and yes, I would hope that we could build on that as well. You mentioned the work on Kosovo and Serbia. I applaud that as well. The president-elect, as you know, spent a lot of time on those countries in the past and I think he shares your conviction that there are things we can do to help move Kosovo forward and also, hopefully, move Serbia forward. And, certainly, getting our NATO allies to invest more is a good thing. I think that is shared across administrations and across parties. And finally, let me just say that I also believe that President Trump was right in taking a tougher approach to China. I disagree very much with the way that he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one and I think that is actually helpful to our foreign policy. Senator Johnson. No, I think--I think President Trump opens everybody's eyes in terms of China's malign intent. Again, I want to kind of quickly go through---- Mr. Blinken. But on Libya---- Senator Johnson [continuing]. Libya, Syria---- Mr. Blinken. Sure. Senator Johnson [continuing]. You know, not providing lethal defensive weaponry to Ukraine. Are those things you have given second thoughts to? Mr. Blinken. Yes. With regard to Libya, here was the situation we faced. We had Muammar Gaddafi saying that he was going to slaughter like rats those opposing him, including all of the inhabitants of Benghazi, and we faced what looked like the potential for a mass atrocity that was heading our way, and what was unique about the moment was the United Nations supported doing something about it--the Security Council. The partners and allies in the region did, and our allies in Europe did, too. Having said that, and so I think the good news from where I sat--and I supported that effort. In fact, I think it has been written about. I was the president-elect's national security advisor at the time and he did not agree with that course of action and so--but he--we had the kind of relationship where I was able to say what I thought and, as you have noted, we intervened. Here is what I think we misjudged. First, we did not fully appreciate the fact that one of the things Gaddafi had done over the years was to make sure that there was no possible rival to his power and, as a result, there was no effective bureaucracy, no effective administration in Libya with which to work when he was gone. That made things much more challenging than I think we understood---- Senator Johnson. Okay. So, again, because I want to--so basically, there was no plan afterwards? That is something-- that is the lesson you have learned? Mr. Blinken. I think there was a--I think there was a plan that ran into--ran into some reality, that, unfortunately, the result has been that there has been more space in Libya for extremist groups who filled some of the vacuum left by Gaddafi. Senator Johnson. Okay. One of the things that Congress did unanimously is we approved $300 million of lethal defensive weaponry for Ukraine the Obama administration never implemented. The Trump administration did. Do you still disagree with providing that lethal defensive weaponry or do you think, you know, over time now that has been proven to be the correct decision by Congress and the Trump administration? Mr. Blinken. Senator, I support providing that lethal defensive assistance to Ukraine. In fact, I had the opportunity to write exactly that in The New York Times about three years ago. Senator Johnson. One of the comments, and this is--to prepare for this hearing, and I am not going to enter this into the record but my staff did provide me Senator McCain's 2014 floor speech, which I am sure you have read. It was---- Mr. Blinken. I know it well. Senator Johnson [continuing]. Pretty blistering. It is one of the reasons I thought I would kind of give you the opportunity to maybe respond. But the Chairman also provided a list of questions and one of the questions he asked about Soleimani. I mean, is it a good thing that Soleimani is off the battlefield? And I was surprised because you remained adamant that it did not improve our national security. I mean, I would take the opposite side of that viewpoint. Do you want to try and explain that one? I mean, I think because--because he was a mastermind, because he was so effective, because he was responsible for hundreds of American lives lost. I do not see how you cannot agree that that was-- that enhances our national security. Mr. Blinken. No one is shedding a tear for the demise of Qasem Soleimani and, certainly, when I was last in office I saw firsthand the blood that he had on his hands. So no one regrets the fact that he is no longer there. I think from where I sat, Senator, the question is not whether taking him out was the right thing to do. It was gaming out what might be the consequences and asking ourselves whether, on balance, we would be left safer or not in taking that action. Previous administrations, including the Bush administration and the Obama administration, concluded that we would not be, and I think what we saw after his death, including attacks on our positions in Iraq that left dozens if not hundreds of Americans with brain injuries, the fact that our forward posts in Iraq that were there to prevent the reemergence of ISIL had to pull back because of concerns that Iranian-backed militia after Soleimani's death would attack them, the fact that we are talking about, apparently, closing our embassy in Baghdad again for fear of the actions of these militia, and the fact that we have seen Iran acting out in a whole variety of ways because we are not the only actor in this drama, I think, on balance that that action actually left us less safe, not more safe. Senator Johnson. Okay. Well, he was in Baghdad for a reason, probably to plan further attacks. We do not know what he might have done, but I appreciate your answer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. Let us move to--Senator Cardin, I believe, is joining us online. Senator Cardin, are you there? Senator Cardin. I am with you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you very much, and to Mr. Blinken, first, thank you for your public service. Thank you for your willingness to serve in this critically important position at this time in American history. I very much appreciate on a personal basis having the opportunity to learn from you during my first two years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when you were the Democratic staff director, and I still remember those first two years. So I thank you very much for your public service. I want to ask you some questions in regards to a troubling trend we have seen globally on the decline of democracy. Freedom House has observed that in 2019 we had the fourteenth consecutive year of the decline in global freedom. Human Rights Watch says that the--in its 2021 report that the Trump administration was a disaster for the protection of human rights, and President-elect Biden observed that democracy is under more pressure than any time since the 1930s. So my question to you is whether you are prepared to make the preservation of democracy, good governance, human rights, and anti-corruption a priority--a top priority within the State Department? Which requires the use of resources devoted to protecting democracy, whether it is at USAID or whether it is the resources in our missions in each of our countries, which will be made a priority to help preserve democracies around the world and the protection of human rights and anti-corruption activities. Mr. Blinken. Senator, first of all, it is good to see you, and the short answer is yes, absolutely. The president-elect has been very clear that our charge would be to put democracy and human rights back at the center of American foreign policy and we intend to do just that. That is a question of resources. It is a question of focus. It is a question of commitment. Of course, a lot of this begins at home. Our ability to be a strong leader for and defender of democracy and human rights also depends to a large extent on the strength of our own democracy here at home, and as we have already discussed, we have some work to do on that account. You are absolutely right when you cite the backsliding we have seen. Freedom House has been tracking this, as many of you know, for decades and of the 40 or so countries that were ranked, consistently ranked, fully free in the '80s, '90s, and early 2000s, fully half of them have been backsliding on democratic metrics, and so this poses a real challenge. One of the goals that the president-elect has set for us is to try to convene a summit of democracies within the first year of his administration to bring democratic countries together, to think together, both about some of the challenges that we face at home that are common to democracies including rising populism, but also to think about a common agenda as we are dealing with the work of defending and advancing democracy around the world to include combating corruption, to include standing up more effectively freedom and rights, to include having a united voice in calling out abuses of democracy or abuses of human rights. This is something that I hope we will be able to put together toward the end of this year and something that we would very much welcome the participation of members of Congress and particularly members of this committee. Senator Cardin. I thank you for that. I would also urge you to be as aggressive as you can with the budget director as to resources being devoted to democracy, because it has been a very small slice of USAID's budget and we just--and the mission support is not as strong as I think it should be. I want to talk about one of the tools that has gotten the most international attention and that is the Magnitsky sanctions. It was interesting that it has been recorded that was the first issue brought up by Mr. Putin when he met with President Trump. Are you committed to working with us to strengthen the Magnitsky global sanction regime to go against those actors that are not held accountable in their own states for gross violations of human rights and corruption? Mr. Blinken. Yes, I am, and I should just add that I think this has been a great achievement, Senator, of yours and of this committee. We have gone from Magnitsky to Global Magnitsky to different countries now adopting their own Magnitsky like laws, and now just recently the European Union. So I think this has been a tremendous success story in actually bringing the democratic countries of the world together and giving them an effective tool to actually push back against abuses of democracy and human rights. Senator Cardin. I plan to introduce legislation shortly in regards to Magnitsky to deal with the sunset that is provided in the statute currently, to remove that, but also to strengthen some of the areas. There are ways that we can strengthen the Global Magnitsky through the State Department--getting more countries to adopt Global Magnitsky statutes, to make sure they are comprehensive and include corruption, and to make sure you have adequate staffing so that you can implement the law fully. I would also recommend that you follow the leads given to us by NGOs that, in many cases, have information that otherwise would not be made available to us to hold abusers accountable. I think these are all suggestions that could help strengthen the Magnitsky statute and our messages against the international human rights violators. I want to mention one other area where I think we can make tremendous progress during your tenure, and that is on anti- corruption. We have all acknowledged that corruption is a national security threat. Corruption exists in every country, but unless you have a plan to deal with corruption, it becomes very corrosive to the underlying fabric of any democratic society. So I have introduced legislation with Senator Young that would use the model of the trafficking in persons that we do, where we evaluate every country in the world, including the United States, as to how well they are dealing with ridding trafficking of humans. We set up a similar regime for corruption, where we identify the problems we have in countries with corruption and put them on a tier rating with consequences. I have talked to the--to the Biden transition team about this. This is legislation that did pass our committee and pass the Senate in the last Congress. It was not enacted into law. Will you work with us so that we can have a very strong position in making it clear that every country can do better with fighting corruption, that there are certain standards that need to be met? Mr. Blinken. Yes, absolutely. I welcome that if confirmed and, beyond that, we want to elevate the work in combating corruption at the State Department. That is something I would welcome talking to you about. Senator Cardin. Thank you. I want to cover, if I might, your strategies in regards to the U.S.-Israel relations. We know that there has been strong support for the special relationship between Israel and the United States. We know that we need to maintain America's leadership in regards to that relationship because Israel has been marginalized in so many places and so many organizations around the world. You already mentioned the Abraham Accords. How do you intend to try to get back on track the Israel-Palestinian negotiations, where we know the only way for lasting peace in the Middle East is two states living side by side in peace, a Jewish state and a Palestinian state? Mr. Blinken. Thank you, Senator. First, let me start with this very basic proposition, which is that our commitment to Israel's security is sacrosanct and this is something that the president-elect feels very strongly. His very first trip when he was a member of this committee as a senator--his first foreign trip was to Israel. He met with a prime minister by the name of Golda Meir. She had a young aide by the name of Yitzhak Rabin, and he has worked with every Israeli prime minister since then. And so the foundation of our relationship is support for Israel's security. Having said that, the president-elect believes and I share this conviction that the best way and maybe the only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish democratic state and to give the Palestinians the state to which they are entitled is through our other so-called two-state solution, obviously, a solution that is very challenged at this moment. I think, realistically, it is hard to see near-term prospects for moving forward on that. In the first instance, what would be important is to make sure that neither party takes steps that make the already difficult proposition even more challenging and, certainly, avoids unilateral actions that makes that more challenging and then, hopefully, to start working to slowly build some confidence on both sides that create an environment in which we might once again be able to help advance a solution to the Israel and Palestinian relationship. Senator Cardin. Thank you, and, of course, you have strong support in Congress, as you have seen by our actions, and I do think that with Congress working with the administration we should be able to advance the process. One last question dealing with Central America. You talked about corruption. Senator Biden, Vice President Biden, had a game plan to try to deal with the corruption in Central America in a way for good governance that provided opportunities that would help against the migration, people wanting to leave because of fear of gangs, et cetera. Is there a game plan for how we are going to deal with Central America? Mr. Blinken. There is, and I think, as you rightly point out, at the--at the end of the Obama/Biden administration, toward the end, then Vice President Biden worked very closely with Congress, with this committee, to develop a plan to deal with the challenges posed by the systemic and endemic problems in the Northern Triangle countries, in Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador, and these drivers, of course, were the primary drivers of the migration crisis that continues to challenge us to this very day. So getting at some of the root causes that are causing people to make that incredibly difficult decision to pick up one day, leave everything they know behind, leave their families, their country, their culture, their language behind because life is simply not tolerable in its present circumstance. If we do not help these countries address those causes, it is going to be very hard to get at the--at the root of the problem. And so there was a bipartisan plan put forward the past Congress with about $800 million to help countries in the Northern Triangle, but not simply throwing money at them but tying the assistance we were providing to concrete reforms that they would take in the criminal justice system, in combating corruption, in creating greater economic opportunity, et cetera. And we began to see some, I think, progress in each of those countries as a result of this assistance and coordination. Unfortunately, that plan went into abeyance in the last few years, and we will come forward to talk to you about a renewed effort at a bigger scale that involves assistance for the Northern Triangle countries but, again, assistance tied to concrete demonstrable reforms. Senator Cardin. Thank you very much. I appreciate it, and, again, thank you for your service. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cardin. Senator Romney? Senator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to be associated also with the comments you made at the opening of this session, also the comments Ranking Member Menendez as well as the questions which he asked, and I would like to indicate my concurrence also with the comments made by Mr. Blinken as he began. A number of things stood out. One was his conviction, which I share, that we be involved in the world because the world is a safer place if we are involved in the world, and I think something we sometimes lose in our discussion of this involvement is that that does not mean necessarily military engagement in the world. It means promoting our values, our economic interests, and so forth, and we are involved in the world because it is good for America. Not just good for the world, but it is good for us and for the people of America and I applaud that recognition. I want to begin with some thoughts about China and think for the committee as well as for the American public that is watching this if you would perhaps describe for us what China has described as their ambition over this century, what they intend to achieve and how the world would be different if they were successful in doing so. Mr. Blinken. Thank you very much, Senator. China had a policy for decades of, as they described it, hiding their hand and biding their time in terms of asserting their interests beyond China's borders, leaving aside what they were doing within their borders. And I think what we have seen in recent years, particularly since the rise of Xi Jinping as the leader, has been that the hiding and biding has gone away and they are much more assertive in making clear that they seek to become, in effect, the leading country in the world, the country that sets the norms, that sets the standards, and to put forward a model that they hope other countries and people will ascribe to. And, Senator, my own conviction is that there are many, many very apparent weaknesses that China continues to try to hide when it comes to projecting its model. But in the absence of an alternative, they may do better than we think. And so I think our obligation is to demonstrate that the vision that we have, the policies we pursue, and the way we do it is much more effective in actually delivering for our people as well as for people around the world, to make sure that our model is the one that carries the day. If we are pulling back from the world, if we are pulling back from the institutions, if we are pulling back from playing that lead role and shaping the rules and the norms, that gives them a free field to redefine the century more on their terms than on ours. One of the ways--this is just one example, but I think one of the ways we see this acutely is there is an increasing divide between what you might call techno democracies--that is, technologically sophisticated countries that are also democracies--and techno autocracies like China, and whether the techno democracies or the techno autocracies are the ones that get to define how technology is used, the technology that dominates all of our lives, I think, is going to go a long way towards shaping the next--the next decades. We have a very strong interest in making sure that the techno democracies come together more effectively so that we are the ones who are doing the shaping of those norms and rules, and to the extent technology can be infused with values that these are more our values than theirs. But there is no doubt that I think China would like to recapture its extraordinary past but to do so in a way that is, potentially and very practically, as we are seeing already, inimical to our own values and our own interests. Senator Romney. Yeah, I think--my own view is that their ambition is to become the geopolitical leader of the world as well as the economic leader of the world, the military leader of the world and, ultimately, to impose their authoritarian views in such a way that would put in great risk the freedom and liberty of people here and around the world. How does Taiwan and our commitments to Taiwan figure in your thinking with regards to our interests in the region? Mr. Blinken. There has been a strong and long bipartisan commitment to Taiwan, Taiwan Relations Act, also the communiques with China, and part of that commitment is making sure that Taiwan has the ability to defend itself against aggression, and that is a commitment that will absolutely endure in a Biden administration. We will make sure that Taiwan has the ability to do that. I would also like to see Taiwan playing a greater role around the world including in international organizations. When those organizations do not require the status of the country to be a member, they should become members. When it does, there are other ways that they can participate, and I think our own engagement with Taiwan should be looked at and, indeed, that is being done. As you know, some regulations were promulgated by the outgoing secretary of state. We are going to take a hard look at those pursuant to the Taiwan Assurance Act and we will--we will look at that. I had the opportunity, Senator, when President Tsai was running for office, to actually receive her as a candidate at the State Department when I was last there. I spoke to her a number of times when she became president and I was deputy secretary of state. But the commitment to Taiwan is something that we hold to very strongly. Senator Romney. India has, perhaps, begun to see China in a new light, not only because of the border dispute which led to the death of many Indian military individuals. They have indicated an openness to work with us with actually military preparations as well and war games. How can we strengthen our ties with India and strengthen their resolve to defend democratic interests in the region? Mr. Blinken. I think India has been very much a bipartisan success story over successive administrations. It started with toward the end of the Clinton administration after the nuclear tests when relations were put back on a better--a better footing. Under President Bush, we secured a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement with India. Then Senator Biden led the efforts at this committee to get that through Congress. And then I think during the Obama administration we deepened cooperation with India particularly in the defense procurement area, also on information sharing, and I think the Trump administration has carried that forward including with this concept of an Indo-Pacific and to make sure that we were working with India so that no country in the region, including China, could challenge its sovereignty and also working with it on concerns that we share about terrorism. So I think there are many ways in which we can deepen that cooperation to pursue the path that successive administrations have put us on. One area, I think, that has a lot of promise and maybe even necessity is actually climate. At the current rate things are going, India is poised over the next two or three decades to catch up to China in terms of emissions that it produces. At the same time, as you know, Prime Minister Modi has been a very strong advocate for looking at renewable energy and different technologies. I think there is a very strong potential for our countries to work together in that area. Senator Romney. Thank you. That does raise the question of what it is going to be like to serve in an administration where former Secretary Kerry is going to be working with you. I hope you are never tempted to give in in your strategy with regards to China in order to obtain a climate advantage that Secretary Kerry might be promoting. So your State Department commitment to confront China, I think, is a great--of great significance and, hopefully, the priority. Let me turn to another topic which was raised by Senator Johnson, appropriately, which is the number of accomplishments of the Trump administration shouldn't be lost and--in the foreign policy arena. One of those that is, perhaps, questionable by members in this committee relates to the JCPOA with regards to Iran. I, like Senator Menendez, was not supportive of the JCPOA and wrote a column suggesting that it was a mistake to enter into. My concern was that it allowed Iran to eventually have a nuclear weapon or have the capacity to have a nuclear weapon, and my view was that an agreement should only be reached if it prevented Iran forever from having a nuclear weapon. And I would only suggest that before the administration takes a posture with regards to the JCPOA that there be a very careful review of intelligence to determine just what the state is of Iran right now with regards to the health of its leaders, with regards to the fragility of its economy, because there may well be a potential to take a more aggressive stance than might have been anticipated and hope that you will give due consideration to not just reversing policies of the prior administration but, perhaps, taking advantage of some things done by the prior administration that may prevent an opportunity that we might otherwise not be able to recognize. Mr. Blinken. I welcome having the opportunity to do that, to plunge into the intelligence, if confirmed, and then also to working on that with you and other members of this committee. Senator Romney. Thank you, Mr. Blinken. The Chairman. Senator Shaheen? Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Blinken, thank you for being willing to consider being nominated to this important post at this critical time and for being here today. One of the things we have heard in the last few days is President-elect Biden's interest in resuming the United States' position in a number of international alliances from-- everything from the Paris Climate Accords to the WHO. But, clearly, it is going to take more than that to rebuild our relationships around the world. So what else do we need to do and what are you thinking about as--if you are confirmed that you think is going to be important to restoring those relationships? Mr. Blinken. Senator, I think we have a, and several members of the committee have already alluded to this, we do have a big task ahead of us in restoring, revitalizing those relationships. I do think it starts, to use a colloquial term, with showing up again, with being present, with having our diplomats engaged in the painstaking, sometimes not very glamorous hard work of day in day out diplomacy and being in the room, not pulling back from it. And I know sometimes that sounds trite but I just think that we are so much better off, even in institutions and organizations that are, clearly, imperfect and need reform, we are, as a general rule, much better off being at the table than being outside the room if we are going to try to influence those institutions and organizations and move them in a better direction. So I think you will see in a Biden administration that kind of engagement, that kind of leadership. I think it is also fair to say that some of our allies and partners question the sustainability of our commitments, based on the experience of recent years, and that is going to be a hard hill to climb and they are going to have to make their own calculations about that. But I think it comes down to this. One is, and maybe this is an obligation that I think all of us share who are in this line of work, part of our challenge, I think, is to connect what all of us are doing to the--to the lives of the American people, because if we want to have their support for American leadership and American engagement in the world, we have to demonstrate that it is actually making an improvement in their lives or preventing something bad from happening. And I think COVID-19, to some extent, has maybe brought that home as nothing else has in recent years, going back to 9/11. But there are so many other areas where what we are doing around the world connects directly to the lives that our fellow citizens are leading and I think we need to make those connections. That will give us a stronger foundation upon which to build an engaged foreign policy and, in turn, one that is, I think, sustainable and that our partners and allies recognize as such. Last word on this. I think one of the things that we all have in common with our democratic partners and allies is the recognition that most of the challenges we face, as I mentioned earlier, simply cannot be addressed effectively by any one country acting alone, even the United States. And so whether it is a global pandemic, whether it is a change in climate, whether it is the spread of bad weapons, you name it, all of these things demand international cooperation and coordination and I believe that if we are stepping up and playing the role that we played in the past but focused on the problems of today and tomorrow, we will actually get a receptive audience to work with us. Senator Shaheen. Well, I certainly agree with that and agree with the importance of robust diplomatic efforts, and given the discussion about China this afternoon, it seems to me that we ought to look at what China is doing in terms of their increase in investments and diplomacy, their opening consulates around the world, their focus on economic assistance for other countries, because right now they are eating our lunch and we better do better if we are going to be able to compete-- continue to compete. When you and I had the opportunity to talk a couple of weeks ago, which I very much appreciated, but one of the things we talked about were the attacks on our diplomatic personnel in Cuba and China and some other locations, and I and a number of other senators have continuously asked the State Department and Secretary Pompeo to provide information about those attacks, about what caused them, about our response to them to make sure that our personnel are all treated fairly, and we were able to get some language into the defense bill that passed this year to do that. But we still have not seen all of the information that is available. Will you commit to be transparent with us about what is going on with those attacks and getting to the bottom of who is responsible and sharing that information with Congress and with the public where it is appropriate? Mr. Blinken. Yes, absolutely. And, Senator, if I can just say, first, that your leadership on this issue and that of Senator Rubio I know has been deeply appreciated within the department. I had some opportunity to get briefed on a few issues during this transition and nomination period, and one of the ones I asked for immediately was to get everything we knew about the so-called Havana syndrome and these attacks. And so I have read the reports. I was briefed on it. I welcome an opportunity to come and, if confirmed, to talk to all of you about it. Priority is making sure that our diplomats are safe and secure but also that we find out who is responsible, if a state actor or others are responsible, having accountability and making sure that we put the protections in place so that our folks are safe and secure. I would welcome working with the committee on that. Senator Shaheen. Good. I hope, Senators Risch and Menendez, that we can make that happen with this committee in the next month or so. Another topic we talked about briefly was the importance of ensuring that women are part of our foreign policy agenda, and I am very proud to have worked on legislation to try and include women at the table when we are negotiating conflicts and to ensure that they are part of those efforts because the data shows us that when that is the case those kinds of peace negotiations have a 35 percent chance of lasting 15 years or longer. Thirty-five percent better chance of lasting 15 years or longer. So it is something that makes sense, and I would hope, again, that the State Department would take a more robust effort to be engaged in that. The Defense Department has, I think, been more proactive in that and I hope that State will join in those efforts in the coming year. But one of the areas where it is, clearly, an issue is in Afghanistan, and we have not gotten any commitment from the Taliban on the role of women in any future Afghan state post peace talks. So I wonder if you could talk about what you think we should be saying to the Taliban. Mr. Blinken. Well, first, Senator, I could not agree more with the larger points you were making and that is very much the lens that we would intend to put on our foreign policy and on the work with the State Department and, again, would welcome the opportunity to work with you on that. When it comes to Afghanistan, we have a real challenge there, to state the obvious. First, yes, we want to end this so-called forever war. We want to bring our forces home. We want to retain some capacity to deal with any resurgence of terrorism, which is what brought us there in the first place, and we have to look carefully at what has actually been negotiated--I haven't been privy to it yet--particularly with regard to the agreement that was reached in the first instance between the United States and the Taliban to understand fully what commitments were made or not made by the Taliban, and then to see where they get in their negotiations with the Government of Afghanistan. I do not believe that any outcome that they might achieve, the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, is sustainable without protecting the gains that have been made by women and girls in Afghanistan over the last 20 years when it comes to access to education, to health care, to employment. And so I think we have a strong interest if that agreement is actually--if there is an agreement if it is going to hold up to do what we can to make sure that those rights are preserved. But I would acknowledge to you that is--I do not think that is going to be easy. But we will work on it. Senator Shaheen. Yeah. No, I appreciate that and I intend to ask General Austin the same question at his hearing this afternoon. Can you, finally--I know I am almost out of time--but can you talk about what our response to Putin's taking into custody Mr. Navalny should be and how we continue to put pressure on Russia? Mr. Blinken. It is extraordinary how frightened Vladimir Putin seems to be of one man. I think that speaks volumes, and Mr. Navalny is a voice, I think, for millions and millions and millions of Russians and their voice needs to be heard in Russia, and the attempts to silence that voice by silencing Mr. Navalny is something that we strongly condemn and we have spoken to it and will continue to do so. I would say, more broadly, this is probably a subject for ongoing conversation. We have talked about a number of challenges, but the challenge posed by Russia across a whole series of fronts is also one that is urgent. I have to say that I think members of this committee, particularly Senator Romney, have been very prescient when it comes to the challenge posed to us by Russia. There is a lot to be discussed and talked about there. But this is very high on the agenda for an incoming administration. Senator Shaheen. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Shaheen. Senator Rubio? Senator Rubio. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Blinken, for being here. Thanks for your willingness to step back in and serve our country. Really should appreciate that for anyone who is willing to step up and do it. Obviously, everyone is asking about all the different parts of the world. I care about a lot of them so I am going to focus, if I can, on the Western Hemisphere for a moment--two specific things. The first is, as you are well aware, in Cuba there are very small, but not real large or substantial, small private businesses. The bulk of the economic activity in that country is controlled by a holding company named GAESA, which controls, basically, anything that makes money and they have actually-- any time they figure out something might make money they pull it into that. GAESA is controlled by the Cuban military and military officials, and the current administration, the Trump administration, put in place a policy that prohibits financial transactions with any of those companies that are controlled by that holding company owned by the Cuban military. And so, theoretically, if the Cuban Government would allow it, an independent Cuban can open up a restaurant, a hotel, or business and have transactions but not a company controlled by the Cuban military as identified through that holding company. Is that a policy that you would recommend to the Biden administration that we keep or not? Mr. Blinken. Senator, I would--I would propose to review that very, very quickly. In terms of the objectives that you cite, that makes very good sense to me. I think the question is, and I do not know enough to form a full judgment, is to whether it is, in fact, achieving those objectives and are there any other costs or consequences that we might want to look at. But certainly, the objective strikes me as exactly the right one. I would welcome an opportunity, if confirmed, to actually talk to you about that and, by the way, about our approach to Cuba, more broadly. Senator Rubio. On the issue of--as a matter of theory, because, obviously, the Cuban Government control--we can open up whatever we want to them but the Cuban Government controls what they allow and what they do not allow. So, as an example, if an individual Cuban decided to borrow money from a relative in the United States and open up a business, they get to do so under existing law, potentially, depending on how the transaction was structured. But the Cuban Government would not allow it. In fact, they would crack down on that. So I think we could agree, could we not, that to the extent that it involves economic independence for Cuban individuals or companies that they are allowed to start, that is one thing. But when it comes to these entities that are not state controlled entities, they are oligarchs that control it, basically, one individual, largely, because they want to be not just a politically totalitarian state but also an economic totalitarian state, that it would further the national interest to the United States to encourage more economic independence for the individual and less dependence on the state that gives them all this leverage over them. So I do sincerely hope that just because these were Trump policies, and I am not claiming that that is what you are saying, that we do not just throw the whole thing out and say, let us go back into the Obama policy that even some of the architects of it have since conceded could have been structured a little differently because they were unilateral and did not lead to some of the results we thought. I do think as you carefully review many of those steps that have been taken there was a logic and a rationale behind each of them that I hope you will--that will be taken into account. I think it serves our national interest to do so. On Venezuela, I am sure you are well aware that Maduro has repeatedly over the course of the last five to seven years utilized negotiations as a delay tactic. It is so egregious that even the Vatican says, we are not having any more negotiations. In fact, in a very strongly- worded letter from the Pope to him, said, do you remember the last time we met? I am paraphrasing. Remember the last time we met you agreed to things. You never did any of them. There is no purpose in meeting anymore. Effort after effort to negotiate with Maduro's regime for whatever have all resulted in nothing. He uses it to buy time and to delay, and he uses it to divide the opposition, and, unfortunately, multiple players have fallen into that trap. The reality of it is that he will agree to all sorts of short-term reversible things--you know, release a political prisoner, what have you. But at the end of the day, he is not ever going to agree to free and fair elections because he cannot win them. Is it your view that our stance towards Venezuela should change? In essence, that we should no longer recognize Juan Guaid cents and enter into negotiations with Maduro? Mr. Blinken. No, it is not. I very much agree with you. Senator, first of all, with regard to a number of the steps that were taken toward Venezuela in recent years, including recognizing Mr. Guaido, recognizing the National Assembly as the only democratically-elected institution in Venezuela, seeking to increase pressure on the regime led by a brutal dictator in Maduro, as well as to try to work with some of our allies and partners. The hard part is that for all of those efforts, which I support, we, obviously, have not gotten the results that we need and one of the things I would really welcome doing if confirmed is to come and talk some of that through with you and with others on this committee because we need an effective policy that can restore Venezuela to democracy, starting with free and fair elections, and how can we best advance that ball. I think there are some things that we can look at, particularly, better stronger coordination and cooperation with like-minded countries. Maybe we need to look at how we more effectively target the sanctions that we have so that regime enablers really feel the pain of those sanctions, and, certainly, I believe there is more that we need to try to do in terms of humanitarian assistance, given the tremendous suffering of the Venezuelan people, as well as helping some of the neighboring countries that have borne the brunt of refugees from Venezuela. But I would welcome an opportunity, if confirmed, to talk to you about that. Senator Rubio. I would just encourage that every time we talk about issues like Venezuela that it is important we point to the direct national interest of the United States in the matter because I think we--sometimes people start to get the imagery that this is about nation building or picking sides in an internal dispute. The reason why the U.S. cares about what is--we care about democracy. We care a lot about human rights. But there is a direct national interest to the United States involved. You have a regime that openly houses and gives safe harbor to multiple terrorist organizations like the FARC and the ELN that traffic drugs that, in turn, threaten to destabilize and even, potentially, topple at some point or seriously threaten the Government of Colombia, which would be a massive blow to regional stability and, ultimately, impacts us as well. It is already having a migratory pressure on this country but on countries in the region, in Peru and Brazil and Colombia which, ultimately, also impacts us. They have very friendly relations, military and otherwise, with the Russians and increased evidence of Iranian interest and activity including the sale of oil or gasoline in exchange for gold that they are stealing from their reserve. So I just encourage to constantly point to the fact that this is not just a do-gooder effort here. There is a direct national security interest to the United States involved in what happens there. You may have been asked this already but I think it is important. Would you acknowledge, as I think a growing number of people have, that there was once here a bipartisan consensus on China that once they got rich and they got prosperous they would become more like us.Mr. Blinken. Yes. Senator Rubio. That consensus was flawed? Mr. Blinken. I think we found that out in practice. Yes, I think there was a broad consensus that economic liberalization in China would lead to political liberalization. That has not happened. Senator Rubio. Beyond the political liberalization, their intent was never--it goes deeper, that it goes to a dangerous imbalance it has now developed in the relationship on a commercial front, on--and on a geopolitical front and, increasingly, potentially, on a military front. You have seen a massive expansion on military capability both technological and particularly in the asymmetric abilities that they have that really have no precedent, and it is now clear that they are making the argument to the world and, frankly and unfortunately, we, domestically, have helped to make this argument, that American style democracy is too chaotic and that what we have here, them, the Communist Party of China, is much more stable and a much better model to follow. The bottom line is, and I know that this is a--you know, people like to throw around phrases like cold war. I think this is very different than the Cold War. But do you have any doubt in your mind that the goal of the Chinese Communist Party is to be the world's predominant political--a geopolitical, military, and economic power and for the United States to decline in relation? Mr. Blinken. I do not. Senator Rubio. You have no doubt? Mr. Blinken. I have no doubt. Senator Rubio. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Rubio. I am told that Senator Coons is with us electronically. Is that true? Senator Coons. That is correct, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me? The Chairman. I can hear you. I cannot see you. Oh, now I can see you. There you are. Welcome, Senator Coons. The floor is yours. Senator Coons. Thank you, Chairman Risch, Ranking Member Menendez. Thank you so much for a chance to be with you. Tony, it is great to be with you again. Thank you to you and your family, to Evan and John and Lila, for your willingness to serve once again. Given your previous experience as deputy secretary of state, deputy national security advisor, as the staff director of this important committee, you have excellent experience and credentials, and in your opening statement you, once again, reinforced the ways in which your life experience, your values, reinforce all the ways in which you will be an excellent secretary of the state--secretary of state for this nation. I am sorry not to be with you in person. I was here for the send-off celebration as the president-elect departed Delaware and headed towards Washington to begin the inauguration. But it has been exciting to me to have a chance to hear my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, raise challenging issues and to hear your engaged and thoughtful and forward- looking answers. We gather today at a moment when it is a real challenge for all of us that the events of last Wednesday highlighted some of the deep divisions in our country and some of the challenges our democracy faces, and I am hopeful that after a national day of service yesterday celebrating Martin Luther King Day, after this evening's national reflection on all the American lives that have been lost in this COVID pandemic, and after tomorrow's inauguration, that we can begin the work of investing in our democracy, rebuilding our bipartisan consensus around some of the challenges facing us in the world and to do that in partnership with you. Let me, first, start with something that has been the topic of many questions from colleagues, the U.S.-China relationship and how that in many ways will define this century. I very much look forward to working with the incoming chairman and ranking member of this committee, with you, Mr. Blinken, and with many of my colleagues and figuring out how we craft a durable, a sustainable, and effective and a bipartisan strategy with regards to China. You have made reference, Tony, to the techno democracies and techno autocracies of the world and the ways in which there is an intersection between concerns about digital privacy, a digital promotion of democracy, intellectual property, and ways in which China's bad behavior on the world stage with regards to IP is laying the groundwork for them to successfully export their model of digital authoritarianism. Do you think in confronting China's digital authoritarianism we should make that a part of the agenda of our convening a global group of digital democracies, something like the D-10 that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has proposed, or do you think we should pursue something with more weight, a regional structure like a digital free trade zone of democracies aligned like the United States in order to help keep emerging technologies free and available and open to the world? Mr. Blinken. So my sense is everything should be on the table. It may be something that requires multiple steps to get to the destination in the first instance, bringing concerned countries together--the digital democracies together. An appropriate forum, I think, is the place to start. And I do not want to minimize the job. We, obviously, have disagreements among democracies about a lot of profound questions about how technology is used. So we have got some work to do just to get our own collective house in order. But I think you start there and then some of the more expansive ideas, Senator that you alluded to is something that we might be able to get to and work toward. Senator Coons. I would be excited to do that work with you. Senator Menendez, Senator Risch, a number of colleagues raised concerns about Iran and Iran's aggressive pursuit both regionally of influence of their ballistic missile program and of their restarting their more robust enrichment program and the threat that that poses to the region and to our security. I also just want to renew my commitment to the U.S.-Israel relationship and to trying to pursue some positive path towards a two-state solution. The Middle East as a region remains as unsettled and unstable as it has ever been. Although there was progress in some of the normalization aspects of the Abraham Accords that you have recognized, the administration will face real challenges in assessing Iran's willingness to negotiate in good faith and the path forward. I look forward to working with you on this challenge and making sure that we build a framework with our core allies in Europe that can take into account these broader destabilizing actions by Iran. Let me ask, quickly, about two other things going on in the region that haven't been addressed so far. Recently, outgoing Secretary Pompeo designated the Houthi movement in Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization. Many humanitarian leaders including the head of the World Food Program and senators on both sides of the aisle denounced that designation as something that may well create now a humanitarian crisis of greater scale. The president-elect has said he would end U.S. support for the war in Yemen and that U.S. support for humanitarian relief is critical. What steps do you think we can or should immediately take with regards to Yemen? How can the Senate help and how do you see this as a piece of that broader regional puzzle of working through, pushing back on Iran's projection of force through proxies while still reexamining some of our relationships in the region that have become more complicated by their human rights records? Mr. Blinken. First, Senator, we need to be clear eyed about the Houthis. They overthrew a Government in Yemen. They engaged in a path of aggression through the country. They directed aggression toward Saudi Arabia. They have committed atrocities and human rights abuses, and that is a fact. What is also a fact, though, is that the Saudi-led-- [Technical issue.] Mr. Blinken.--in Yemen--[Technical issue.] Mr. Blinken.--Houthi aggression has contributed to what is by most accounts the worst humanitarian situation that we face anywhere in the world, and one aspect of that situation is that about 80 percent of the Yemeni population right now is in areas controlled by the Houthis. And whether we like it or not, we have to find ways to get assistance to them if we are going to do anything about addressing this situation. And so my concern, deep concern, about the designation that was made is that, at least on its surface, it seems to achieve nothing particularly practical in advancing the efforts against the Houthis and to bring them back to the negotiating table while making it even more difficult than it already is to provide humanitarian assistance to people who desperately need it. So I think we would propose to review that immediately to make sure that what we are doing is not impeding the provision of humanitarian assistance even under these difficult circumstances. I recognize that some have talked about carve outs for American providers of humanitarian assistance. The problem there is that if the carve outs do not apply to everyone around the world, it is not going to get the job done because most of the humanitarian assistance provided to Yemen is not coming from the United States. It is coming from other countries. So I think we have got a very specific and concrete problem that we need to address very quickly if we are going to make sure we are doing everything we can to alleviate the suffering of people in Yemen. Senator Coons. Thank you for that answer. I need to move forward, given the limitations of time. I was proud to have a chance to work with a number of colleagues on this committee in 2018 to help pass the BUILD Act that created the new Development Finance Corporation, in 2019 the Global Fragility Act, which set a new process and framework for looking at fragile states, borrowing from the lessons of Plan Colombia. One of the areas, as we both know, the president-elect has been passionate about is the Northern Triangle and finding ways to build a sustained long-term strategy--[Technical issue.] Senator Coons.--secure stability in a region that has long known fragility. And at the end of last year, we passed a bipartisan package that creates the Nita Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Fund to provide support for a partnership between Palestinians and Israelis to provide for economic ventures and opportunity. Are these three tools that you look forward to working with us on and that you will embrace in your leadership role as the Biden administration looks for new tools to use in advancing our broader objective? Mr. Blinken. Yes. Senator Coons. And can you help me understand how you view the challenge of combating fragility and putting prioritization in place between diplomacy, defense, and development? Mr. Blinken. So first thing, I think the Fragility Act is a terrific foundation upon which to do this. I have had some conversations with the president-elect about exactly this and it is very much on his mind, that is, the risks that continue to be posed emanating from fragile states and the national security interests that we have as well as--[Technical issue.] Mr. Blinken.--what we can to help strengthen fragile states and prevent fragile states from becoming failed states. And I think you put in place a very good foundation for thinking about that and, of course, part of this is making sure that our development programs are fully and thoroughly integrated into our foreign policy, making sure that they are delivering and effective because we are conscious that we are using the taxpayers' money in advancing them but also making sure that we put these front and center, that they are not an afterthought. They are actually the first thought, along with our diplomacy in our foreign policy. Senator Coons. Thank you, and I think the Development Finance Corporation provides a critical new tool as long as it is a development finance corporation. Let me just--a number of colleagues have referenced Russia and the tragic arrest of Navalny and the importance of advancing human rights and supporting the fight for democracy, whether it is in failed authoritarian states like Venezuela or it is in Putin's Russia or it is elsewhere in the world. You know my long concern for Africa. There was just a flawed--a deeply flawed election in Uganda where Museveni has again held on to power in no small part by engaging in a blatant disregard for human rights. There are other countries of real concern in Ethiopia, the violence in the Tigray region, in Sudan, on the other hand, where there has been a encouraging transition to democracy recently. How do you plan to better support the fragile transition in Sudan while pushing back on those countries that are backsliding on their commitment to democracy like Uganda or, as some would argue, Ethiopia? Mr. Blinken. So I think it starts with our very active engagement, not being AWOL from the problems that emerged in Ethiopia. I share your deep concerns. We have seen a number of deeply, deeply concerning actions taken including atrocities directed both at people in Tigray, directed at Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia. We, I think, need to see much greater access to the region, accountability, an effort to put a dialogue in place so that the issues that cause the conflict can actually be discussed and litigated as opposed to dealt with through violence. We need to see restoration of communications. We need access for humanitarian assistance in the region, and I worry as well that what started there has the potential to be destabilizing throughout the Horn of Africa. So I would like to see American diplomacy fully engaged in trying to contend with this--with this challenge. You cited a number of other places where we have--I share your concerns about the elections in Uganda, concerns in Cameroon recently, particularly violence directed at the Anglophone population. So there are a whole series of places where we have challenges where, I think, the United States can help make a difference and that starts with being engaged. Senator Coons. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your indulgence. If I can just, in closing, say I share your commitment to a diverse workforce in the State Department and to ensuring that the State Department has the resources it needs to do its job well. I could not agree more, Tony, with your statement that we have to connect foreign policy to the lived daily concerns of average working people across this country. You will be an excellent leader in doing so and I very much look forward to supporting your nomination and to working with you. Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Coons. Next up is Senator Graham, and after that will be Senator Murphy. However, between the two and after Senator Graham we are going to take a humanitarian break for about 10 minutes, since we have been at it for a couple of hours. So you are holding up well, Mr. Blinken, but we do not--we do not want you to wither. So we will take a break after Senator Graham's--his usual poignant questions. Senator Graham? Senator Graham. Thank you. I will try to make sure that I do not violate the Geneva Convention here. The one thing I want to say is I think you are an outstanding choice by President-elect Biden. I have known you for a long time and I think you are loyal to the president and I think you understand the world. We have different viewpoints on certain issues, but to me, the whole point of this is to nominate qualified people, get them in place as quickly as possible, reach agreement where you can and disagree when you must. So Senator Coons and I are going to be working together on the State Department appropriations account. You have my complete support. The people at the State Department are incredibly patriotic. They live in dangerous places doing very dangerous things. They do not get the notoriety they deserve. So I am just a big fan of soft power in foreign policy. The military has a very limited ability to change things and they know it more than anybody else. So I think you are an outstanding choice. I intend to vote for you but we are going to quickly go around the world and try to get a 30,000-foot view of where we--where we start this new administration. Do you still consider Iran the largest state sponsor of terrorism? Mr. Blinken. I do. Senator Graham. Okay. Do you consider Israel a racist nation? Mr. Blinken. No, I do not. Senator Graham. Okay. That is a good start. Afghanistan. Do you agree that what--I agree totally with Senator Shaheen that if we abandon the Afghan women, who fought so hard to have a say about the future of their children, it will affect our children's future. Do you agree with that? Mr. Blinken. I do. Senator Graham. If we have learned anything from Afghanistan, taking your eye off the ball does not really work well, and having 100,000 troops over there and spending trillions of dollars really does not work well, either. We are down to 2,500, a residual force with a counterterrorism mission. Do you think that is responsible at this point? Mr. Blinken. I know the president-elect wants to make sure that even as we pull back our forces that we retain the capacity to deal with any reemerging-- Senator Graham. And anything would be conditions based? Mr. Blinken. That is correct. Senator Graham. Do you trust the Taliban to police al-Qaeda and ISIS regarding attacking Americans? Mr. Blinken. Trust is not a word that I would apply. Senator Graham. Yeah. No, that is right. I agree with you. So any agreement that trusts the Taliban to police al-Qaeda and ISIS without us having some say, I think, would be a bad deal. I appreciate that very much. On immigration, you are soon going to be secretary of state with, hopefully, a good bipartisan vote. I think you deserve it. What would you tell the people in a caravan coming toward America? Mr. Blinken. I would say do not--do not come. Senator Graham. Yeah, I think that is a good message. We are going to work on comprehensive immigration reform. I will try to help where I can. But just do not come. That creates more problems than it solves. When it comes to asylum, asylum seekers have been staying in Mexico under the Trump administration. Do you find value in that program? Mr. Blinken. I have issues with that program, Senator. I think that we need to make sure that we are approaching what we do when it comes to those seeking asylum, seeking protection, in this country in line with the finest traditions that this country has shown from generation to generation. Part of that is the ability that is both, I believe, a legal one and a moral one, from where I sit, to allow people to make asylum claims and to deal with those claims expeditiously. People who need protection should get it. Those who do not meet the criteria should, with dignity, be removed. But our problem is that we are not resourced adequately to do this, and that is what we need to work on. Senator Graham. I could go a bit further. I think it has been gamed. I mean, I would like to increase the number of people that come here seeking asylum. There are troubled parts of the world. A lot of people come here for economic reasons. They realize that if they get one foot in the United States and claim asylum, they will be given a hearing date in the future and most of them do not show up. Do you think we need to make sure that that narrative does not restart? Mr. Blinken. I agree, and we need a humane, a fair, and an orderly system. That is imperative. And I know you heard the president-elect talk about the-- Senator Graham. Some people on the left have been saying that we should decriminalize entry into the country. Do you agree with that? Mr. Blinken. Not my jurisdiction, but I disagree. Senator Graham. Okay. All right. China. Secretary Pompeo designated the Chinese Communist Party as having engaged in genocide regarding the Uighur Muslim population. Do you agree with that designation? Mr. Blinken. That would be my judgment as well. Senator Graham. You do agree? Mr. Blinken. Yes. Senator Graham. We are on a good start here. [Laughter.] Senator Graham. So this--really, I just very much appreciate that. Do you believe that the Chinese Communist Party misled the world about the coronavirus? Mr. Blinken. I do. Senator Graham. What price, if any, should they pay? Mr. Blinken. When it comes to China's role in the virus, I think we already--we want a--there is a, as you know, an investigation-- Senator Graham. Yeah. Mr. Blinken [continuing]. That is ongoing. We, obviously, want to see the results of that investigation. But there are some things we already know. Senator Graham. If they do not cooperate, what should we do? Mr. Blinken. That we have to look at very hard because that cooperation--this is really the point, I think, of where we need to go on this. What we do know already with regard to China and the virus is that they did not provide transparency. They did not share information. They did not give access when it mattered most in the early days of this virus. Had they done so, it is possible that the course of the virus would have been different and we could have dealt with it sooner and more effectively. My sense, Senator, going forward is that what we should be focusing on--I know people talk about the punitive. I would be very focused on the preventative, which is to say---- Senator Graham. Sure. Mr. Blinken [continuing]. What steps will China take, going forward. Senator Graham. Sure, like wet markets. Right. Mr. Blinken. For example, yes, a very good example. Senator Graham. Yeah. I agree with that. When it comes to Taiwan, it has been the policy of the United States to, basically, for lack of a better term, to guarantee Taiwanese democracy. What is your view of that? Mr. Blinken. My view is we have an abiding and long- standing and bipartisan commitment to Taiwan and to the Taiwan Relations Act. We need to make sure that they have the means to deter aggression, to defend themselves. I would like to see them, Taiwan, even more engaged in the world. It is, in many ways, a model democracy, a strong economy, and a technological powerhouse, and of course, the way they have dealt with COVID-19 has a lot of lessons to teach us. Senator Graham. But if the Chinese Communist Party decided to use military force against the population in Taiwan, that would create great upheaval throughout the world and they would pay a heavy price. Is that fair to say? Mr. Blinken. That would be a grievous mistake on their part. Senator Graham. Hong Kong. Seems to be that they are not really paying much attention to what Congress is doing and what this administration is doing regarding Hong Kong. What can we do to get their attention that we are not doing? Mr. Blinken. So I wish we had taken some steps earlier. The national security law, the crackdown on media, the crackdown on free speech, on assembly--all of that has, I think, put in tatters the notion of real freedom and autonomy in Hong Kong, which were guarantees in the handover. One of the things--this is not going to fix the problem, but I would like see us, for example, be able to take in some of those fleeing Hong Kong and fleeing the repression, for standing up for their democratic rights, and I know there is some legislation that looks at doing that. But I think we have to take a hard look about what our position should be on the presence of institutions and companies there. Is it going to remain a hub and a financial center? Does Beijing then get both sides of the benefit? We should take a hard look at that. Senator Graham. I think the first thing we have to do is send a stronger message, because they are, clearly, not listening to this Congress. And this administration's efforts, which I applaud, have fallen short and it is very difficult. When it comes to Turkey, the Congress has been pretty tough on Turkey for continuing to purchase Russian weapons and the S- 400. Do you believe that Turkey needs to continue to be sanctioned until they change their behavior? Mr. Blinken. So I have looked at some of the so-called CAATSA sanctions. I think that what Turkey has done as a NATO ally in acquiring the S-400s is unacceptable. The idea that a strategic--so-called strategic partner of ours would actually be in line with one of our biggest strategic competitors in Russia is not acceptable. I think we need to take a look and see the impact that the existing sanctions have had and then determine whether there is more that needs to be done. Senator Graham. Okay. I think this administration may have yesterday, I do not know, lifted a travel ban from Europe and other areas with a high COVID-19 infection rate. Are you considering restoring that ban? Mr. Blinken. So right now that is---- Senator Graham. I would encourage you to. Mr. Blinken [continuing]. That is--it is above my pay grade. So---- Senator Graham. I would encourage you to. The reasons--you know, the caravans have multiple level problems and it would be odd to just keep a travel ban in Europe but, you know, allow people to mass on our border. So I hope we do not--I hope we, you know, continue to fight the illness and prevent transmission. Finally, so many people wonder where our biggest threat is. I am going to just end with this thought. China is a problem--multiple layer problem. Russia is up to no good. There is two groups out there that I worry the most about. I think if the Iranians had a nuclear weapon they would use it. I think the ayatollah is a religious Nazi. Will you agree to at least talk to me and Senator Menendez about an alternative to the JCPOA when it comes to Iran? Mr. Blinken. I welcome talking to both of you and members of this committee about the way forward on Iran. Senator Graham. Okay. And, finally, this is the 20th anniversary of 9/11. September this year will be 20 years. I think they are going to remind us that they are still out there. Do you agree with me that the worst thing that America could do is have a false sense of security when it comes to radical Islam? Do you agree with the following proposition, the only reason they haven't killed more of us is they cannot find a way to do it and we have pretty much kept our foot on their throat? Mr. Blinken. I share your concerns about the ongoing threat posed by what is left of al-Qaeda, ISIS, other extremist groups that target the United States. Senator Graham. Finally, do you believe if they had a nuclear or chemical weapon, if they could acquire one, they would use it? Mr. Blinken. I think that is a--there is a high probability that if they had access to such a weapon, certainly, in the past they would have and, going forward, something to be concerned about. Senator Graham. Twenty years later, where do we stand regarding the fight against al-Qaeda and ISIS? Mr. Blinken. I think we have demonstrably made significant progress in different parts of the world against them when it comes to al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, the original threat. They are still a problem. They are still a presence. They are still a relationship with the Taliban. It is much diminished from what it was. But precisely to your point, if we take our eye off that ball there is a risk that it comes back. ISIS, I think, actually across two administrations we succeeded in taking away its geographic caliphate in Iraq and in Syria. But there, again, we cannot take our eye off the ball and, of course, we have seen affiliates of both groups spread to different parts of the world. So we still have our work cut out for us. Senator Graham. Thank you. I look forward to working with you. Thank you. The Chairman. I think all of us agree with those comments and, particularly, right now for whatever reason, the Sahel seems to be their preferred place to reemerge. So that is something that is going to need your attention. With that, Senator Murphy, you have been incredibly patient from the very beginning but I am going to ask you to be patient for a little longer, and we will take a 10-minute humanitarian break. The committee will be at ease subject to the call of the chair. [Recess.] The Chairman. The committee will come to order. Senator Murphy, you are up. Senator Murphy. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good to see you, Tony. Thank you for sharing that really wonderful story about your stepfather out the outset. You know, we are not a perfect nation. We have been flawed from the beginning. We are always seeking perfection. But I imagine at that moment America looked perfect and it is a reminder of the unique power that this country has to effect change and be a force for good in the world. Thanks for beginning us with that inspirational story. I wanted to come back to this question of the war in Yemen for a moment. I thank Senator Coons for beginning this conversation. It has been just a national security disaster for the United States. Over a hundred thousand children have died of starvation and disease. AQAP, to Senator Graham's point, may be the arm of al-Qaeda with the clearest intentions to hit the United States, remains active, controlling territory and, I would argue, has strengthened Iran the longer that it has gone on. President-elect Biden made a commitment during the campaign to end our military support for the Saudi-led coalition and I wanted to ask you to speak to that commitment but then also maybe to step back and talk about what this--what our work through this coalition has taught us about the path forward in our relationship with Saudi Arabia. This is an important ally, a strategic partner, but one that has begun to act very differently and Yemen is an example of a set of behaviors that has gone off the rails in many ways and probably argues for us to take a different approach to an ally but an ally whose interests often do not align with ours any longer. So the specific question of military support for the coalition and then a broader look at the alliance. Mr. Blinken. Thank you very much, Senator. The president-elect had made clear that we will end our support for the military campaign led by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, and I think we will work on that in very short order once the president-elect is president for the reasons that you have cited. We have seen Yemen become the worst humanitarian situation in the world and, of course, as we were discussing earlier, the Houthis bear significant responsibility for what has happened in Yemen. But the way the campaign has been conducted has also contributed significantly to that situation and so our support should end. We, of course, as you cited, have a partnership with Saudi Arabia. We, I believe, should do what we need to do to help defend Saudi Arabia against aggression directed at Saudi Arabia including from Yemen and from the Houthis. But, again, as you have said, we have real concerns about some of the policies that our Saudi partners have pursued and, accordingly, the president-elect has said that we will review the entirety of the relationship to make sure that as it stands it is advancing the interests and is respectful of the values that we bring to that partnership. Senator Murphy. You made, I think, an interesting and, I think, very candid comment in response to Senator Johnson's query about Libya, that we were met with realities on the ground that we did not expect. You could probably tell a very similar story about our engagements in most Middle Eastern theaters of war, that we had a plan and then once we got on the ground that plan was met with realities that we did not expect, whether it is the ability of Iran and al-Qaeda to fill vacuums in Iraq, the difficulty of finding moderate vetted rebels in Syria to train. They could be effective in pushing back against Bashar al- Assad, and I think there is probably a lot of reasons for the series of mistakes we have made. Hubris is probably one of them, and so I appreciate your comment about humility. But I also think it is due to the--I think a secondary role that State has played often in many of these strategic conversations over the years because of a lack of capacity that State has. In Syria, when we put 2,000 troops on the ground we had, at time, only one diplomat, one State Department personnel, there even though every single general came before us and told us that there was no military solution inside Saudi Arabia--inside Syria. And so this leads me to two connected questions. One, what are the capacities that State does not have today that it needs to be able to compete? If the threats that are posed to the United States in the next 50 years are by and large not conventional military threats, what does State need to be able to respond? And second, especially in these really dangerous fragile places how do we get the State Department out of its bunker? Especially in the wake of Benghazi, the walls have gone up, and so 18-year-old Marines are out doing the work of diplomats. So what kind of capacities do we need? How do we get State out on the front lines? Mr. Blinken. I really appreciate the question. I think it goes to the heart of the mission I would have responsibility for if I am confirmed to this job. First, in terms of State capacity, in the first instance, we have, as a result of attrition, as a result of morale, we have seen a drop off in the State personnel where we are about--now about a thousand short of the numbers we were at just four years ago. That in and of itself is a problem. But it is not simply a matter of bringing people back, filling the slots that are now empty. It is making sure that to the best of our ability we are building a workforce that has a skill set to deal with the incredibly complex challenges that we are facing that are very different than the challenges we faced in previous generations. We have some authority. I suggest we probably need more that give us the flexibility to bring talent in in different ways at different times to meet some of those needs. We need to have the expertise in global health. We need to have the expertise in climate. We need to have the expertise in technology, given the dominant role that it plays and that is something that, if confirmed into this job, I am going to spend some real time on and working with this committee to make sure that we have the ability to do that. Part of this is about spreading the message that this is a wonderful career to have and a good place to be. I have been distressed by the fact that applications to take the Foreign Service exam dropped significantly. So that is something we need to repair. And then, finally, on this point, Senator--we talked about this a little bit earlier--the skill set, the talent set, that is usually important. But the workforce also has to look like the country it purports to represent, and so one of the things that I am determined to focus on, if confirmed, is on making good on building that kind of workforce, making sure that we are recruiting, we are retaining, and we are accountable for a workforce at State that looks more like the country it represents. And I think there is a lot of things that we can do to achieve that and make real progress. Senator Murphy. I think you are right, this is about capabilities. I do think it is also just about a finite number of resources. It does not make sense to me, given the threats presented in the United States today that we have more military band members than we do diplomats, and we have to watch what China is doing. 2019 was the first year in which they had more diplomatic posts around the world than the United States did. If we are going to meet them on a playing field even strength then we need to reconcile---- Mr. Blinken. Like I said, I very much agree with that and my colleagues will probably take this out on me for saying it, but when I look at the fact that the last requested increase for the Defense Department, the increase over its existing budget, equaled the totality---- Senator Murphy. Right. Mr. Blinken [continuing]. Of the State foreign operations budget, I think something is out of whack. Senator Murphy. In the minute I have remaining, I would love to turn to a subject we haven't touched upon and that is Ukraine. Obviously, the subject of much consternation and discussion in the United States Congress over the last two years, but a country that is still enormously fragile and a country that is in need of a much more stable friendship from the United States. The focus here has been, largely, around this question of lethal arms. I came around to support that notion. At the same time, I do not think Putin has any intention of actually marching an army to Kiev. He wants to disempower that nation economically and politically so that eventually they just give up and hand the keys back to a Kremlin-friendly government. And so it is really a question of can we give them the political tools and the economic health in order to stay sovereign and independent, and I would love your quick thoughts on the path forward with Ukraine. Mr. Blinken. I spent a lot of time on Ukraine when I was last in government. I share your--both your commitment to trying to help it, particularly to stand up against the aggression that we have seen from Russia, both with regard to the attempted annexation of Crimea and, of course, what is happening--the conflict in the Donbas in eastern Ukraine. And I very much agree with you that we have to have a comprehensive approach. I supported the provision of lethal defensive assistance to Ukraine. But to the extent that Russia is the threat from without, the threat from within is corruption. The threat from within is a lack of institutions that can effectively manage the country, and we have to help the Ukrainians deal with that, too, because even if we are successful in at least keeping--helping them keep Russia at bay, if that threat from within continues then it is going to be very difficult for them to build a viable democracy. Senator Murphy. Thank you for your candid conversation with us today. Notwithstanding all of that agreement with Lindsey Graham earlier, I look forward to supporting your nomination. Thank you, Tony. Mr. Blinken. Thank you, Senator. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Murphy. I think with that, we will move to Senator Barrasso. Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Blinken, I appreciate your being here today to testify. We all value your willingness to serve the country. The role of the secretary of state is vitally important to protecting our national security as well as advancing American interests and our values across the globe. With this in mind, your nomination to me raises concerns. It is critically important our nation not return to a strategy of leading from behind. Many of us have spoken about the failed foreign policies of the Obama/Biden administration. Robert Gates, the former secretary of defense under President Obama, noted that Joe Biden, he said, quote, ``has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.'' And I bring this up because you were an integral part in advising both Biden and Obama on these failed foreign policy decisions. Even with years of experience in foreign policy, when it came time to make the right decisions, in your own words you say you failed. On Syria, the Obama/Biden foreign policy failed. You admitted, quote, ``We failed in preventing a tragic loss of life as well as millions of people made into refugees or internally displaced, and that is something that we will have to live with.'' You also went on to say, ``In Syria, we rightly sought to avoid another Iraq by not doing too much, but we made the opposite error of doing too little.'' On Libya, the Obama/Biden foreign policy failed. Again, you admit it. You said, ``Libya is a particularly challenging one and I have to acknowledge that we, obviously, did not succeed in the Obama/Biden administration and getting that right.'' In Iraq, the Obama/Biden foreign policy failed. Unfortunately, you continue, I believe, to mistakenly call the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq a success. But the rest of the world knows that the failure to get a status of force agreements in Iraq created a vacuum, which led to the rise and creation of ISIS. In 2014, Senator John McCain, who was a member of this committee, raised these issues. Went to the Senate floor to speak against your nomination to be deputy secretary of state. I ask, Mr. Chairman, that his statement be submitted to the record. The Chairman. Without objection. [The information referred to in located at the end of this transcript.] Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. He raised concerns with your actions, statements, and decisions regarding Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Ukraine based on that record of failed foreign policy decisions. Senator McCain said, ``Not only is Mr. Blinken unqualified but he is,'' he said, ``I believe a threat to the traditional interests and values that embody the United States of America.'' So once you were confirmed, what happened? You helped negotiate the terrible Iran nuclear deal. These botched decisions have serious consequences. I believe they embolden terrorist organizations around the globe. These failures put the lives of the men and women who serve our nation at risk and I think it would be a grave mistake to confirm a secretary of state who has a demonstrated track record of repeatedly making the wrong decisions when it comes to American foreign policy and national security. In your opening statement, you talked about the Chinese Communist Party, who continues to commit terrible human rights abuses. I want to talk about that. You have confirmed that you believe it is genocide that the Uighurs, a religious and ethnic minority in China, has experienced, as you know, brutal repression at the hands of the Chinese Government. What do you plan to do with the first--within the first 30 days to address what Joe Biden has described as a genocide committed by the Chinese Government? Mr. Blinken. Thank you, Senator. I was tempted to start by saying it is good to see you again. [Laughter.] Mr. Blinken. So on the--on the Uighurs, I think we are very much in agreement, and the--forcing men, women, and children into concentration camps, trying to, in effect, reeducate them to be adherents to the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party, all of that speaks to an effort to commit genocide. And so I agree with that finding. I think we have to look at the tools that we have available to us including some of the tools that the Congress has provided to see what actions we can take. So, for example, I think we should be looking at making sure that we are not importing products that are made with forced labor from Xinjiang. That is one such thing. We need to make sure that we are also not exporting technologies and tools that could be used to further their repression. That is one place to start. Senator Barrasso. In your opening statement, and I agree with it, you said that strengthening Congress' traditional role with--in foreign policy would be helpful and the U.S. Constitution provides the Senate the power to approve or reject treaties. But treaties have to be submitted to Congress before we can approve them or reject them. So whether it is the Paris Climate Agreement or the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama/Biden administration disregarded the important role of the Senate. They refused to submit the agreements to the Senate for its advice and consent. So the Obama/Biden administration did an end run around us, attempted to draft them in a way to avoid the ratification process. So, if confirmed, is it going to be continuation to disregard the will of the American people by negotiating international agreements and then refusing to submit them to the Senate? Or will we go by what you said in your opening statement, which is more of a partnership? Mr. Blinken. I think two things. First of all, with regard to any of these issues, any of these agreements in whatever form they are, my strong commitment to you and to this committee is that we will engage in genuine consultations. Not notification, real consultations, real dialogue on the take- off, not on the landing so we can try to work these things through together. When it comes to various arms control agreements, there is a long history, as you know, of many agreements not being treaties. Whether it is the Nuclear Suppliers Group, whether it is the Proliferation Security Initiative, and then in other areas like the Helsinki Final Act, none of these were treaties. There are sometimes good reasons, in fact, reasons that advance our national security for why a treaty is not advisable. There is international treaty law that sometimes makes it more difficult to take action against a country that is not complying with its obligations under a treaty than it is under a nontreaty agreement. So I think we have to look at this on a case by case basis. With regard to Iran, of course, there is the INARA legislation. We will, certainly, make sure that we are in compliance with that legislation and its requirements. Many of the reporting requirements, of course, have fallen by the wayside once we got out of the agreement. At a minimum, those would--those would resume and we will have to look at what the obligations under the law would be if there is any forward movement with Iran. Senator Barrasso. You brought up the arms control agreement. As our country continues to face threats from around the world, we should not take any action, I believe, that is going to hinder our missile defense options. The United States must always remain in charge of our missile defense system, not Russia, not any other country. So I have concerns about efforts of Russia to limit our own missile defense and actions that the Obama administration took on this issue. So can you commit to us that in any arms control discussion with Russia for which you are responsible that the United States will never agree to any limiting of our own missile defense programs? Mr. Blinken. It is hard to see a circumstance in which we would do that. Senator Barrasso. So the New START expires February 5th, coming up, 2021---- Mr. Blinken. Right. Senator Barrasso [continuing]. In less than a month. There are only a few weeks before the arms reduction treaty between us ends. Does the Biden administration plan to extend the treaty and, if so, for how long? Mr. Blinken. Senator, I think we are going to seek an extension. I say I think because we have been very focused on observing one president at a time, a tradition and rule. And so this is something that the president-elect I know will have to take up almost immediately upon assuming office for the very reasons that you cited. We have an agreement that is expiring in just 16 days or so. So what I can tell you is that I know we will be coming to you very quickly, almost immediately, to discuss that and what I can say at this point is that yes, we will seek to extend it. Senator Barrasso. President-elect Biden has pledged to treat U.S. allies with respect and consideration. One of our most important allies is our neighbor to the north, Canada. Today, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged the incoming administration to consider any potential efforts to sabotage--to reconsider any potential efforts to sabotage the Keystone XL Pipeline. President-elect Biden has made comments or I understand from the news that he wants to shut that down. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney raised concerns about reports of plans to cancel this valuable project, saying, quote, ``Doing so would kill jobs on both sides of the border, would weaken the critically important Canada-U.S. relationship, would undermine U.S. national security by making the United States more dependent on OPEC oil imports in the future.'' So I strongly oppose any effort by the Biden administration to cancel or delay the Keystone XL Pipeline project. It creates jobs. It helps grow the economy. It improves our nation's energy security. I think taking action to cancel it would eliminate jobs for thousands of Americans and undermine economic stability for many. So how does revoking permits for the Keystone XL Pipeline without consultation or deliberation show respect and consideration to Canada, one of our closest allies? Mr. Blinken. So this would be a decision for the president to make. He has--the president-elect has said that he does intend to rescind the permit. What I can say with regard to the State Department and its role and my potential role if I am at the State Department is anything going forward we would address with absolute objectivity and professionalism to make sure that any proposed permit or agreement that comes before us advances the national interest and national security. Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Barrasso. Senator Kaine? Senator Kaine. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and to Mr. Blinken, congratulations on the nomination. You are very well qualified for the position. Let me begin with something that I think is really important. The secretary of state, by longstanding norm, not law, has been one of the least political of the Cabinet secretaries. Generally, the attorney general, secretary of state, secretary of Treasury, secretary of defense do not engage in partisan political activity, and that pretty much goes back decades and decades. Your successor pretty much broke that practice in some fairly significant ways. Your predecessor. Your predecessor has an office of legal advisor. The office of the legal advisor gave wise advice to all in State and elsewhere. In a December 2019 memo, the legal advisory reminded all political appointees that they were, quote - ``they were prohibited from'', quote, ``engaging in political activity in concert with a partisan candidate, political party, or partisan political group,'' and specifically indicated that, quote, ``Senate-confirmed presidential appointees may not even attend a political party convention or a convention-related event.'' Your predecessor stressed that in a cable to State Department employees in December: Quote, ``It is important that the department's employees do not improperly engage the Department of State in the political process and that they adhere to the Hatch Act and department policies in their own political activities.'' Despite that, your predecessor appeared and gave a campaign speech at the Republican National Convention, violating policy that he and the legal advisor had laid, clearly, down. I want to ask you about the words of another secretary of state, Colin Powell, who said, ``As secretary of state, I am obliged not to participate in any way, shape, fashion, or form in parochial political debates. I have to take no sides in the matter,'' he said in 2004 when he skipped the Republican National Convention. Will you follow the Powell practice that has been the practice of the State Department and the secretary of state for decades or will you follow the Pompeo practice and turn the secretary of state into a partisan political position? Mr. Blinken. I strongly agree with Secretary Powell and that is the model I would follow. Senator Kaine. That is--I will be extremely disappointed if I see you showing up at partisan events for Democrats, including the president and vice president, the president who has appointed you. If I see you doing campaign events for anybody on my side of the aisle, I will be very disappointed. I know you are not going to, but I wanted to put that on the record. Mr. Blinken. And I would welcome you holding me to that. I have to tell you, Senator, I could not agree more strongly that with regard to the State Department, it has to be and if I have anything to say about it, it will be a nonpartisan institution that is seeking only to advance the national interest. And I might add, I have had--I started my career in Washington at the department in 1993, and I have been working with the men and women of the Foreign Service, the civil service, for the better part of 25 years. And I could not begin to tell you for nine out of 10 and maybe even 10 of 10 if the person is a Republican, a Democrat, an Independent, or what. They are simply professionals who are working to advance the national interest, and if the person who purports to lead them is not doing the same thing I think we have got a problem. Senator Kaine. Let me ask a related question. The norm, over time, in the State Department for ambassadors has been that about 70 percent are career and 30 percent are political. There is nothing magic about that number. But administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have generally sort of adhered to that ratio. The Trump administration changed that ratio pretty significantly. It was about 55 percent career and 45 percent political, 50 percent higher in terms of the political appointees than the norm. As you have had dialogue with President-elect Biden about his thoughts about the State Department, do you think you will see us go back to the norm? Political appointees are often very, very important. I get it. And that is why the 30 percent is important. But do you think we will go back to the norm and see that two to one or 70 to 30 is a more likely path forward? Mr. Blinken. Yes, I do. Senator Kaine. Thank you for that. I am very worried. There has been questions about issues in the Western Hemisphere and I am worried that we just pay attention to the Western Hemisphere when there is a crisis. If there is a caravan, we are going to be paying attention to it or, you know, significant drug trade from Colombia we are going to pay attention to it. But then we sort of lose attention and we tend to look at the world as if it has an east-west axis and not a north-south axis. President-elect Biden, I think, starts with some real good will in the region because when he was vice president he did spend significant time working with our State Department and other professionals to sort of build relations in the Americas. I still think there is just tremendous upside in this. It is hard for the U.S. of 330 million to sort of match up all the time with nations a China with a billion people. But the Americas, from Tierra del Fuego to Patagonia--Tierra del Fuego to the Yukon would have about a billion. So the more we can do in tandem with other nations in the Americas, the more we can advance our own economic and security interest. I do not think we should do it just because China and Russia and Iran are getting involved in the region, but that should make us worry. Talk to me a little bit about your big picture perspective and that of the Biden administration on sort of an all-Americas policy or focus on our own--our own back yard. Mr. Blinken. Thank you--thank you for raising that. You know, you are right. This has actually been an area of focus for the president-elect. I went back and counted not so long ago and I think he made 16 trips to countries in our hemisphere as vice president, and even before that when he was a member of this committee he was very focused on a number of issues in the hemisphere, starting with Colombia, Plan Colombia, and what followed, and then as vice president a real focus on Mexico, on the Northern Triangle countries and, for that matter, issues throughout the hemisphere. And he has a strongly-held view that we have a strong national interest in doing what we can to advance the future for our hemisphere that is democratic, that is middle class that is secure. And there is a lot that we can and should be doing as partners with countries throughout the hemisphere to advance that vision. So in terms of the way we are resourced, in terms of the way we are focused, I feel confident that this is going to get sustained attention, not what you rightly described as sort piecemeal attention. Senator Kaine. Episodic. Mr. Blinken. Yeah, episodic. Senator Kaine. I look forward to working with you on that. Let me ask you a question about Israel and Palestine, which has come up already. The two-state solution--this has been U.S. policy since Truman in one way or another, certainly since the Oslo Accords, and yet sometimes I feel like our policy is to say two-state solution is our policy. But it has been hard for us to find a meaningful path forward. I paid my first visit to Israel in 1998. I have been to Israel more times than I have been to Ireland and I have relatives in Ireland. I really value the U.S.-Israel relationship. But the prospects for a peaceful Israel and Palestine existing side by side are worse today than they were in 1998 when I first visited and I find that tragic. Mr. Blinken. Yeah. Senator Kaine. And what is the challenge of not having a meaningful two-state solution? Let us just talk about COVID. There is a vaccination campaign going on right now that in Israel is viewed as one of the, you know, leading and most innovative in the world in terms of vaccinating high percentages of people. But virtually no one in Palestine has been vaccinated, and the Israeli health minister says, when we are done with our citizens then we will focus attention on our neighbors. So the Palestinians are in this odd space where they are sort of not in or of their own country. They are in a country but they are not considered citizens. They are considered neighbors. This is the kind of thing that suggests we really do need to find a path forward. I do believe the Trump administration's success in the Abraham Accords is notable and I applauded it right out of the gate. How might we use the improved relations between nations in the Arab world with Israel to help advance the prospect, finally, since the late 1940s, the prospect of a two-state solution? Mr. Blinken. Well, first of all, I very much share the premise of your comment and question, which is, as I see it, the two-state solution, however distant it may appear, is still the best and probably the only way to truly assure Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state and, of course, to give the Palestinians the state to which they are entitled. The challenge, of course, is how to--how to move forward on that at a time when you rightly said seems more distant than it has ever been, at least since Oslo. I hope that the progress that was made with the Abraham Accords, which I applaud, the steps that countries are taking to normalize relations with Israel is an extremely positive development and one that we would hope to build on, if given the opportunity. I hope that also might create a greater sense of confidence and security in Israel as it considers the--its relationship with the Palestinians because whether we like it or not, whether they like it or not, it is not just going away. Senator Kaine. And these nations that have now normalized relations can play an important role in both economic support for Palestinians but also providing security assistance, and they may be more willing to do that now that they have normalized relations in this way. Well, Mr. Blinken, thank you. My time is up. I do want to work with you and the State Department on issues about war powers, the cleaning up of the various authorizations from 1991 and 2001 and 2002 that are still floating out in space with no time or geographic limit. I look forward to working with the State Department and the White House on that. Mr. Blinken. I would welcome that. Thanks, Senator. Senator Kaine. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Kaine. Appreciate that. Senator Portman is up next but I am told that he is indisposed at the moment, which turns to you, Senator Paul. We will get back to Senator Portman. Senator Paul? Senator Paul. Thank you. Like Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, you have been a consistent supporter of military intervention in the Middle East, from the Iraq war, the Libyan, to the Syrian civil war. Some on your side of the aisle, including the president- elect, have said, well, we were given bad intelligence. They misled us on the intelligence on Iraq. That is a very specific reason. There is probably some truth to it. But I think it misses sort of the lesson of the Iraq war. Likewise, your justification for maybe coming to a new approach on the Libyan civil war is, well, maybe we overestimated the idea of having viable successors there. To me, it seems like we are still missing the point because even after Libya you guys went on to Syria wanting to do the same thing again, and you have argued, well, maybe we just did not do enough. If we would have done more, we could have toppled Assad and we could have had real regime change in Syria. Well, you got it in Iraq, you got it in Libya, and it is a disaster. The lesson of these wars is that regime change does not work. People say, oh, we are going to get rid of the iron fist and Thomas Jefferson is going to rise from the ashes. Well, that, you know, is a naive notion to believe that Thomas Jefferson or his like live in Libya or live in Iraq. Their tradition is so much different than ours. I mean, we have been fighting against centralized power in the English tradition for a thousand years. The revolution in England was 350 years ago. Ours was 250 years ago. That tradition they do not have. They have tribal existence. You trade one for another. But, mostly, what you have gotten through the policies you have advocated and Joe Biden has advocated and, frankly, John Bolton has advocated this idea of regime change has been a disaster for the Middle East. We complain--everybody around here is concerned, Iran, Iran, Iran. Well, why is Iran stronger? Who is their best friend in the region now? Iraq. You know, we did that. We had a balance of power. It wasn't perfect but we had somewhat of a balance of power in the Middle East and you guys messed it up. You got rid of the one bad guy and another bad guy got stronger. And so then you went to Libya and did the same thing, and then you said, well, maybe Libya is a one off. Well, maybe there is a rule here. Maybe there is something we can learn about regime change and maybe we can learn that humility would be. Then maybe we shouldn't be choosing every government in the Middle East. I would argue that instead of always choosing the Government, maybe we should not reward the bad ones. You know what I mean? So, for example, with Saudi Arabia, I despise the regime. I would probably still trade with them. I probably would not cut them off completely. I would not sell them any more arms, and after they killed Khashoggi they shouldn't have gotten one bit of our armament. But both sides advocate for this. On UAE we tried to stop that because UAE has a terrible human rights record. Both sides support it. The problem around here is we have bipartisan consensus. The problem isn't lack of consensus. The problem is too much consensus, but the consensus is for regime change. Are any of the lessons you have learned from the failure of Iraq war, Libyan war, the chaos, the vacuum, and more terrorism that occurred and more lives that were lost, and then to go on to Syria, I do not get that there has been a lesson learned. Is there any kind of lesson learned on your part that regime change may not be the best thing for us in the Middle East? Mr. Blinken. Senator, I think we, and I certainly have an absolute obligation to try to learn from everything we have done, advocated, to take into the account the results and to make that inform how we think about these problems, going forward, and I have done a lot of hard thinking about some of the very situations you mentioned. I am proud of the fact that I have spent all of my career during the times I have been in government for the better part of 25 years, working to advance our diplomacy, to do everything we possibly can to make sure that diplomacy is the first answer, not the last answer, and that war and conflict is a last resort. Senator Paul. The next step was Syria. The next step was the Syrian civil war, which looks a lot like the Iraq war and the Libyan war. Mr. Blinken. Well, in Syria--in Syria there were those who were advocating for a repeat of Iraq, which is to say a whole scale intervention. That is something that I did not agree with. When we were looking at what to do in Afghanistan---- Senator Paul. But here is the problem in Syria. It is-- there was a predictable result there. Had you gotten rid of Assad, who were the fiercest fighters over there? Al-Nusra and al-Qaeda. The most--the more radical you were the better fighters you were. The program that you started with Hillary Clinton, that program that trained these--the moderate rebels, we spent $250 million. We trained about 60. We sent 10 of them into battle and they were captured in the first 10 minutes. It was a complete disaster. This whole idea that there were moderates over there that we were going to support--doctors and lawyers and stuff--there were, but I do not think they were out there fighting. The ones out there fighting were jihadists, al-Qaeda, Al- Nusra, and if they would have taken over the country--Assad is a terrible person but I am not positive that these people would have been better. So, I mean, it is the same lesson. Our humility has to be let us quit toppling regimes over there. Let us do not support the bad ones, but let us not presume enough that if we topple them that in the vacuum Thomas Jefferson is going to arise, because it never seems to happen. With regard to advise and consent, and this is a little bit on Senator Barrasso's--extension of his question on treaties-- it really isn't so much a solicitous move to say well, we just cannot pass these treaties so we are going to make all these agreements and not coming to you. But I would argue even more importantly on war, you have argued when you have been part of administrations that oh, yes, you know, we would like--like Senator Kaine's, a more narrow AUMF but we do not really need it. And you are not alone. That sort of, I think, arrogant executive sort of attitude comes from both parties. Every president for the last 50 years have--in fact, they all probably believe this. They believe they have absolute power. It is called this absolute Article 2 authority, and this runs on both sides. But it runs through the extremes on our side. The John Bolton's on our side believe in this absolute Article 2 authority. The AUMF from 9/11 had nothing to do with people in Somalia. Do you think the AUMF from 9/11 authorizes you to continue the war in Somalia? Mr. Blinken. I think the AUMF from 9/11 has been used in countries and against groups that were not contemplated or cited in the AUMF, which is the very strong reason why we should revisit it. Senator Paul. But it is very specific. It says people who organize to attack us. It does not mention--you know, and people say, well, they say and associated forces. That is not in it. That is--somebody dreamed that up later and sort of said that it is in. It is not in there. It does not say associated forces. There is no authorization for war in Somalia, Mali, Yemen, which the Obama administration originally did support. So there really isn't. I am not for a more narrow one. I am just for no more war over there. I am tired of all the war. I am tired of all the nation building. Look, I love the rights of women as much as anybody. But if our goal is going to be that we are going to keep women in power, like in Saudi Arabia we are going to go to war with Saudi Arabia because they do not have women ministers of health and stuff, you know, it really isn't exactly our national security you are talking about. You are talking about something different. Now, from the point of view of the secretary of state, there are things you can do through soft power to advocate for the principles we believe in. But overthrowing governments to instill women's rights or to continue with women's rights and to continue a military presence there and fight battles for it is really not something that is in the purview of the secretary of state or, really, under the Constitution to anyone in our government. With regard to NATO, you have advocated for expanding NATO. Do you still support putting Georgia in NATO? Mr. Blinken. If a country like Georgia is able to meet the requirements of membership and if it can contribute to our collective security, yes, the door should remain open. Senator Paul. So if you are successful, then we would be at war with Russia now? Mr. Blinken. I actually think just the opposite. I think that, Senator, with regard to NATO membership, there is a very good reason that Russia has proved aggressive against countries that are not actually in NATO and under the umbrella and a good reason why it has chosen not to---- Senator Paul. This would be adding Georgia that is occupied--this would be adding Georgia that is occupied to NATO. Under Article 5, then, we would go to war. Mr. Blinken [continuing]. Well, I think we have seen, again, in the past that countries that have joined NATO have not been the same target of Russian aggression that we have seen. Senator Paul. Yeah, I know. But if we were talking about 20 years ago we might have a valid argument now. Russia occupies Georgia. Russia occupies or proxy troops occupy part of Ukraine. So I think adding either of them to NATO not only is provocative but you would have to think what comes next. I mean, if we are obligated to defend our NATO allies, I mean, basically, we would be voting for war. So I would not vote to add Georgia to NATO, not on your life, unless I am ready to send my kids and your kids to go fight in Georgia. You know, the complicated fights and wars and occupation around, and I just think that we need to think these things through, and I think for every provocation there is a response as well. So we cannot look at it in a vacuum. People say, I do not care what Russia thinks, or, I do not care what Tehran thinks. But if we do not understand our adversaries enough to think how they will respond, then I do not think we are doing our job. Mr. Blinken. I agree with you. Senator Paul. But as you can tell, I am not excited about more military intervention in the Middle East. I think there has been some chastening on the part of the incoming administration over previous failures. But I do not think you have completely gotten the idea that regime change has been a terrible disaster that has created vacuums, chaos, and actually more terrorism throughout the region. So I hope you will consider that. It is important not just for the philosophic point but it is important for our kids. I mean, we are sending these kids over to fight in these wars that go on forever and ever and ever, and somebody has got to stand up, and I hope you will be somebody brave enough to stand up and stop some of this. Mr. Blinken. I appreciate what you said. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Paul. Next up is Senator Markey, who, I am told, is joining us electronically. Senator Markey, are you with us? Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. Can you hear me, Mr. Chairman? The Chairman. I can hear you, Senator Markey. I cannot see you but---- Senator Markey. Okay. The Chairman [continuing]. Well heard here. Senator Markey. Okay. Thank you. Much appreciated. Let me ask this question. Aside from rejoining the WHO, which President-elect Biden has already committed to doing, what will the Biden administration do to ensure that the vaccine is disseminated quickly and fairly so that every country has a chance to protect their citizens regardless of their wealth? Mr. Blinken. Thank you, Senator. The president-elect has said that we are committed to making sure that, to the best of our ability, the vaccine is distributed properly and equitably. We intend to join COVAX. We believe strongly that we can do that, ensure that every American gets the vaccine but also help make sure that others around the world who want it have access to it. The WHO is a very imperfect organization in need of reform. But one of the reasons that the president-elect has determined we should get back into the WHO is that we are going to be in a much more effective position to advance that reform of the WHO if we are there at the table than if we are outside the organization. So I think the combination of rejoining, taking part in COVAX, and then looking at how we can help make sure that the vaccine is equitably distributed is something that we are going to take on. I would say that, you know, in addition to that, we are seeing now the potential for a lot of COVID tails to wag the COVID dog around the world in ways that will come back, potentially, to hurt us. We are seeing the potential for a debt crisis among emerging economies and developing economies. We are seeing public health crises in country after country because COVID has made it more difficult to provide other health services, and we are seeing state fragility increase, not decrease, as a result of many of the challenges that COVID has exacerbated or, in some cases, led to. So we have a national interest in helping and in doing our part to make sure that as the vaccine becomes available we help get it out there as quickly and as effectively as we can. Senator Markey. So is the Biden administration committed to seek additional funding for the Global Fund and other programs meant to respond to the massive public health needs related to COVID-19? Mr. Blinken. In short, yes. One of the things, though, that I should say is that Congress has done a very good service, I think, in providing the funding that is already on the table in terms of COVAX and that initiative. But I think that additional resources are likely to be needed. Senator Markey. Okay. Thank you. Moving on to North Korea, if we could, in moving forward towards the goal of ultimately denuclearizing, would you support an attempt to achieve a phased agreement that offers tailored sanctions relief to North Korea in exchange for a verifiable freeze or other restrictions on North Korea's WMD programs? Mr. Blinken. I think we have--I am sorry. Go ahead. Senator Markey. That is the question. Mr. Blinken. I think we have to review and we intend to review the entire approach and policy toward North Korea because this is a hard problem that has plagued administration after administration, and it is a problem that has not gotten better. In fact, it has gotten worse. But I begin by acknowledging the fact that it was a hard problem to begin with. So I think one of the first things we would do, and we would welcome being able to consult on that, is to review the entire approach. Look at what options we have and that can be effective in terms of increasing pressure on North Korea to come to the negotiating table as well as what other diplomatic initiatives may be possible. But that starts with consulting closely with our allies and partners, particularly with South Korea and with Japan and others, and reviewing all of the bidding. And so we will start there and we would welcome a conversation on that. Senator Markey. Okay. And if I can just follow up. And I agree with you, we have to increase enforcement so that China and Russia abide by the sanctions meant to target the regime. But we also have to ensure that we do not inadvertently harm the North Korean people, particularly as they suffer from famine and the effects of a complete lockdown of their borders due to the pandemic. When North Korea reopens its borders, will you support easing some of the restrictions to allow legitimate humanitarian assistance to reach the North Korean people? Mr. Blinken. I think in North Korea and in other similarly situated places we have to have an eye clearly on the people of the country in question and on doing what we can to alleviate their suffering and even if we have a strong grievance with the regime or with the government and that we are taking action to do something about that. We, to the best of our ability, try to do so in a way that, in the first instance, isn't harmful to the people of the country. And so we will take a hard look at that in the past, as previous administrations have engaged the North Korean nuclear challenge. They have found ways to make sure that humanitarian assistance, medical assistance, et cetera, could, in fits and starts, get to the North Korean people. So we do want to make sure that in anything we do we have an eye on the humanitarian side of the equation, not just on the security side of the equation. Senator Markey. Thank you so much. You know, and we have heard a lot today about the JCPOA in Iran. The bottom line is that the single greatest existential threat in the region is a nuclear Iran, and we must take that off the table before we look to making the agreement longer and stronger, as you say. Would you commit to reentering the JCPOA without any preconditions as a starting point so long as the Iranians return to all of their commitments as well? Mr. Blinken. What the president-elect has said on that, Senator, is that if Iran returns to compliance with the JCPOA, we would do the same thing and then use that as a platform, working with our allies and partners to build a longer and stronger agreement to also capture some of the other issues that need to be dealt with regard to missiles, with regard to Iran's activities and destabilizing activities in the region. Having said that, I think we are some ways from even that. There is a lot that Iran would need to do to come back into compliance. We would then have to evaluate whether it had actually done so. So I do not think that is anything that is happening tomorrow or the next day. Senator Markey. Okay. Thank you. Saudi Crown Prince Bin Salman's declaration that the kingdom may illegally seek a nuclear bomb makes the task of returning Iran to compliance with the JCPOA all the more urgent. Will you press the Saudis to come clean about their reported ballistic missile cooperation with China and assist that they adopt the additional protocol which would give the IAEA the same type of access it has in Iran? Mr. Blinken. We want to make sure that to the best of our ability all of our partners and allies are living up to their obligations under various nonproliferation and arms control agreements and, certainly, in the case of Saudi Arabia that is something we will want to look at. Senator Markey. Thank you. And on the New START agreement, is the administration going to extend it by a full five years? Mr. Blinken. So we had an opportunity to talk about this just a little bit earlier. What the president-elect has said is that very cognizant of the fact that we have one president at a time and that we could not really engage on this issue during the transition. We have the challenge because, as you know, the deadline to act or not on an extension comes upon us very, very quickly. We have got just a couple of weeks to do that. So I think this is something that we will be coming to you on pretty much immediately after the president is sworn in, and I know that he does intend to seek an extension and we have to--he will have to make a decision as president about what duration we would seek. Senator Markey. Thank you. I think it is very important. I am looking forward to working with you on that. I just think that is an incredibly important historic moment. And, as you know, the Trump administration rolled back much of the United States' previous efforts to support and promote LGBTI rights around the world and I am thrilled that you and President-elect Biden have indicated that you are going to support and appoint a new special envoy for human rights on LGBTI people, a position that I have been pushing to make permanent through my International Human Rights Defense Act but which was left vacant in the Trump years. After four years of Trump administration efforts to specifically marginalize, minimize, do damage to the rights of the LGBTI people, I think it is going to be vital to appoint a seasoned expert on those issues. Are you going to move forward towards a speedy appointment towards an LGBTI envoy and would you consider raising it to ambassadorial level? Mr. Blinken. The answer to both questions is yes, absolutely. This is a matter, I think, of some real urgency. We have seen violence directed against LGBTQI people around the world increase. We have seen, I believe, the highest number of murders of transgender people, particularly women of color that we have seen ever. And so I think the United States playing the role that it should be playing in standing up for and defending the rights of LGBTQI people is something that the department is going to take on and take on immediately. Senator Markey. Thank you. And will you repudiate the findings of the report of the Commission on Unalienable Rights and reaffirm the United States' acceptance and adherence to the human rights laid out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and will you ensure that ambassadors are able to fly the Pride flag at our embassies once again around the world? Mr. Blinken. Yes to both. Senator Markey. Beautiful. Thank you. And one final question on Rohingya. If confirmed, will you commit to overseeing an interagency process to make the determination as to whether the crimes committed against the Rohingya in Burma constitute genocide? Mr. Blinken. Yes, I would. Senator Markey. Thank you. And, by the way, thank you for all of your work on climate change. I think it is just a huge historical change of direction and congratulations on having John Kerry be named as your partner on those issues. How quickly is the department going to be able to move onto make sure that we have made climate change a top issue and that we put climate justice at the center of what we are advocating for globally? Mr. Blinken. Well, given Secretary Kerry's leadership, I suspect immediately. Senator Markey. Excellent. And climate justice? Mr. Blinken. As well. This is something that we will very much factor into what we are--what we are doing around the world. Senator Markey. Thank you so much. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Markey. Senator Markey. Thank you. Looking forward to working with you, Mr. Secretary. Mr. Blinken. Thanks. Thank you very much, Senator. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Markey. And I am told now that Senator Portman has extricated himself from whatever was more important than this hearing, and so I am going to recognize him at the present time. Senator Portman, are you with us? Senator Portman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am with you. Nothing could be more important than the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and I have been watching the hearing throughout the afternoon. And, Mr. Blinken, I also appreciate the time you spent with me on the phone talking about your plans for the department and how you would change some of the positions of the previous administration but also build on some of those. And I would just say in listening today it seems to me there are opportunities for us to build on some of the successes. I think about the Abraham Accords. I think about much of our policy toward Russia as an example of being able to provide, as we did this year at a record level, lethal weapons for self-defense in Ukraine. I think about what we have done in Belarus to try to promote democracy. I think about standing up to China, and I think that from what I have heard today that you would be interested in engaging on that issue even more, particularly as it relates to human rights and the Uighurs and other ethnic minorities and, generally speaking, you know, how to deal with Iran. We are going to have some differences of opinion, it sounds like, but I think you are fairly clear eyed on what the challenges are with regard to Iran and not being trusting of them and the way they are headed. Today, Mr. Chairman and to Ranking Member Menendez, there are five hearings going on. I have been in three of them, chairing one of them, and I think that is great. I think it is good that we are moving quickly with some of the key appointments including secretary of state but also secretary of defense, homeland security, director of DNI, Treasury, all important roles, and I hope we can get these nominations to the floor for a vote and then we will, you know, let the chips fall where they may. But I am actually supportive of us moving quickly and, Mr. Chairman, I know this happened because you were willing to do it in this interim period. As we discussed last week, Mr. Blinken, I have got lots of interest in this issue of disinformation and propaganda and how we push back against it. I think it is kind of the new warfare of the 21st century. Not that we do not have kinetic battles still but a lot of this is happening online and through disinformation. The Global Engagement Center was established at the State Department to deal with this. Senator Murphy spoke earlier and he and I have worked closely over four years now to try to strengthen the GEC, the Global Engagement Center, and give it the ability to push back disinformation operations by our adversaries. These tactics are inexpensive, and there is a lot of deniability associated with it. It is easy for them to do, and when you combine it with economic and political subversion it can be devastating to some of the nascent democracies we are trying to help. So thanks to the work of the Global Engagement Center, I think we now have the beginnings of an effective organization to deal with that and, again, I hope that is something that you would be willing to build on. Could you speak to that briefly and also talk about your commitment to the funding level? We were able to get $60 million in this year. That is half of what we wanted--less than half of what we wanted. But compare that to China, which, according to a hearing that Senator Booker and I had on combating disinformation recently, China spends over $10 billion a year in state- sponsored disinformation operations. I wonder if you could comment on the Global Engagement Center and the challenge we face. Mr. Blinken. Thank you, Senator. I could not agree more with your comments and with the work that you have done on this. This is the--perhaps a primary battlefield that we have to fight on, and even as we manage to deter aggression and kinetic action by adversaries, every single day we are experiencing aggression of one kind or another in the misinformation and disinformation realm, and we need to engage that and we need to engage that effectively. And, indeed, you are right, that is why the GEC was formed. I will tell you, I had the, you know, experience in the early days of the Ukraine conflict and Russia's aggression there in dealing with Russia using--weaponizing information in increasingly effective ways and, of course, little did we know what would come after that. But you will recall the downing of the Malaysian airliner and Russia was extraordinarily effective in mixing up and muddying the waters using misinformation and disinformation as to their culpability and responsibility. And out of some of these experiences there has been an effort at the State Department to give ourselves the tools and the resources to engage in this fight and the Global Engagement Center is exactly that. So I am determined to make sure that if I am confirmed that it is resourced adequately and appropriately. As well, I think we need to make sure that we are bringing in the talent, the expertise, to be able to use it effectively because these are specialized skills that, in some cases, many of us do not have. And to make sure that we have continuity because this is an ongoing battle every single day, we have conveyed the message that we would welcome the current leader of the GEC to stay on to make sure that we do not have any dropped balls in the weeks and months ahead. Senator Portman. Well, I thank you. Lea Gabriel has done a good job. I think Senator Murphy and I agree with that. I know both of us have weighed in with you and we thank you for that commitment to getting a sustainable funding level that is higher so they can do their job. I think $138 million is what we asked for this year. We got $60 million, and a lot of members of this committee are interested in ensuring it has the capability. And then the hiring authority--we need to extend our hiring authority so they can bring in some expertise from outside the department to deal particularly on the social media front. So thank you for that commitment. We look forward to working with you. On Ukraine, since you mentioned it, I was there in 2014 with Senator Cardin as an election monitor. It was right after the Revolution of Dignity. In the Maidan, the central area where the Revolution of Dignity occurred, was still smoldering. I mean, it was--it was fresh, and they have had some successes and we have had some setbacks. You know, Russia illegally annexed Crimea, which was a setback, and that Crimea annexation, by the way, is something we need to continue to stand up to, even as others in the region seem to be, you know, less aggressive about promoting, you know, the legitimate Ukrainian interest. We have seen what has happened in the Donbas, the displacement of thousands of civilians, deaths of a lot of brave Ukrainian soldiers. I am sure you have been to Kiev and gone to the memorial to those soldiers, as many of us have. But in 2019, we had free fair elections and President Zelensky and his party won by an overwhelming majority, and I know he has got an interest in working with you all. One thing that I am very interested in is the Ukrainian Security Assistance Initiative. This is something that is providing military aid to them but also training and, as you know, General Dayton has been very involved with that. So I guess two questions for you. One, are you supportive of continuing to provide the weapons to the Ukrainians to defend themselves, and second, with regard to the Ukrainian Security Initiative, are you willing to continue to work on that and, specifically, can you speak to General Dayton, who has been before this committee and, you know, made it out of committee-- never made it to the floor--as the potential next ambassador to Ukraine? Mr. Blinken. I very much support the continued provision to Ukraine of lethal defensive assistance and, indeed, the training program as well. I very much agree with you that this has actually been a real--a real success, and to the extent that across a couple of administrations we have been able to effectively train and as well as assist in different ways. The Ukrainians have made a material difference in their ability to withstand the aggression they have been on the receiving end of from Russia. And as to General Dayton, I have high regard from him and, certainly, will take a close look at that. Senator Portman. Well, I appreciate it. Again, he has gone through this committee already, a nonpartisan guy who has a great deal of experience but also respect in Ukraine. With regard to China, I know there has been discussion today of the importance of the U.S.-China relationship and I know there was discussion in the last question about working with China on global climate change and other issues, global health. I just--I just hope that in all of this we keep in mind the fact that China continues to irresponsibly and very systematically target U.S. researchers, U.S. research that is paid for by taxpayer dollars, and steal it, in effect--take it to China and use it for their own purposes. It has helped fuel the Chinese economy but also the Chinese military over the past two decades. We do have legislation that is bipartisan that came out of an investigation here in Congress that I chaired with Senator Carper. It is called Securing American Innovation Act. It deals with five specific areas, but one has to do with the State Department. And you and I did not get a chance to talk about this much earlier but I think you know the issue, generally. It provides the State Department with the authority to deny visas to foreign researchers whose problematic affiliations like to the PLA or to the Communist Party, for that matter, and access to export control technologies through fundamental research raised national security concerns. This is a balanced bill. We have support from a lot of the university community because we did take a balanced approach. And yet, we are interested in, and I think this bill would accomplish this, really tightening up our research enterprise here in this country so that we are not continuing to lose researchers and research to China through things like the Thousand Talent programs that we were able to investigate. Can you speak to that? Do you agree that we need these new visa authorities and can you talk about how we can better protect taxpayer-funded research, intellectual property, from China and others? Mr. Blinken. So, Senator, I very much welcome looking into that and looking into that quickly. I haven't had a chance to read the legislation. So I want to make sure that I do that--do that first. But I would welcome an opportunity to talk to you about that as soon as I have an opportunity to do so. I think the basic proposition I very strongly agree with. We need to make sure that we are protecting the intellectual property that is produced in this country. We need to make sure that we are protecting the technology that--if going to the wrong place that undermine our security, and we need to make sure that we have the tools to do that. So I welcome a chance to look at the legislation and talk to you about it. Senator Portman. Great. Your career folks at State Department have been very involved in it and, in fact, we had a fellow from the State Department who helped us put together the legislation, who was very helpful, from the visa division at the State Department. Israel. We talked about building on the Abraham Accords, some of the positive things that happened recently. I would like to hear your comments on that, but also with regard to global boycotts of Israel, Senator Cardin and I have worked together on this over the years to try to oppose the global BDS movement--boycott, divestments, and sanctions--against Israel, essentially, a double standard for Israel. And then Senator Booker and I have worked on the anti- normalization laws--in other words, adding to the efforts that you make every year to, you know, require countries to include their annual human rights records, also adding to that their people-to-people engagement with Israeli citizens and residents to try to normalize relations between the Arab world and Israel to the extent that we can. Can you talk about those two issues and how you feel about them and what your priority would be with regard to Israel? Mr. Blinken. Senator, yes, as we had a brief opportunity to discuss, I support the Abraham Accords. I applaud the work that was done to achieve them. I think they have significantly advanced the security for Israel and for the countries involved. It opens new perspectives and prospects with regard to travel, to business, to trade, all of which is very, very positive and I would hope that we have an opportunity to build on them, going forward. With regard to BDS, the president-elect and I firmly share this conviction, is resolutely opposed to BDS for the reasons that you cite. It unfairly and inappropriately singles out-- singles out Israel. It creates a double standard and a standard that we do not apply to other countries. And so I think we are very much in the same place on that. Of course, we fully respect and will always respect the First Amendment rights of Americans to say what they believe and think, but BDS itself is something that we oppose. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Portman. Senator Portman. Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Mr. Blinken. The Chairman. Thank you. I am told Senator Merkley is with us. Is that correct? Senator Merkley. Indeed. Greetings, everyone, and thank you so much, Tony, for your testimony. The advantage of coming near the end is that every topic I had planned to ask you about has been discussed to some degree, but I will invite you to explore, perhaps, a little more in depth starting with New START. One of the questions is how one extends New START and the advantages of a shorter period of extension or a longer period and how that might play in to possibly watching the negotiations to address some of the evolving threats in strategic nuclear weapons. Your thoughts? Mr. Blinken. Well, thank you, Senator. In the first instance, I think that for all of the challenges we have seen in certain arms control agreements with Russia, particular INF as well to some extent is Open Skies, I think based on what I have seen, based on what the Trump administration reported when it comes to New START, Russia was making good on its obligations and this--and New START is not some kind of gift we give to the Russians. It is manifestly in our self-interest in terms of giving us a predictable cap on the core of Russia's nuclear arsenal as well as giving us tremendous access to data and inspections that we otherwise would not have. And so, in our judgment, it is certainly in the national interest to extend it. As we discussed this a little bit earlier, because of our focus on making sure that we respect the principle of one president at a time, we--this is something that we will have to tackle but only when we--when the president-elect becomes president tomorrow. But it is also something we are going to have to engage very, very quickly because the deadline is very fast upon us. I think we will have 15 or 16 days left. So it would be our intention to come immediately to this committee and other committees to consult on our plans for the way forward. So but I can tell you right now we will seek the extension. The president-elect has to decide on the--on the duration. Senator Merkley. Thank you. Turning to China, I had authored a provision that required the administration, whichever administration, to respond by April to evaluate China's actions with the treatment of the Uighurs, and that has now been done with today's determination by the administration, by Secretary Pompeo, that it constitutes genocide, which I know you have spoken to and you said you agree with. You also mentioned you would like to see us stem the tide of products--imported products coming that are manufactured in that, essentially, slave economy. We have a bill--Senator Rubio and I have a bill, the Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act. It has a lot of sponsors in the Senate on both sides of the aisle. I mentioned it when we spoke before and you said you would take a look at it. I want to check in and see, among the millions of things you have prepared for, if you have been able to take a look at it and if this strategy, trying to keep the U.S. supply chain free of products tainted by forced labor, is one you can support. Mr. Blinken. Senator, I am afraid I haven't had a chance to actually read the legislation. But I would be more than pleased to do so quickly, if confirmed. And, as you note, the decision today, the finding today, I think only underscores the urgency of engaging on this issue. So I commit to doing that quickly, if confirmed, and getting back to you. Senator Merkley. As well as something to a separate meeting, I believe you confirmed to Senator Markey that you would look into the expiration of genocide in regard to Burma's treatment of the Rohingya. Mr. Blinken. That is correct. Senator Merkley. And I appreciate that Aung San Suu Kyi had invited, in her U.N. speech following the horrific massacres in August several years ago, to come and see for yourselves. So I led a congressional delegation to see for ourselves. The Burmese Government blocked us from going to the villages as they did with virtually every other group in the world, and, certainly, I think our failure to call it out as genocide has been an encouragement to dictatorial aggressive regimes around the world with what they might be able to do against a disliked minority. And so I appreciate that you are willing to deal with that very directly. I also appreciate you also addressed the issue of exploring asylum for those in Hong Kong who have been politically persecuted for defending democracy, and it is another place where we can really help stand up for democracy. But, again, I missed your comments but I believe you addressed this and expressed support for exploring providing such asylum. Mr. Blinken. I did. Senator Merkley. Thank you. I wanted to turn to the Northern Triangle. It was Vice President Biden who went down to try to work out an economic package to assist the Northern Triangle quite a few years ago. He asked Senator Carper to oversee how this was going. I traveled down to the Northern Triangle with Senator Carper about a year and a half ago, and I cannot say it was real encouraging, in part because of the multiple challenges of taking on, assisting nations where drug enterprises have become so incredibly powerful that they tend to corrupt everything. President-elect Biden has supported a renewed significant economic package. Can we deliver such economic help without, in essence, strengthening or feeding corruption in those countries, and if so, any insights on how we do that? Mr. Blinken. The short answer, Senator, is I think that we can but I do not want to minimize the difficulty. When we did the initial package during the Obama/Biden administration and this was, again, I think, a real bipartisan achievement in getting that support, the vast bulk of the assistance did not go through or to the governments in question. It went, typically, through third parties and it was tied very explicitly to concrete reforms on the part of these countries in criminal justice, in policing, in combating corruption, in creating economic opportunity, et cetera, dealing with all of the drivers of migration. And, you know, the problem, of course, is that the--as you very well describe, this is not simply flipping a switch. These are systemic and endemic problems that take a lot of time as well as resources to try to turn around. But we did start to see, I think, some results in the Northern Triangle countries, and now we have what is admittedly an ambitious plan to pursue this but to do it in a way that does not send money for--not tied to concrete reforms and that is making sure that we are working with parties that will not use it for the--for inappropriate purposes and are not plagued with corruption. So I think it is doable. Anecdotally, I can tell you that the first time around one of the leaders of one of those countries was complaining to then Vice President Biden that he was not a direct recipient of this funding and it was going around him, and he said, why is that. And the vice president said to him, because you are corrupt, and that was the end of the conversation. But the program went forward. So having said all that, I think this is, again, an area where it would be very profitable for us to try to work together to make sure that if we are dedicating taxpayer dollars to this we are doing it in a way that is getting results. Senator Merkley. Well, one thing we heard repeatedly was one of the most effective things we did was provide extensive training and assistance to their positions that were equivalent to an attorney general. Mr. Blinken. Yes. Senator Merkley. There is also prosecutions and all sorts of investigative powers and capabilities they did not have. There was also an area where the governments were pushing back enormously, strongly, trying to stop that assistance because you had former presidents and--who had been arrested and current presidents under investigation and close friends and brothers and so on and so forth. Right now, we have in Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who has been named as a co-conspirator in three corruption and drug trafficking cases. Now, what is our--what should our posture be towards a president in that situation? Mr. Blinken. We were talking a little bit about this earlier. When we look at just generically the problem of corruption, it is without question one of the main drivers of conflict around the world. It is being weaponized as a tool by some of our adversaries. It is also, at the same time, the soft underbelly of a number of our adversaries. And so across the board we need to be better focused and better resourced, and I am determined that we will be, to combat corruption. I think there are very case-specific hard issues that we have to look at when it comes to individuals and individual leaders. But this is something that I think would bear focus, attention, resources, and collaboration with the committee. Senator Merkley. Will we terminate the so-called Safe Third Country Agreements with the Northern Triangle countries? Mr. Blinken. I am sorry. Could you repeat that? Senator Merkley. Yes. Will we terminate the Safe--so-called Safe Third Country Agreements with the Northern Triangle countries? Mr. Blinken. So, so far, as I understand it, it is only being implemented in Guatemala. I do not see it as an effective answer to the challenge. We would--we will be coming forward and we have already started to come forward with both an immigration reform plan in the United States itself but then other very specific ideas for how to make sure that our border is humane, orderly, and fair, and we have to deal with the drivers of migration, which we just talked about, particularly with regard to the Northern Triangle. We also have to make sure that we have, at least in my judgment, an asylum process that meets our highest traditions and I think also meets our legal and moral obligations. But that requires significantly more resources to make sure that we can adjudicate asylum claims on the spot and make sure that people who are deserving our protection get it and those who are not are removed in a dignified manner. Senator Merkley. I am going to interrupt you there, Tony, just because I am just about out of time and I want to close on climate, and one of the things that--tools that we have internationally is to express the use of international finance to support a conversion to renewable energy around the world, and we are all at risk if we fail in this effort. And will the administration push the international lending institutions that we participate in to stop funding new fossil fuel projects? Mr. Blinken. Yes. This is an area we want to focus on. We want to make sure that we are not doing anything to facilitate countries exporting dirty technology around the world, including something we see from China, which is in part through the Belt and Road Initiative and by other means, getting this technology around the world. It should not benefit from international financing to do that. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator. Senator Merkley. Thank you very much. The Chairman. Senator Young? Senator Young. Mr. Blinken, welcome to the committee. I enjoyed our conversation just days ago and I would like to pick up one of the threads of that conversation here as I begin to pose some questions to you. But and it pertains to the president's authority to make war and also existing legal authorities on the books pertaining to authorizations of the use of military force. I am jealous of congressional prerogatives. I know former Senator Joe Biden was jealous of those prerogatives as well and so he has longstanding and, I think, well established views on this topic and, frankly, I believe that the president-elect and I see very much eye to eye on this. That was my sense during our conversation. Could you kindly explain to the committee whether existing legal authorities through the '91 and '02 Iraq war authorizations still apply today? Mr. Blinken. I think it is long past time that we revisit these and review them. I think in many instances they have been cited and used in countries or against groups that were not part of the original authorization. And so this is--it is long past time that we do this, and I would welcome an opportunity to work with the committee on doing just that. I think as we talked about a little bit, one of the challenges in the past is we did try to do this a few years ago, and it is not easy to get--to get to yes. For some, the porridge is too hot. For others, the porridge is too cold and can we get a consensus around what is just right. But I would be determined and committed to working on that and as well for the reasons you cite the president-elect feels very strongly about this. Senator Young. Well, thank you. I will personally look forward to working with you and I would be remiss if I did not mention Senator Tim Kaine has been toiling on this effort for a number of years and I hope he will be a walking point on this as well. Last week, you no doubt saw that Secretary of State Pompeo made remarks pertaining to Iran, characterizing it as al- Qaeda's new home. Mr. Blinken. Mm-hmm. Senator Young. And the implications for the 2000 AUMF is something I would like to explore with you. Do you believe, based on the connection that Secretary Pompeo makes between Iran and al-Qaeda that a Trump or a Biden administration would have authority to strike Iran, or do you instead adopt the interpretation that if it is deemed necessary to engage in any sort of military action it would be the president of the United States need to instead come before this body for authorization? Mr. Blinken. It would certainly--it would be the latter. We would--we would, I believe, need to and should, in any event, come before the Congress in that situation. With regard to the statement the secretary made, that is something I intend to look into, if confirmed, very, very promptly. I haven't had a chance to see what the underlying basis is for that. But, obviously, that is something we would have to take very, very seriously. Al-Qaeda leadership has been in Iran for some time. At various points, it was--did not have full freedom of movement. At other points, it may have had the leash taken off a little bit. But the--what Secretary Pompeo cited publicly is something that I would be very concerned with. But I have to look at what is underneath that. Senator Young. In the past, Mr. Blinken--I am going to pivot to China and economic statecraft as it relates to China. You have indicated, I think, rightly that China and the Chinese Communist Party is, arguably, presents the greatest challenge geopolitically, geoeconomically, to the United States of America, but also technologically, militarily, and diplomatically. And I think you would agree that we need to push back on each of those different fronts vis-a-vis the Chinese Communist Party. On the economic front, however, I have said, I have written, I have been arguing for a number of years now that though it has been encouraging not see this issue elevated in our popular discourse, I think our approach has been, shall I say, lacking in the sense that we have engaged in what I would characterize as defensive measures, defensive countermeasures against the Chinese Communist Party--tariffs, for example--and we have engaged in those defensive countermeasures unilaterally as opposed to gaining more leverage by working with our partners and allies. So sort of two points. Do you agree that we need to engage more robustly our partners and allies so that we have more leverage? I suspect it is almost a rhetorical question. Mr. Blinken. Yes, I strongly do, and to your point, very quickly, as you know, when we are acting alone against Chinese excesses in the commercial area, we are about 25 percent of world GDP. When we have got allies and partners with us, depending on who it is, it is 50 or 60 percent. It is a much heavier weight for China to have to ignore. And so there is tremendous benefit in the effectiveness of pushing back on China when we are doing this with other similarly-aggrieved countries. Senator Young. So that is encouraging. So you and I are, blessedly, in agreement as it relates to that. I also think the United States needs to--for the lack of a better term, we need to play off that. We need to up our game. We need to out innovate, outcompete, and outgrow the Chinese Communist Party, and we have done this before. I mean, this is, arguably--this was the catalyst for our success in the Cold War. So how quickly we forget, and to that end, I have introduced legislation along with Senator Schumer called the Endless Frontier Act. You and I had an opportunity to briefly discuss that. The effort here is to spark innovation in what I will characterize is frontier sort of platform technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics, advanced manufacturing, things that may have a nexus with national security but, regardless, will grow our economy at a more rapid rate and, therefore, has geo-economic implications. So do you believe that the United States Government should be investing in these sorts of key frontier technologies, partnering with our allies and partners where appropriate so that we can lead the world in their development and broaden our innovation base? Mr. Blinken. I do. I think we can play a catalytic role. We have done that, as you say rightly, in the past. Part of this, at least in my judgment, is about making sure that we are unleashing the private sector to really focus on these issues, focus on these areas, and give it some support if it needs to have that support in order to do it. But, yes, I very much agree, and we had a chance to talk about this earlier. I am very appreciative of the work that this committee has done in a whole variety of areas but focused pretty much on the same objective when it comes to the LEADS Act, when it comes to the report that the chairman issued. I think there are a lot of common denominators. And to your point, Senator, I just could not agree more. This is, ultimately, about us, and when we are thinking about China and the competition with China, whether it is the adversarial nature of the relationship, the competitive nature, or even, in some cases, the cooperative one, ultimately, it begins with us and it is, in some cases, less about the growth of the Chinese threat and more sometimes about our own self-inflicted weaknesses. If we can get our own act together we can do a lot better. Senator Young. I agree with that. Oftentimes, and this happened in the Cold War, we were called by an adversary, what Ronald Reagan characterized as an evil empire, to become a better version of ourselves, and I see this as an opportunity for our country. Let us invest in ourselves Mr. Blinken. Very much agree. Senator Young. Let us become a better version of ourselves, and very good then. More broadly, moving beyond China, with this, you know, of course, of paramount importance, do you think we need a written plan, a written plan that lays out what our economic strategy is from a national security lens? Just as we have derivative of the National Security Strategy, we have a National Defense Strategy? Mr. Blinken. Yeah, I think that is a good idea. As you say, we have a National Security Strategy. We have a National Defense Strategy. Folks labor hard on this. I have spent some time on a few of those in the past, and I think we would benefit from the same in the economic realm. Senator Young. Well, should you be confirmed, and I suspect you will be, would you be willing to dialogue with myself and Senator Merkley-- Mr. Blinken. Yes. Senator Young [continuing]. On the global economic security strategy that we have that would affect this sort of change? Thank you Mr. Blinken. Absolutely, with pleasure. Senator Young. Last thing, I am going to turn to Yemen, and this has been explored by a number of my colleagues so I am not going to revisit many of the issue or questions that they posed to you. It has, indeed, been characterized as the worst humanitarian disaster, I think, rightly so, but it is also a major national security threat, seeing as it is the home of AQAP, arguably, the most dangerous branch of al-Qaeda. And what has not, I think, been discussed here is the dimension of soft power as it relates to Yemen. If the United States of America is partnering with Saudi Arabia and there have been violations of international humanitarian law--as I have argued, there were with respect for our military involvement in Yemen--do you think that undermines our argument when we talk publicly about the Chinese and their human rights violations as it relates to, say, the Uighur Muslims and the tension of Muslim organ extraction? Mr. Blinken. I do. I do. Senator Young. Okay. I agree with that. Another lesson I think we could--we could learn from this situation in Yemen is--relates to what happens when you deprive people of essentials--food, medicine--which is, effectively, what has occurred in Yemen in addition to the bombing of school buses and other publicized matters. So do you agree that the deprivation of essentials leads to the radicalization of individuals, as extensive literature shows, and that that could help al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and other groups like ISIS recruit more members? Mr. Blinken. Yes, I do. It is, certainly, a contributor and it certainly creates an environment in which recruiting people to extremism is facilitated. Senator Young. Okay. Well, I look forward to partnering with this administration and improving our efforts in Yemen on the economic issues, on China, and all the other issues that we addressed. Thank you, sir. Mr. Blinken. I would welcome that. Thank you, Senator. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Young. Senator Booker? Senator Booker. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am witnessing remarkable endurance, and not to you. It is actually your wife is showing extraordinary endurance and I think you owe her big time. Mr. Blinken. You have no argument from me on that. Senator Booker. All right. You went to the Stanford of the East, right? Harvard? Is that right? Mr. Blinken. That is correct. Senator Booker. Harvard Business School did a great report that diverse teams are much better teams in terms of their private sector performance. And I have been stunned in my travels around the world as a United States Senator when I go in country and meet with the State Department teams and see a shocking lack of diversity, not just ethnic and racial diversity but also religious diversity. And I really appreciate you talking about that in your opening statement. I heard the engagement I think you had--I think it was Chris Murphy and you had some discussions about it. I would like just to hear--I know your heart and I know your commitment to focus on these issues, but I would love to hear more specifics about how can you take a department that does not fully represent the rich diversity, the value of diversity of our country. How can you make the State Department and help to create it to be more reflective? Mr. Blinken. Senator, first, let me say that if I am confirmed to this job, I will view it as a significant measure of whether I succeeded or failed, however long I am in the job, whether or not we have finally put in place the real foundations to make sure that we have a workforce at the State Department that looks like the country it represents. And I say foundations because yes, we are going to make progress, real demonstrable progress on that. But as you know very well, it is not simply a matter now of appointing a diverse group of people to different jobs. We have to put in place much more systematically a recruitment process that stands the test of time and that reaches out into different communities in ways that we haven't done before. We have to have a retention process, because one of the problems that we have seen in the department is even when we have been able to recruit people from diverse groups we have often had trouble retaining them because we have not been sufficiently attentive or sensitive to some of the specific concerns that they have. And, finally, we have to have accountability, starting with the senior leadership, starting with the secretary of state, to make sure that we are following through on these commitments, and one way that we are going to do that, if I am confirmed to this, is I will appoint very, very soon a chief diversity officer who will ensure that we have benchmarks and that will ensure that we have transparency, including information that we will share with this committee, to make sure that there is a way of holding accountable the senior leadership. Senator Booker. Well, I think--I think that is really important, and as Senate Democrats--Senator Schatz and myself went to Chuck Schumer and asked him to publish every office's diversity statistics and, amazingly, that public accountability has shown the number of diverse members of Senate offices go up on the Democratic side considerably. I would also say that there is other issues. You know, there are unpaid internship programs at the State Department which really do select for certain people-- Mr. Blinken. And even paid. I think--and I know that there has been some work done to make sure that we actually have some resources for paid internships. Senator Booker. Yeah, and that is what I am saying. We should be looking at more paid opportunities that---- Mr. Blinken. Yes, absolutely. Senator Booker [continuing]. For people and I am doing some work on that, and I look forward to connecting with you on it. I was really appreciative of the dialogue that you and Senator Coons had about the Horn of Africa. I think we see what is beginning to look like a civil war in Ethiopia. I think the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam conflict is growing and, could, potentially boil over. Sudan and Ethiopia have growing tension and growing conflicts. As you know, the Horn of Africa is of extraordinary importance. We have seen humanitarian disasters there before of staggering human toil. We also have one of the more important shipping lanes where about 10 percent of all global cargo goes by. You said that you want to have diplomatic active engagement. What does that mean? Mr. Blinken. Well, in the first instance, it means actually showing up at the--at the right levels to use what diplomatic weight we have with the Government, with the leadership in Ethiopia, in the first instance, and there are a number of things that I think at the very least would need to be done on short order. Senator Booker. Can I interrupt you? Mr. Blinken. Yeah, of course. Senator Booker. So I actually think that all that is great but can I just ask you why not appoint a special envoy to the Horn of Africa? Does that seem like something that might---- Mr. Blinken. I will take a very quick look at that for the reasons that you cite. I do--I share the concern that you have that this is something that--the instability that was sparked by the aggression and events in Tigray. Now we have Eritrean refugees who are on the receiving end of atrocities. We have Eritrea possibly getting in. We have other states that are now being affected, and the potential for this to spill over is a real concern. And so yes, I will take a look at that. Senator Booker. And waiting for the deputy secretary. I do not know how fast we will get things confirmed for Africa, overall. I just think that this might be something that merits that because it could end up being another international disaster. I think I mentioned to you that I had one of the more amazing trips of my life with Senator Flake as well as some of my colleagues like Chris Coons to Africa. One of the first things that jumped out at me as we were flying to Zimbabwe to meet with President Emmerson Mnangagwa and talk to him about U.S. sanctions on his country, that he was flying back at that time from China. The headlines were China does not care about Zimbabwe's suppression of minorities or their political processes. The expansion of Chinese influence is stunning to me and I think that that is something that is far greater than, I think, people realize, and I will give you an example of this and I would like to hear your thoughts on the DRC as well. Clearly, we have another refugee crisis there. We have a tremendous makings of a humanitarian crisis. But I was stunned, and I think it was 2019--correct me if I was wrong--that 37 countries, including the DRC, signed a letter defending China's treatment of the Uighurs. I mean, imagine that. I have heard my colleagues talk about calling it concentration camps and genocide, and here you have China's influence has expanded so much that you have 37 ambassadors to the United Nations, including countries like the DRC that have been so thoroughly engaged by China that they are defending something as horrific as that. And so that, to me, especially in the continent of Africa, is something that should send alarms to all of us in terms of the global competition between two--freedom and democracy and a totalitarian or authoritarian governments that suppress minorities and wreak havoc, frankly, in terms of the humanitarian disasters. And I just want to hear more from you, perhaps, about how we are going to meet that specifically in the context of Africa in the context of--from the Horn of Africa to the DRC to challenges we have seen in the Sahel region. How do we begin to combat that Chinese competition? Mr. Blinken. So, look, I could not agree more with you and I think we are seeing in China's commercial diplomacy clear strategic intent that goes beyond the simple commercial proposition that may lie originally at the heart of what they are doing. But we have a couple things to work with. One is the fact that the way China engages in commercial diplomacy tends to be actually a pretty bad deal for the recipients except, possibly, for the--a leader, who may benefit from the corrupt aspect of that. So when China is coming in and it is saddling countries with debt in a way that they cannot possibly afford so that, ultimately, it either owns the asset when they cannot repay it or resources are taken away from the people to pay off this debt that winds up being a bad news story. When they bring in Chinese workers instead of using local workers to actually build the projects, no environmental standards, and then the corruption that comes with it, I think more and more countries that have been on the receiving end of China's largesse have come to regret it. That is one piece of it, and I think shining a bright light on the way China engages in commercial diplomacy, juxtaposing that to the way we do it is one way to help. The other thing is I think most--as I have seen it and it comes up in the polling, most people in most countries in Africa would prefer, if given the choice, to be engaged with us. Senator Booker. Absolutely, and that is why my hope is, again, often we have these silos of State Department, Commerce, Trade often, that aren't working in a cohesive plan, and what we are seeing happening in places like DRC where we have rare earth metals and other sort of business interests is we do not have a holistic plan that, ultimately, could strengthen the economy of a lot of African countries that play into our sense of larger purpose. I have six seconds. I will use it just to sound off to you about my frustrations in this global pandemic, that which is directly related to the economy, and so you have America seeing that first hand, the suffering. But we will be vaccinated if things continue on this pace, this nation will be vaccinated. This pandemic will be behind us. But in developing nations like in Africa, I have seen projections that until 2024 it could take to end that, which not only means a grievous loss of life globally but also means that the economic crises we are already seeing in these very poor nations will grow dramatically worse. If we are not saying this now and finding ways with global pharmaceutical companies to find a way, then we are relegating developing nations to a level of death, carnage, and economic collapse that is shameful, and I would hope, if you could just give me some assurances that you are aware of this and are committed to doing something about it. Mr. Blinken. Yes, absolutely. We are very concerned. We were talking about this a little bit earlier about the various tails that risk wagging the COVID dog and those are among the most concerning. Senator Booker. Thank you very much. From a guy who went to a safety school you turned out all right. I look forward to supporting you. Mr. Blinken. Thank you, Senator. Senator Booker. And Mr. Chairman, thank you. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Booker. Senator Cruz? Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Blinken, welcome. Mr. Blinken. Good to see you, Senator. Senator Cruz. Congratulations. Mr. Blinken. Thank you. Senator Cruz. And congratulations on making it to the end of a long hearing. And I suspect over the next several years there may be a number of issues on which we have disagreements. But let us start on some areas where we may have some common ground, and in particular, I want to start by talking about Nord Stream 2. In the last 18 months in the Senate, we have seen remarkable bipartisan agreement when it comes to Nord Stream 2. I have authored two separate pieces of legislation jointly with Senator Shaheen, bipartisan legislation, both of which have passed into law imposing strong sanctions to prevent the completion of Nord Stream 2. The first of those we passed in December, a little over a year ago, the second of those we passed just a little over a month ago. And, as a consequence, a pipeline that was on the verge of being completed halted in its tracks, and when we first started taking up the Nord Stream 2 sanctions legislation the pundits and observers all said there was no chance the sanctions would stop the pipeline. That has now been proven categorically false. The pipeline has stopped and, of course, a pipeline that is 95 percent complete is a pipeline that is zero percent complete because it is not operational. Just this morning, the State Department announced sanctions specifically on entities, one involving a specific vessel, the Fortuna that has been involved in Russians' attempts to complete the pipeline. Now, worryingly, there have been suggestions out of Moscow and out of Berlin that the Biden administration would reduce pressure and reduce efforts to stop Nord Stream 2. I would tell you, in terms of the Senate the sanctions legislation we passed--in order to get it passed it received the support of virtually every member on this committee. It has received the support of both the chairman and ranking member of this committee. It received the support of both the chairman and ranking member of Senate Armed Services, the chairman and ranking member of Senate Banking, the Senate majority leader and the Democratic leader, and it received the support of the same leadership in the House. And so when it comes to congressional opposition to Nord Stream 2, congressional commitment to stopping that pipeline from ever being complete, it is virtually universal and it is bipartisan. Can you commit to this committee today that the Biden administration will hold the line, will keep the sanctions, and will prevent the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from being completed? Mr. Blinken. Two things, if I may, Senator. First of all, the president-elect strongly agrees with you that Nord Stream 2 is a bad idea and he has been very clear about that. I need to look at the actual legislation. I am determined to do whatever we can to prevent that completion, the last hundred yards, I very much agree. I do need--I would need to consult with the president- elect--I haven't had a chance to talk to him about this--when he is president to make a determination on sanctions. In an ideal world and we probably do not live in one--in an ideal world, we will engage very quickly with our partners and allies in Europe and I think we would try to seek to convince them to stop this. But if that does not succeed, I think the tools that we have, including the tools that you provide, are something we would have to look very seriously at. I just cannot commit right now to doing that because I haven't had a chance to talk to president-elect about it. Senator Cruz. Well, I will note the European Union, in terms of our partners and allies in Europe, when they voted to condemn the Nord Stream 2 project the vote was something like 400 to 100. It was overwhelmingly to condemn the project. That being said, Angela Merkel and Germany have leaned in vigorously in support of it and this is, clearly, the number- one energy priority for Putin and Russia and it represents billions of dollars that fund Putin's aggression. Would a Biden administration be willing to stand up to German pressure? The Germans are going to press you and you are not going to convince Merkel to change her mind on this. And so will a Biden administration be willing to stand up to that pressure, particularly when the rest of Europe recognizes how damaging completing this pipeline will be? Mr. Blinken. I know his strong conviction that this is a bad idea, the Nord Stream 2. That much I can tell you. I know that he would have us use every persuasive tool that we have to convince our friends and partners, including Germany, not to move forward with it. But what I do need to do is make sure that I have actually consulted with him on the specifics of that. Senator Cruz. Well, I look forward to working with you on that, and I would note that both sets of sanctions we passed are mandatory and not discretionary, and so I will look forward to continuing to work with you on that. Let us shift to a second area where we may or not get agreement. You mentioned earlier in this hearing the importance of strengthening regional allies to stand up to China, and I have long believed that China poses the single greatest geopolitical threat facing the United States for the next century. One of those important regional allies is Taiwan. When you were at the State Department, rules were put in place concerning Taiwan that put restrictions on Taiwan that no other country faced, and in particular, that prohibited the display of symbols of Taiwanese sovereignty on U.S. federal property. I have been a vocal critic of those policies and in recent weeks the State Department announced that it was rescinding those policies. I think that is the right thing to do, and that Taiwan we should respect and treat with respect and I think strengthening Taiwan helps both the region and America stand up to China. What are your views today and would you seek to go back to the old policy that has been reversed? Mr. Blinken. So a couple things on that. I had a chance to mention this earlier. When President Tsai was running for office, I actually received her at the State Department, had a great conversation. This is some years ago. And then when she became president, I talked to her on a number of occasions and that in and of itself, I think, is important. There is the--the Taiwan Assurance Act and its requirements that I think is what, in part, triggered what the State Department and Secretary Pompeo have done. I want to see that process through to conclusion, if it hasn't been concluded, to make sure that we are acting pursuant to the mandate in the Act that looks at creating more space for contact. Senator Cruz. All right. Let us shift to another part of the world where I suspect we will have more significant disagreements, and that is Iran. You are a vocal proponent of the Obama/Biden Iran nuclear deal. I believe that was a catastrophically misguided deal. In the four years since the Obama administration was in office, the United States has, of course, withdrawn from that deal. Not only that, we now know a number of facts we did not know at the time the deal was being negotiated. One of the things--and in particular, we know the involvement of the IRGC with terrorism directly targeting Americans and murdering American servicemen and women. In 2016, Congress overwhelmingly passed CAATSA, which imposed mandatory terrorism sanctions on Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and we have since discovered the vast money in Iran that is intertwined with the IRGC, in particular, the financial sector, including Iran's Central Bank, and the energy sector, including the national Iranian oil company. Both of these sectors and entities have now been sanctioned under the terrorism authorities for funneling money to the IRGC. The Pentagon also has assessed that the IRGC is responsible for killing at least 603 Americans in Iraq. Do you believe it is in America's national security interest to lift those terrorism sanctions and to allow billions of dollars to go once again to funding terrorist activities? Mr. Blinken. I do not, and I think that there is nothing, as I see it, inconsistent with making sure that we are doing everything possible, including the toughest possible sanctions to deal with Iranian support for terrorism, its own engagement in that, and the nuclear agreement. And we said from the outset and we are serious about it, that the nuclear agreement was one thing but continuing and even strengthening our ability to push back and to deal effectively with Iran's egregious behavior including in the terrorism realm was something that we needed and should do. Part of the challenge now I think we have, Senators, because we have had this divorce, to some extent, from some of our allies and partners who, ideally, would be with us in pushing back against Iran's malicious activities, as a result of disagreeing over getting out of the nuclear deal, we are less effective than we might otherwise be in those other areas if we were working together. I think one of the benefits, should Iran choose to come back into compliance and we wind up doing the same thing is that we would at least be back on the same page with allies and partners, and that might make us more effective in dealing with these problems. Senator Cruz. You mentioned it was a priority defending LGBT rights. Mr. Blinken. Mm-hmm. Senator Cruz. Iran's record concerning the LGBT community is horrific. Mr. Blinken. I agree with you. Senator Cruz. They put to death, they execute people for the crime of being homosexual. Mr. Blinken. I agree with you. Senator Cruz. As long as they maintain that barbaric and inhumane policy, do you think it is appropriate for a Biden administration to allow billions of dollars to go to that regime? Mr. Blinken. The challenge that I think we face and, of course, we have--the biggest problem that we face with Iran, and I think that we, unfortunately, continue to face and it may get worse again, is that with regard to all of the egregious actions that Iran takes that you rightly point out, across all of these areas, an Iran that has a nuclear weapon or has the capacity to develop one or the material for one in very short order risks acting with even greater impunity than it already does. So I think the first order of business has to be to get that back in the box. That puts us in a much better position to try to deal with some of these truly egregious actions. Senator Cruz. And a final question because my time has expired, do you agree that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel? Mr. Blinken. Mm-hmm. Senator Cruz.--and do you commit that the United States will keep our embassy in Jerusalem? Mr. Blinken. Yes and yes. Senator Cruz. Thank you. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cruz. Let me try to wrap this up with just a couple of quick questions. You made reference way, way back some hours ago that the new administration was going to withdraw the support for the Saudi war in Yemen. Did I characterize that correctly? Mr. Blinken. That is correct, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. What does that look like? Mr. Blinken. I think it looks like, first and foremost, making sure we understand exactly what support we are actually currently providing and which we need to look at, and then withdrawing that support. But I want to make clear I think we have to be in close contact with Saudi Arabia, with our partner there. We need to be very clear about what we are doing, why we are doing something, and talk it through. But the main point is that for reasons that we have discussed we believe that continuing that support is not in the national interest. The Chairman. I hear what you are saying. I think the Saudis themselves would like to be in that position. I think they are having trouble getting away from the tar baby that they have been involved in for some time. What does that mean as far as recognizing who is the legitimate governance of Yemen, or haven't you crossed that bridge yet? Mr. Blinken. I do not think we have crossed the bridge. There is a recognized government in Yemen that is, basically, in exile. It is not operating from Yemen. I had some dealings with it in the past. There is, as you know, a U.N. process that seeks to restore a national Government in Yemen. But the hard reality is, as we were talking earlier, you know, 80 percent of the people live in areas controlled by the Houthis at this point. So we are a long way from that. The Chairman. That is fair. One thing we did not talk about, or I guess Senator Cruz may have alluded to this briefly, is there is significant amount of cash that is frozen again that is--Iran lays claim to. I think it is about $15 billion in three different countries, including South Korea. Are you aware of those funds or not? Mr. Blinken. Mr. Chairman, are these the funds from--the proceeds of oil sales that have been frozen, or something else? The Chairman. You know, I cannot--I cannot answer that. All I saw was that they are funds that are frozen that we had frozen because of our sanctions but that Iran wants their hands on. And I guess my encouragement would be that there not be any unfreezing of these funds or anything to try to get the Iranians to the table or anything like that. Mr. Blinken. I agree with that. The Chairman. We had a really bad experience with the pallets of cash, as you know, that--the infamous pallets of cash that were transferred. So I would urge you strongly in that regard. And then we also did not talk about bringing the American citizens home who Iran have. I am assuming you are all on board with that and that is something that if, indeed, we wind up negotiating with them, that--to me, that has really got to be in the first wave, I would think. So I would put that on your plate. Any comments on that? Mr. Blinken. Mr. Chairman, I feel very strongly that I would have, as secretary of state, first and foremost, the priority of making sure that our personnel, wherever they are, are safe and secure but very high up in the--in a hierarchy of things that I need to be responsible for, doing everything we possibly can to bring any American home who is being unjustly detained anywhere in the world who is a hostage, including in Iran. That has to be a priority. I had an opportunity as I was getting some briefings during the transition to make sure that one of the briefings that I asked for and got was from the current leader of our effort to bring unjustly detained Americans home, Roger Carstens, and I got a--we had a terrific conversation. I am very impressed with the work that he has been doing and, indeed, have--we have asked him to stay on for some time. The Chairman. That is good. Thank you. I appreciate that. I have to tell you, I am--I am greatly encouraged by our conversations earlier today before we came in here and then again today as your commitments regarding the Iran situation. I think it is--certainly, China is a bigger problem. But Iran, as I explained to you, I think, is a--is a flashpoint that could get out of hand very, very quickly because they are notorious for making bad judgments and pushing the envelope. I feel strongly in that regard. I feel strongly about how we go about this, and I know we meet regularly and talk with our friends from Israel. They want to get their two cents worth in substantially more than they did last time. So I appreciate your commitments in that regard. With that, Senator Menendez? Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and just some final questions, and you have had an extraordinary tour de force here. I think it shows not only, as I said at the opening statement, your intellect but the demeanor in which you come to all of these issues and the engagement with the committee. So just some final questions, because the world watches your hearing and I do not want some parts of the world to think they are getting away without some attention, so to speak. So Russia. Navalny, his poisoning and his arrest. SolarWinds, bounty on U.S. soldiers, election interference, the use of chemical weapons to assassinate opponents in different parts of the world. Clearly, clearly, Russia must face consequences for its actions, otherwise, it thinks they can continue to violate the international order. During the last four years, Congress had to assume a policy and leadership role in this regard. I authored CAATSA. In part, it was to deal with the Russians. What do you view as--well, first, well, do you agree that Russia has to have consequences for these actions and would we expect the Biden administration to pursue those consequences? Mr. Blinken. Yes and yes. You laid it out very powerfully and very succinctly when you just--the things you mentioned are egregious in so many ways. The president-elect has been very clear that there need to be costs and sustained consequences for some of these actions. It is worth--it would be worth, you know, when we have the opportunity spending the time on each one because they merit a deep conversation. I think, thanks to this committee, thanks to Congress, we have some tools in our--in our toolbox, whether it is CAATSA, whether it is Magnitsky, whether it is other authorities that we have including the authorities that were created during the Ukraine crisis that are extremely helpful in being able to impose some of these costs and consequences. The president-elect, in the context of talking about election interference, said that, you know, he has determined to make sure that there are costs and sustainable consequences and, of course, we need to look at that at a time and a place and the manner of our choosing. But this cannot go on unanswered. Senator Menendez. I appreciate that. I did not even mention the annexation of Crimea and the continuing invasion of Ukraine. So I appreciate that, and I would just offer that if you believe you do not have authorities that you could use, then please come back to the committee because I think you would find a bipartisan welcome to try to pursue those. Let me turn to Turkey. You know, Turkey, as the--what we aspired of Turkey, the bridge between East and West, the secular nation, the strong NATO ally, has not been realized under President Erdogan. The purchase of the S-400, which is a violation, clearly, of CAATSA, the engagement that it has had in destabilizing actions in Syria, the invading into the territorial waters of Cyprus in terms of its exclusive economic zone and seeking to drill there--Cyprus, a member of the European Union--a claiming of a whole area of what would be Greece's exclusive economic zone all the way leading to Libya, the support that Erdogan had for Azerbaijan and the engagement in its aggression in Nagorno- Karabakh, which cost so many lives and I believe there are war crimes involved there by the Azerbaijanis--all of this and so much more I hope we will not have under the incoming administration. President Trump, in my opinion, coddled Erdogan and he continued to move forward in all of these pejorative ways, including Libya, which I did not mention. I hope we have a clear view, a policy, as to what Erdogan is, what he is doing, when you can say about Turkey that more lawyers and journalists are under arrest in Turkey than in any other part of the world, and that is saying something considering some parts of the world. So are we clear eyed about Turkey under Erdogan? Mr. Blinken. We are very clear eyed, and the bottom line is that Turkey is an ally that in the many ways you cited is not acting as an ally should, and this is a very, very significant challenge for us and we are very clear eyed about it. Senator Menendez. Just one or two more. In your response to Senator Rubio, you mentioned Juan Guaido. Would we expect that the Biden administration would recognize interim President Juan Guaido as such, by virtue of the National Assembly? Mr. Blinken. That would be my expectation. I think what we want--what we very much want to do is, following up on what Senator Rubio was saying, is to come pretty quickly and talk to you about the way forward in Venezuela. I have to tell you, I am just not satisfied that anyone has a good plan that we think can deliver the results that we all share and seek. So that is something I would really welcome talking about very early on. Senator Menendez. As you--as you know, over 50, maybe more, nations including most of the European Union recognize interim President Guaid cents. The problem is we never took that national--international recognition and internationalized our efforts on Venezuela, and that takes the hard work of diplomacy. So that would be one thing I hope we would look at is internationalizing with our partners, and also I think the people who are fighting for freedom and then, ultimately, have to flee temporary protective status for Venezuelans here in the United States should-- Mr. Blinken. Absolutely. The president-elect is committed to that. Senator Menendez. Well, that is fantastic to hear. Senator Booker, my colleague from New Jersey, raised diversity with you. I raised it privately. I am not going to pursue it any more, other than to say I take you at your word that success in part of your term as the secretary of state will be how well we do in that regard. This is a long 20-year effort that I have been leading from the House and the Senate and, unfortunately, it is probably the worst department of all of the federal government's as it relates to diversity. So I hope that under your leadership we finally make progress and show the face to America--I mean, to the world of America that it is. You know, when I was in China and met with the gentleman from our embassy that was involved with human rights in China, he was an African-American who had actually engaged in the civil rights movement. That is a powerful message to Chinese--you know, those who are suffering and trying to create human rights in China. It was so powerful. I am paraphrasing what happened in the whole experience I had when I was there. But that is the type of message that I think we need to send. I hope that President Biden will follow on his pledge to recognize the truth of the Armenian genocide as the Senate did when it--- when we passed my resolution in December of 2019. The House has done the same. I think this is an appropriate action to take in recognition. I find it so difficult to have our ambassadors to Armenia go to a genocide observance but never say the word genocide, and that is something that I hope will change. Lastly, this committee has jurisdiction over arms sales and the arms sales process--the informal arms sales process under the current State Department has totally broken apart. I have no--speaking for myself, I have no ideological problems with arms sales of U.S. makers to other countries abroad when those countries observe the human rights and international law that we aspire to uphold globally. When they do not, then I have problems with it and that is where dialogue has to come in place with the State Department. Can I rely upon you to reengage in that informal process with the committee on arms sales? Mr. Blinken. Yes, you can. We will come back to regular order. Senator Menendez. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I have received a plethora of letters in support of Mr. Blinken's nomination and I would ask at this point unanimous consent to enter them into the record, and in light of COVID precautions, my staff would email those letters to the committee. The Chairman. That is acceptable. Without objection. [The information referred to is located at the end of this transcript.] Senator Menendez. My thanks to you, Mr. Chairman. I hope we can get Mr. Blinken confirmed either by unanimous consent on the floor and that, if not, at the earliest possible date which I believe if it is not unanimous consent maybe Monday of next week. The Chairman. I think we join in that. Just two quick things, Mr. Blinken. First of all, I want to associate myself with the remarks regarding Turkey. The expressions that the-- that Senator Menendez has laid out have been conveyed by me and I think by him also to the--every diplomat we get from Turkey and including by myself to Mr. Erdogan directly. And as far as Venezuela is concern, I am glad to hear your ideas on that. We want to hear some ideas on that because I think everybody is frustrated with what we thought was going to move very quickly and has not moved quickly. So that demands our attention. And so I would ask unanimous consent that all responses to prehearing and advance policy questions be added to the record. If there is no objection, so ordered. And then, lastly, for additional questions for the record, we have gone back and forth on this. Your staff wanted 9:00 a.m. My staff wanted 5:00. I think probably an appropriate compromise is 1:00 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, if that is agreeable with you. So with that, I will order that all questions for the record--the record will remain open but close at 1:00 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. And with that, again, gosh, what great patience you have with us and great stamina. Thank you so much, and especially for your wife sitting there through all this. That is great, too. So thank you. Mr. Blinken. Mr. Chairman, thank you--thank you for your courtesy. I deeply appreciate it. Thank you, Member Menendez. Thank you. The Chairman. You are very welcome. And with that the committee will be adjourned. [Whereupon, at 6:32 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.] ---------- ======================================================================= Additional Material Submitted for the Record Statements Submitted to the Committee Supporting Hon.

======================================================================= Remarks Made in the Senate by Senator John McCain Opposing the Confirmation of Antony J. Blinken to be Deputy Secretary of State\1\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, December 16, 2014, pp. S6892-S6694. [Submitted for the Record by Senator John Barrasso] ======================================================================= Remarks Delivered on the Senate Floor by Senator John McCain (R-AZ) DECEMBER 16, 2014 ---------- Mr. McCain. Madam President, I rise to discuss my opposition to the pending vote concerning Mr. Anthony ``Tony'' Blinken, who is not only unqualified, but, in fact, in my view, one of the worst selections of a very bad lot that this President has chosen. I hope that many of my colleagues will understand that I do not come to the floor to oppose a nomination of the President of the United States often because I believe that elections have consequences. In this case, this individual has actually been dangerous to America and to the young men and women who are fighting and serving our country. Mr. Blinken has been a foreign policy adviser to Vice President Biden since his days in the Senate, but as Robert Gates has noted, Mr. Biden has been ``wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.'' At the Special Operations Fund Annual Meeting on May 6, 2013, Mr. Blinken discussed a number of the administration's achievements, including, one, ending the war in Iraq responsibly; two, setting a clear strategy and date for the withdrawal from Afghanistan; three, decimating Al Qaeda's senior leadership; and four, repairing our alliances and restoring America's standing in the world. That is as Orwellian as any statement I have ever heard. Each and every issue--the conditions are a far cry from the so-called achievements that Mr. Blinken describes. In his capacity as an assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Adviser, Mr. Blinken has been a functionary and an agent of a U.S. foreign policy that has made the world much less safe today. Let's review some major elements of that policy, and in particular, Mr. Blinken's role in conceptualizing and furthering it. U.S. foreign policy is in a shambles. It is, at best, astrategic, and at worst, antistrategic. It lacks any concept of how to obtain our foreign policy goals. This has led to countless foreign policy failures, including the continued slaughter of the Syrian people by President Bashar al-Assad; the Russian reset that culminated with President Putin's invasion of Ukraine; the betrayal of our key allies, especially in Central Europe, not to mention Israel; failing to achieve a status-of-forces agreement that would help to maintain Iraqi security and stability; following similarly unwise strategies in Afghanistan--we will see the same movie in Afghanistan that we saw in Iraq if we have a date-driven withdrawal rather than a status-driven, conditions-driven situation; and our feckless position in negotiations with Iran on nuclear weapons that has failed to produce any progress towards an agreement. I could go into many other failures, such as the vaunted Geneva Convention of 40 nations that was supposed to arrange for the transition of power from Bashar al-Assad and the object failure of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and what will either be an imminent failure of an Iranian nuclear weapons agreement or an agreement that will be disastrous in the long run. There are two common sayings by the administration officials, not me, that have defined the President's approach to foreign policy: ``Leading from behind,'' and ``Don't do stupid [stuff].'' These approaches have resulted in a failed foreign policy that has made America and Americans less safe. Even President Obama's most strident supporters have begun to question the President's foreign policy decisions. In an article entitled ``Damage to Obama's Foreign Policy Has Been Largely Self-Inflicted,'' the Washington Post's David Ignatius, a key supporter of the administration's foreign policy goals, wrote, ``At key turning points--in Egypt and Libya during the Arab Spring, in Syria, in Ukraine, and, yes, in Benghazi--the administration was driven by messaging priorities rather than sound, interests-based policy.'' What has Mr. Blinken had to say about all of these issues, my friends? I will give you a few examples. On Iraq, at the Center for American Progress, on March 16, 2012--I am not making this up--Mr. Blinken said: What's beyond debate is that Iraq today is less violent, more democratic and more prosperous--and the United States more deeply engaged there--than at any time in recent history. Less violent, more democratic, and more prosperous. At a White House briefing on March 16, 2012, Mr. Blinken said: President Obama and Vice President Biden came to office with this commitment: To end the Iraq war responsibly. Both parts of that sentence are critical. End the war. Responsibly. Under the leadership of President Obama and Vice President Biden, who the President asked to oversee our Iraq policy--and who has made 8 trips to Iraq since being elected--we have followed that path to the letter. He went on to say: At every significant step along the way, many predicted that the violence would return and Iraq would slide backward toward sectarian war. Get this. He said: Those predictions proved wrong. He went on to say: Over the past three years, violence has declined and remains at historic lows--even after we completed the drawdown of U.S. forces late last year. Remember, he said this in 2012. Weekly security incidents fell from an average of 1,600 in 2007-2008 to fewer than 100 today. He went on to say: And in December, after more than eight wrenching years, President Obama kept his promise to end the war--responsibly. And, while Iran and Iraq will inevitably be more intertwined than we, and many of its neighbors, would like, one thing we learned, over more than eight years in Iraq is that the vast majority of its leaders, including the Prime Minister-- Who at that time was Prime Minister Maliki-- --are first and foremost Iraqi nationalists and resistant to outside influence from anywhere--starting with Iran. Everybody knows that the Iranians are probably the most influential nation in Iraq, certainly under Maliki. On foreign policy, December 27, 2013, he said: If we still had troops in Iraq today, the numbers would have been very small. They would not have been engaged in combat. That would not have been their mission, so the idea that they could or would have done something about the violence that is going on now in Iraq seems, to me, detached from the reality of what the mission would have been had they stayed in any small number. Now you don't have to take my word for it. Take the word of Secretary Gates, Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Crocker, and any knowledgeable person about Iraq, and I will insert their quotes for the record, including Ambassador Crocker, who said: ``Of course we could have left a residual force behind.'' Both Panetta and Gates said the same thing. At no time was there a public statement by the President of the United States or Mr. Blinken that they wanted to very seriously. In fact, they trumpeted the fact that the last American troop at that time--now we have many troops back--left Iraq and bragged about what a great day it was. On Fox News with Chris Wallace, September 28, 2014: Wallace: Finally, President Obama spoke to the U.N. this week, but I wanted to ask you about his speech to the U.N., saying-- general assembly last year, in which he said we are ending a decade of war. How could the President have been so wrong? Blinken: The president was exactly right. What we're doing is totally different than the last decade. We're not sending hundreds of thousands of American troops back to Iraq or Afghanistan or anywhere else. We're not going to be spending trillions of American dollars. Wallace: Mr. Blinken . . . he said all our troops left Iraq. In fact, he has just sent at least 1,600 troops back into Iraq. He said we've dismantled the core of al Qaeda. [And yet,] the Khorasan group which you struck in the first day is an offshoot of the core of al Qaeda, and, in fact, follows the direct orders of the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al Zawahiri. Blinken: Chris, they fled. Because we were so successful and effective in Afghanistan and Pakistan, they fled, because we decimated the core of Al Qaeda. They removed themselves. They went to Syria. At the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on October 30, 2014: The White House ``sought to leave a limited residual force'' in Iraq, but the Iraqi Government simply refused to agree to legal protections for such troops, said then-Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken, who argued the final decision to withdraw all U.S. troops ``was not the result of a failure to negotiate.'' ``It's something we worked very hard,'' he said. ``But . . . after a 10-year `occupation,' the Iraqi body politic did not want us to stay in Iraq. That's what happened'' . . . We were focused and acting on ISIL and the threat that it posed more than 1 year before the fall of Mosul, but the problem began to outrun the solution fueled by the conflict in Syria, Iraqi reluctance, and renewed sectarianism in Iraq in advance of elections with politicians on all sides playing to their bases. Statements such as these are so divorced from reality, one can only draw one of two conclusions: either that Mr. Blinken is abysmally ignorant or he is simply not telling the truth for whatever motive there is. By the way, here is what Ryan Crocker said on Iraq: As a former ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009, do you think it was a mistake not to push hard for the Status of Forces agreement with Iraq before the U.S. pullout? I would remind my colleagues, Ryan Crocker--probably the most respected member of our diplomatic corps alive today--said: I do. We could have gotten that agreement if we had been a little more persistent, flexible, and creative. But what really cost us was the political withdrawal. We cut off high- level political engagement with Iraq when we withdrew our troops. There were no senior visits, very few phone calls. Secretary of State John Kerry made one visit prior to this current crisis, mainly to lecture the Iraqis on how bad they were being for facilitating Iranian weapon shipments to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. And we left them to their own devices, knowing that left to their own devices, it would not work out well. So we have Mr. Blinken's comments, and juxtapose them with those of Ambassador Crocker. Here is what Leon Panetta, Democrat, Secretary of Defense said: It was clear to me--and many others--that withdrawing all our forces would endanger the fragile stability then barely holding Iraq together. That is from Secretary Leon Panetta's book. Then he went on to say: My fear, as I voiced to the President and others, was that if the country split apart or slid back into the violence that we'd seen in the years immediately following the U.S. invasion, it could become a new haven for terrorists to plot attacks against the U.S. Iraq's stability was not only in Iraq's interest but also in ours. I privately and publicly advocated for a residual force that could provide training and security for Iraq's military. Then he went on to say, talking about the Pentagon: Those on our side viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests. That is a statement by Leon Panetta. I will move on to Afghanistan. Mr. Blinken said: We have been very clear. We have been consistent. The war will be concluded by the end of 2014. We have a timetable, and that timetable will not change. This is why I am so worried about him being in the position he is in, because if they stick to that timetable, I am telling my colleagues that we will see the replay of Iraq all over again. We must leave a stabilizing force behind of a few thousand troops or we will see again what we saw in Iraq. So let's move on to Syria. In an MSNBC interview in 2014, responding to a question about President Obama's comment in August 2014 calling it ``a fantasy'' to say that arming the Syrian rebels 3 years ago would have helped the situation, Blinken: Fantasy was the notion that had we started to work with these guys-- Talking about the Free Syrian Army-- six months earlier, that that somehow would have turned the tide. Blinken: Candy, you know, Assad has been a magnet for the very extremism we're now fighting against. And it is inconceivable to think of Syria being stable with Assad as its leader. He has forfeited his legitimacy. ISIL right now is the wolf at the door. But the answer to both Assad and ISIL actually is the moderate opposition. They need to be built up, so that they can be a counterweight to Assad. In the near term, they need to be built up so they can work on the ground to help deal with ISIL. Candy Crowley: So ISIS is the wolf at the door now, but Assad, as far as the U.S. is concerned, is the next wolf at the door? Mr. Blinken: We have been very clear that there needs to be a transition in Syria, that as long as Assad is there, it's very hard to see Syria being stable, and he will continue to be a magnet for the extremists we are fighting. Crowley: But a transition is not the same as, we will actively help you bring this guy down. Blinken: The best way to deal with Assad is to transition him out so that the moderate opposition can fill the vacuum. That's what we have been working on. The more you build them up, the more you make them a counterweight, the more possible that becomes. Let me just remind my colleagues of what has happened. There is a guy named Caesar who about a year and a half ago smuggled out thousands of pictures. These pictures are the most gripping and horrifying I have ever seen. They were actual pictures which have been authenticated of the atrocities committed by Bashar Assad. They are wrenching, they are heartbreaking, and they are terrible. Now, 200,000 people have been butchered in Syria, and 3.5 million are refugees; 150,000 are still in Bashar Assad's prison experiencing atrocities such as this. These are little children here. These are little children. They have been massacred by Bashar Assad. What have we done? What have we done in response to this? First of all, amazingly, these photographs have been authenticated by this guy Caesar. He did testify before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It didn't seem to rise to the interest of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or the American people or this administration. I was at a refugee camp in Jordan where at that time there were, I think, 75,000 refugees. I was being taken around by a young woman who was a schoolteacher, and she said: Senator McCain, do you see all of these children? I said: Yes. She said: Those children believe that you have abandoned them, Senator McCain, that you Americans have abandoned them, and when they grow up, they are going to take revenge on you. So here we are, this incredible slaughter, massacre, torture taking place, and what is this administration doing? It is trying to make a deal with the Iranians and leaving Bashar Assad to wreak havoc on the Syrian people who are still able to fight, butchering them with barrel bombs. Most of my colleagues know what a barrel bomb is. It is a huge cylinder, and it is packed with explosives and nuts and bolts and pieces of shrapnell. Bashar Assad, unimpeded, flies his helicopters and they drop these barrel bombs. Then, when they capture these people, this is what is done to them. Today it is clear that what is happening is that we are attacking ISIS in Syria. We are not attacking Bashar Assad, this butcher. In fact, Bashar Assad has intensified his attacks on the Free Syrian Army--intensified them. Not surprisingly, the morale of the Free Syrian Army is very low. So General Allen and others have recently proposed a no-fly zone or an aircraft exclusion zone, an idea we have been arguing for, for about 3 years. This President still refuses to do it. It is heartbreaking. It is heartbreaking and it is tragic and it will go down in American history as one of the most shameful chapters because of our failure and the President's personal decision not to arm the Free Syrian Army when all of his key national security advisers--his Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton; the head of the CIA, General Petraeus; and Secretary of Defense, Secretary Panetta all strongly recommended providing arms to the Free Syrian Army. I will move on to Ukraine. Mr. Blinken: What Putin has seen is the President mobilizing the international community both in support of Ukraine and to isolate Russia for its actions in Ukraine, and Russia is paying a clear cost for that. The notion that this is somehow the result of Syria makes very little sense to me. . . . That's because this is not about what we do or say in the first instance, it's about Russia and its perceived interests. What Mr. Blinken doesn't understand is that weakness in one place translates throughout the world. When I tell my colleagues, when I tell my fellow citizens that we will not supply the Ukraine people with defensive weapons, they don't believe me. They have watched the country dismembered. They have watched Crimea go. They have watched the shoot-down on an airliner that nobody talks about anymore, and they continue to create unrest and killing in eastern Ukraine, and we will not even supply the Ukrainians with weapons with which to defend themselves. I see that I am nearly out of time. I would like to say I wish Mr. Blinken's words were matched by his deeds. At the Holocaust Museum, October 6, 2014, he said: A new notion is gaining currency: the ``Responsibility to Protect.'' It holds that states have responsibilities as well as interests--especially the responsibility to shield their own populations from the depraved and murderous. This approach is bold. It is important. And the United States welcomes it and has included it as a core element of our National Security Strategy, along with our commitment to prevent genocide and hold those who organize atrocities accountable. No one can look at those pictures, the thousands, and believe that we have held Bashar Assad responsible. He ended up by saying: Endorsing the responsibility to protect is one thing; acting on it is another. All of us in the international community will have to muster the political will to act-- diplomatically, economically, or, in extreme cases, militarily--when governments prove unable or unwilling to prevent the slaughter of their citizens. That is a remarkable statement from an individual whose actions have clearly contradicted that at every turn in literally every corner of the Earth. I know we will probably lose the vote, but I believe history will hold this administration accountable. History will hold those individuals who are part of this administration, who allowed these slaughters to go on--a dismemberment of a country called Ukraine, the first time a European country has been departitioned since World War II; the needless slaughter of thousands and thousands of Ukrainian men, women, and children, and the thousands and thousands of Syrian children. The list goes on and on. Now we are going to promote this individual to replace probably the finest diplomat I have known, Secretary Burns. Not only is Mr. Blinken unqualified, but he is, I believe, a threat to the traditional interests and values that embody the United States of America. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. __________ ======================================================================= Responses to Questions Submitted Prior to the Hearing of January 19, 2021 to Hon.
