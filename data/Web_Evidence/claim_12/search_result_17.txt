Trade battles with China, Germany, Britain, France, & Canada
During most of 2018-2019, the US president launched the largest trade war in a generation. Though played out through goods and services rather than bullets, a trade war has a real effect on everyday lives. The US consumer bears the majority of costs
passed along to businesses and hidden in the prices we pay. Economically struggling Americans feel the results in daily life, especially those who face stagnant wages that have not grown despite having the lowest unemployment we've ever had.
The average American cannot recover from a trade war with the same resilience that a corporation can. The only solution will be to actually engage in a trade policy that is not based on populist brinksmanship, which is what we've seen played
out for the last few years. As Trump positions China front and center, our country is also embroiled in trade battles with historic allies such as Germany, Britain, France, and Canada.

Virus proves emphasis on American production
Trump, who has long pushed to boost domestic manufacturing as part of his "America First" ethos, says the coronavirus pandemic proves his point. "Look, there's nothing good about what happened with the plague -- especially the death -- but the one
thing is, it said, 'Trump was right,'" Trump said. "These stupid supply chains that are all over the world ... one little piece of the world goes bad, and the whole thing is messed up." Trump did allude to taxes or tariffs on production done overseas.

Fact check: Trump claims China is paying new tariffs
False claim: "You're not paying for those tariffs. China's paying for those tariffs," the president told an Ohio crowd. "Until such time as there is a deal, we will be taxing the hell out of China."
Economists and experts told NBC News this is false. Consumers purchasing foreign goods are the ones who picked up the tab. J.P. Morgan estimated the cost of these tariffs on average U.S. families was more than $1,000.

Nominates opponent of World Bank to lead World Bank
President Donald Trump's pick to lead the World Bank described himself in 2011 remarks as a 25-year opponent to the institution & others like it, saying that they needed to be "thrown away" and started over from scratch. David Malpass made the comments
while speaking to a local Republican gathering in Albertson, New York, in May 2011. CNN's KFile reviewed a recording of his remarks which were posted on YouTube at the time.Trump's decision to nominate Malpass was met with some pushback, with critics
contending Malpass held views that are hostile to the bank's mission, which is to reduce poverty in developing nations through financial assistance.
The US president has chosen the leader of the World Bank since its founding in 1945, but the pick has
to be confirmed by the organization's board of directors. If confirmed, Malpass would succeed Jim Yong Kim, who was chosen by President Barack Obama in 2012 to lead the organization and re-nominated in 2016.

I disagreed with Ronald Reagan on trade; we need better
CLINTON: When I hear Donald's slogan, "Make America Great Again," I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, "You know, before you and President Obama were there," I think it's important to recognize that he has been
criticizing our government for decades. Back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just says now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.
He was criticizing President Reagan. TRUMP: Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I've been waiting for years. Nobody does it right.
CLINTON: This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into the middle and says, "I alone can fix it," as he said on the convention stage.
TRUMP: Yeah, we've heard this before, Hillary. And frankly, now we're going to do it right.

Stupid people negotiate our trade bills, & trade won't work

Donald Trump on North American Trade
Fact-Check:USMCA mostly a cosmetic refreshing of NAFTA
President Trump said, "One of the single biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law. The USMCA will
create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers."Fact -Check: The agreement updates NAFTA, covering things such as digital commerce,
which barely existed when the original deal was signed a quarter-century ago. But despite the president's claims, USMCA is mostly a cosmetic refreshing of NAFTA, not a wholesale replacement. On the whole, the USMCA's economic effects are expected
to be modest. The main benefit of the deal is that it avoids the disruption that would have come had Trump made good on his threat to scrap NAFTA with no replacement.

FactCheck: NAFTA displaced 851,700; but net loss 15,000/year
CLAIM: Trump, in urging Congress to support his new trade agreement, said he had met men and women across the country whose "dreams were shattered by NAFTA" [implying job losses].FACT-CHECK: One analysis of the Clinton-era North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) found that about 851,700 U.S. jobs were displaced by the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico between 1993 (shortly before NAFTA was implemented) and 2014. That's a data point that was cited by Bernie Sanders during his
2016 campaign, when he frequently decried job losses due to NAFTA.
A 2014 study found that while NAFTA has caused about 203,000 jobs to be displaced by NAFTA-related imports annually, imports support 188,000 new jobs, leading to a net loss of only
about 15,000 annually.
And the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote in 2017 that "in reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics... because trade with Canada & Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP."

NAFTA was worst trade deal ever; TPP is a close second
Trump: NAFTA was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation
where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. And now [Clinton wants] to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.
You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, "I can't win that debate."

China should buy more American farm products
During a meeting last year, President Donald Trump turned to Chinese President Xi Jinping and asked for an important favor: China should increase its purchase of American soybeans and wheat because aiding American farmers would help him win the upcoming
2020 election, according to excerpts of a new book by Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton.The request was made during the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan. In Bolton's book, the former adviser paints the president as someone consumed with
winning a second term and willing to pressure, cajole and plead with foreign powers to aid his quest.
'Trump's conversations with Xi reflected not only the incoherence in his trade policy but also the confluence in Trump's mind of his own political
interests and U.S. national interests,' Bolton writes according to an excerpt published in the Wall street Journal. 'Trump commingled the personal and the national not just on trade questions but across the whole field of national security.'

China is no longer a currency manipulator
President Donald Trump said that his administration will not label China a currency manipulator, backing away from a campaign promise, even as he said the U.S. dollar was "getting too strong" and would eventually hurt the economy. A U.S. Treasury
spokesman confirmed that the Treasury Department's semi-annual report on currency practices of major trading partners, due out later this week, will not name China a currency manipulator. "They're not currency manipulators," Trump said about China.
The statement is an about-face from Trump's election campaign promises to slap that label on Beijing on the first day of his administration as part of his plan to reduce Chinese imports into the United States.
The Wall Street Journal paraphrased
Trump as saying that the reason he changed his mind on the currency issue was because China has not been manipulating its yuan for months and because taking the step now could jeopardize his talks with Beijing on confronting the threat from North Korea.

Says China is paying BIG TARIFFS, but U.S. consumers pay
The most recent round of trade talks with China ended this week with no final agreement, following Trump's decision to more than double tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. Trump said that China should "act now" to wrap up a trade deal with the
U.S, warning that "far worse" terms would be offered to them in what he predicted would be his second term as president. Trump also suggested that the U.S. was "collecting" big tariffs from China: "Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting
BIG TARIFFS!" he tweeted.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow acknowledged that the Chinese do not directly pay tariffs on goods coming into the US, but instead American importers pay and oftentimes pass it on to US consumers, contradicting
Pres. Trump's claims. Kudlow said that "both sides will suffer on this," but argued that China will suffer significant GDP losses as export markets are hit. The blow to US GDP won't be substantial since the economy is "in terrific shape," he said.

them almost nothing.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. I asked them how they are doing with international sales. They told me--without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long
that they have become used to it--that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.
They weren't even asking for
change. But I am. I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE. President Lincoln, warned that the "abandonment of the protective policy will produce want and ruin." Lincoln was right--and it is time we heeded his words.

Protection will make America strong
For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength,
and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. The wealth of our middle class has
been redistributed across the entire world. But that is the past.
From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it's going to be America First. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs,
will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.

Two simple rules: buy American, and hire American
We will get our people off of welfare and back to work--rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American. We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world--
but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.

FactCheck: Yes, has opposed trade deals since Reagan
When accused of opposing Reagan's economic policy in 1987, Trump asserted that "I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade." Is it true that Trump opposed US trade deals in the past? Yes, for as far back as we have records: in his
2015 book, in his 2011 book, and in his 2000 book. Some sample excerpts:
- "There are people who wish I wouldn't refer to China as our enemy.
But they have destroyed entire industries and cost us tens of thousands of jobs."--Crippled America, p. 43-5, Nov. 2015
- "We need to bring manufacturing jobs back home--the jobs China is stealing."--Time to Get Tough, p. 37-9, Dec. 2011
- "You only have to look at our trade deficit to see that we are being taken to the cleaners by our trading partners. We need tougher negotiations [to] cut better deals with our world trading partners."--The America We Deserve, p.145, July 2000

FactCheck: No, VATs are not tariffs against US exports
Trump said, "Mexico has a VAT tax. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax, automatic, 16 percent. When they sell into us, there's no tax." Trump has never mentioned VATs before. Yesterday an economist at UC Irvine released a report analyzing Trump's
economic plan and taking aim at VAT taxes. [But that's not how VATs work].When a company in Germany makes goods to sell at home, it has to pay the VAT. But if it makes them to sell in the US, it doesn't--the tax gets waived at the border. If a US
company sells in Germany, it does have to pay the VAT. [The UC Irvine] interpretation is that] border adjustability turns the VAT into an "implicit export subsidy" for foreign companies and an "implicit tariff" on US exporters. This is just dead wrong.
Everybody has to pay Germany's VAT when they're selling goods in Germany. Nobody has to pay Germany's VAT when they're selling goods outside of Germany.
You can't really blame Trump for this one: a guy with a PhD in economics fed this stuff to him.

Tax imports when U.S. companies manufacture abroad
Q: How do you bring back jobs [outsourced by] American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back? A: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.
They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your
cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong. And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special
interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor.

Identify every violation of trade agreements, and prosecute
A Trump Administration will change our failed trade policy--quickly. Here are 7 steps I would pursue right away to bring back our jobs.- Withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not yet been ratified.
- Appoint the toughest
and smartest trade negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers.
- Identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will then use every tool under American and international law to end these
abuses.
- Tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers, or submit notice under Article 2205 that America intends to withdraw from the deal.
- Label China a currency
manipulator.
- Bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO, for China's unfair subsidy behavior.
- IUse every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs.

Restrict free trade to keep jobs in US
Q: You would end NAFTA, kill the Pacific Trade Agreement, impose tariffs on some products like 35% on Ford cars made in Mexico. TRUMP: I am all for free trade, but it's got to be fair. When Ford moves their massive plants to Mexico, we get nothing.
I want them to stay in Michigan.
Q: But the American Enterprise Institute says, your Trump Collection clothing line, some of it is made in Mexico and China.
TRUMP: That's true. I want it to be made here.
Q: The point is you're doing just what
Ford is--you're taking advantage of a global trading market.
TRUMP: I never dispute that. I just ordered 4,000 television sets from South Korea. I don't want to order them from South Korea. I don't think anybody makes television sets in the
United States anymore. I talk about it all the time.�We don't make anything anymore. Now you look at Boeing.�Boeing's going over to China.�They're going to build a massive plant because China's demanding it in order to order airplanes from Boeing.

20% tax on all imported goods
If we want jobs in America, we need to enact my 5-part tax policy: kill the death tax; lower the tax rates on capital gains & dividends; eliminate corporate taxes in order to create more American jobs; mandate a 15% tax for outsourcing jobs and a
20% tax for importing goods, and enact the 1-5-10-15 income tax plan [four brackets with a top rate of 15%].Government needs to stop pick-pocketing your wallet. Every time it does, it slows growth and kills jobs. It's also immoral.

Embrace globalization and international markets
The important thing to consider is that more and more there is an interdependence of world economies. No one can afford to be isolationist any more.
Keep your focus global. Globalization has torn down the barriers that have formerly separated the national from the international markets.

Signed USMCA to improve trade as "NAFTA 2.0".
Trump voted YEA USMCA Implementation Act
Summary from Congressional Record and Wikipedia:Vote to amend the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and establish the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Rather than a wholly new agreement, it has been characterized as "NAFTA 2.0"; final terms were negotiated on September 30, 2018 by each country. The agreement is scheduled to come into effect on July 1, 2020.
Case for voting YES by Rep. Charlie Crist (D-FL); (Dec. 19, 2019)The USMCA includes stronger protections for American workers and enforceable labor standards, as well as environmental protections. It eliminates the Trump Administration's threat that the US could walk away entirely from the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, which would devastate US jobs and our economy.
Case for voting NO by Jared Huffman (D-CA); (Dec. 19, 2019) Democratic negotiators did a lot to improve Donald Trump's weak trade deal, especially in terms of labor standards and enforcement, but the final deal did not reach the high standard that I had hoped for. The NAFTA renegotiations were a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lift labor and environmental standards across the continent--to lock in serious climate commitments with two of our largest trading partners and dramatically improve labor standards and enforcement to slow the rise of outsourcing.
Legislative outcome: Bill Passed (Senate) (89-10-1) - Jan. 16, 2020; bill Passed (House) (385-41-5) - Dec. 19, 2019; signed at the G20 Summit simultaneously by President Trump, Mexican President Enrique Nieto, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Nov. 30, 2018
