‘Petty, whiny, pathetic:’ Trump, longtime ‘cancel culture’ critic, tries to cancel iconic actor
President Donald Trump is celebrating bad news for a beloved actor.
The Washington Post first reported over the weekend that the alumni association at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point had canceled an award ceremony honoring actor Tom Hanks. Retired Army Col. Mark Bieger, the president and CEO of the West Point Association of Graduates, pinned the decision on the Army academy’s desire to fully focus on preparing future officers, according to an email circulated to faculty and reviewed by the outlet.
In June, Hanks, who is a staunch veterans advocate, was selected as the recipient of the prestigious Sylvanus Thayer Award, which recognizes an “outstanding citizen” who did not attend West Point, but has a distinguished record of service and represents the academy’s “Duty, Honor, Country” values. The ceremony was set for Sept. 25.
Trump took to his Truth Social platform to cheer on the cancellation of the ceremony — and delivered a pointed jab at the actor.
“Our great West Point (getting greater all the time!) has smartly cancelled the Award Ceremony for actor Tom Hanks. Important move! We don’t need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!!” Trump wrote on Monday.
“Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice. Watch their DEAD RATINGS SURGE!” he continued.
Critics of the president immediately slammed his gleeful post on social media.
“Proving yet again what a small, petty, whiny, pathetic loser he is,” Ron Filipkowski, the editor-in-chief of MeidasTouch, posted on X.
The “Republicans against Trump” account wrote, “To the people who voted for Trump to ‘fight cancel culture,’ aren’t you embarrassed?”
Political commentator Brian Krassenstein also chimed in: “Don’t worry guys! As the economy crumbles, we commit extrajudicial murders, and our trade partners ally with our enemies, Trump’s out here defending America from… checks notes… Tom Hanks."
“Put aside the stupidity of dissing Tom Hanks … Trump is saying that anyone who holds views different from those of him and his supporters are not Americans worthy of being honored," MSNBC columnist Michael A. Cohen added.
Hanks, who has criticized Trump in the past, expressed his support for former President Joe Biden, speaking at a campaign fundraiser in 2020, before he went on to defeat the president months later. In 2016, former President Barack Obama also awarded Hanks with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In its announcement, the group initially pointed to Hanks’ portrayals of U.S. service members in several movies, including “Forrest Gump,” “Saving Private Ryan” and “Greyhound.” It also cited his work in producing the World War II-themed miniseries “Band of Brothers” and “The Pacific.”
“Tom Hanks has done more for the positive portrayal of the American service member, more for the caring of the American veteran, their caregivers and their family, and more for the American space program and all branches of government than many other Americans,” Hon. Robert A. McDonald, the board chair, said in a statement at the time, according to The Washington Post.
It was not immediately made clear if Hanks would no longer receive the award.
