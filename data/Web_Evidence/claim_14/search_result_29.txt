Bills
After a legislative bill has gone through both houses, it is signed by both presiding officers — the Senate President and the Speaker of the House. The Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel then prepares the bill in final form and sends it to the Governor for his action. He can either sign the bill, veto it or allow it become law without his signature.
A bill enacted by the Legislature is effective 60 days following adjournment, unless another date is specified in the bill. It then becomes law.
You can see all the bills Gov. Cox has passed, vetoed or allowed to become law without his signature below:
