Donald Trump made big claims about Joe and Hunter Biden in Ukraine. Here's what you need to know
Since the impeachment inquiry was announced, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly defended his actions by attacking his opponent.
He claims that it's former vice-president and 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden who's in the wrong, responsible for some corrupt business deals involving his son, Hunter.
The US news network CNN has refused to run a Trump campaign ad that says as much, citing "demonstrably false" claims.
But the same ad is appearing on Facebook, during NFL commercial breaks and especially in Mr Trump's fundraising emails.
Which side should you believe? Let's review the facts.
What's in the advertisement?
In a dramatic voice over, the narrator of the 30-second TV commercial states that "Joe Biden promised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company".
"But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him," the ad continues. "And their media lapdogs fall in line."
Some of the images paired with "media lapdogs" include CNN's top reporters.
The network released a statement this week explaining it would refuse to air the ad on its 24-hour news network:
"In addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN."
The next day it announced it would refuse to run a second ad, titled "Coup," which accuses the Democrats of "fabricating evidence" to "undo the election".
The network allowed a third ad, focused on Mr Trump's accomplishments in office, to air.
First things first: Did Joe Biden use his power to help his son?
At the centre of the first commercial is a clip from Mr Biden boasting about his role in the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.
"If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money," he says.
"Well, son of a bitch, he got fired."
The clip is part of a full conversation between Mr Biden and the Council on Foreign Relations, in which he was asked about the Obama administration's decision to provide military aid to Ukraine.
It's true that in 2015, the then-vice president threatened to withhold nearly $US1 billion in aid unless Ukraine fired Mr Shokin.
In fact, Mr Biden was part of an international consortium pressing to fire Mr Shokin because he wasn't investigating corruption actively enough.
The policy was made by the State Department, in coordination with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
The concern was the West wouldn't get value for the huge amount of treasure it was sending Ukraine's way to help it defend itself against Russia.
The firing of Mr Shokin in 2015 was widely applauded, and Ukraine was granted the aid money.
So what about the ad is "demonstrably false"?
Mr Biden's motivation for firing the prosecutor.
The advertisement claims Mr Biden pushed for the firing because Mr Shokin was investigating "his son's company".
The company in question is the gas holdings group Burisma.
Burisma is not the younger Biden's company, but he did sit on its board for five years, starting in 2014.
In exchange for two annual board meetings, he was paid $US50,000 a month, all up collecting about $US3 million.
The younger Biden had little expertise in the resources sector, but he is a well-connected Washington lawyer and lobbyist with a powerful father.
Burisma's founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, is a former Ukrainian Resources Minister whom some have accused of using his influence to unfairly access gas.
Mr Shokin was investigating Burisma, but the inquiry wasn't active when the then vice-president pushed for Mr Shokin's dismissal.
In fact, the US ambassador to Ukraine at the time publicly criticised Mr Shokin for not doing enough to investigate Burisma.
Since the impeachment drama got underway, Ukrainian prosecutors have decided to reopen 15 investigations related to Burisma.
Ukraine's most senior prosecutor, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, says he's unaware of any wrongdoing by the younger Biden.
Got it. Why am I hearing so much about China?
China isn't mentioned in the ad, but it has become a big talking point in recent days as the President has suggested China, like Ukraine, should be investigating the Bidens.
The allegations stem from events in December 2013, when Hunter Biden joined his father on Air Force Two for a trip to Beijing.
Loading...Mr Trump and his staff have claimed the younger Biden "walked out of China with $US1.5 billion in a fund" while his father was vice-president, and that to this day China has a "sweetheart deal" with the US because of the Biden-China connection.
"You know what they call that," Mr Trump said. "They call that a payoff."
What happened was this: Less than two weeks after his trip aboard Air Force Two, Hunter Biden joined the advisory board of a private equity firm called BHR Partners, which publicly said it was trying to raise $US1.5 billion (That's likely where Mr Trump got the figure he claimed the younger Biden earned).
Hunter Biden arranged for his father, then the vice-president, to shake hands with one of the partners who formed BHR, according to the New Yorker.
The Wall Street Journal reports that Hunter Biden did not become a shareholder in the firm until October 2017, after his father's term had ended. His investment equates to roughly $US420,000.
TL;DR: The full extent of Hunter Biden's Chinese business dealings aren't known, but for now there's no damaging link between his work at BHR and his father's political power.
What are the Bidens saying?
China has responded to Mr Trump's claims by saying it has faith in America's ability to sort out its own problems.
Joe Biden, meanwhile, has vigorously denied the various allegations made against him and his son, saying he's not going anywhere.
"You are not going to destroy me, and you're not going to destroy my family," he said, calling out Mr Trump in a press conference.
"Trump knows there is no truth in the charges against me."
As journalists have continued to mine for evidence in the President's allegations, reporting from the New Yorker suggests Mr Biden was uncomfortable with his son's involvement in Ukraine from the outset.
"I hope you know what you're doing," Mr Biden reportedly told his son.
But the two didn't speak further about the younger Biden's business dealings, as was the norm for their relationship.
Hunter Biden is known to be the black sheep of the family.
In the years since his Ukrainian ties, he's landed in the tabloids for a messy divorce, an alleged relationship with his brother's widow and frequent substance abuse issues.
And though there's no evidence he did something illegal, he was paid millions to give Burisma a respected international face while his father branded himself as a politician who fights hard for the working class.
Back to the campaign ad — will the misinformation have an impact?
US media outlets have continuously decried the lack of evidence behind the President's claims, but he continues to repeat them, as do some of his supporters, as the primary evidence of why he shouldn't be impeached.
We know that Mr Trump has leveraged the "witch hunt" narrative to raise more campaign funds from his base, and that the campaign has directed millions of those funds into — wait for it — more television ads.
Will more ads have any effect on Democrats or Independents?
It's tough to say.
One poll suggests that Mr Biden's favourability has remained stable in the face of the latest news.
And other polls suggest that voters' support for impeachment is growing, but it's still far from overwhelming.
What's more easy to predict is that in the run-up to the impending impeachment battle, it's all but guaranteed that more facts and fictions will emerge.
