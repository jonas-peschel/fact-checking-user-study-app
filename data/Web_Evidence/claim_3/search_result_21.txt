EL PASO – Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden doesn’t want to tear down the wall, but he does want to cease all construction of fencing along the border.
Biden took direct aim at President Donald J.Trump’s signature promise to wall off the U.S. from Mexico in a wide ranging interview with journalists representing the National Association of Black Journalists and National Association of Hispanic Journalists, including The Dallas Morning News.
Biden said he wouldn’t dismantle the existing fence along the border, but will stop future construction and pursue a high-tech ‘virtual wall’ to ensure border security.
“There will not be another foot of wall construction in my administration,” Biden said. “I’m going to make sure that we have border protection, but it’s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it. And at the ports of entry — that’s where all the bad stuff is happening.”
According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, about 160 miles of barrier have been installed since Trump took office in January 2007. But less than 4 miles of barrier was new rather than just replacement materials. The cost has been more than $15 billion, although Congress authorized just $5.1 billion of that.
Much of the other money came by diverting funds intended for the Pentagon in 2019.
The full interview with the former vice president, which includes a number of other topics, is set to be released Thursday during the NABJ-NAHJ August 5-6 joint virtual convention. The journalists approached both Biden and Trump for interviews but only Biden’s organization accepted the invitation.
During the nearly hour-long interview, Biden also reiterated he’d end other key Trump initiatives on immigration, which critics have blamed for sparking a humanitarian crisis along the U.S.-Mexico border. He said he would discontinue the Remain in Mexico program, which requires thousands of people seeking asylum at the southern border to wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated.
Many have been stuck in large camps where medical care can’t keep up with poor health conditions. Others stay in hotels, taking cash jobs in the hope that they can survive until summoned across the border for court hearings.
Biden said he would carefully exit the program by first building an “infrastructure” that would include hiring enough lawyers, judges and grassroots organizations.
“We have to make sure that we build up the infrastructure to be able to accommodate Trump’s cruel and inhumane border policies ... ripping children from their mother’s arms and Trump’s migrant protection protocols, you know: Remain in Mexico program,” Biden said. “I mean, all of this is going to take time, not a long time, but it’s going to take, you have to be prepared, so we don’t create another crisis.”
He said he would stop “jailing” families seeking asylum, saying, “There’s ways to monitor without putting them in jail.”
The Department of Homeland Security, the agency that oversees much of Trump’s immigration policy, has come under intense criticism for tactics used by agents, including detaining undocumented in locations that the agency once considered “sensitive locations.”
Asked how he would hold the agency, whose tactics now extend beyond the border into cities like Portland, Biden said, “You hold it accountable by being president and acting accountable. I will have someone heading that department that listens to what we say.
“It’s outrageous, what’s being done now,” he said, rapping his fist on a table top. “This is about families, families, and you have so many young children, so many young children under enormous pressure and psychological pressure, wondering whether or not they’re going to come home and there’s no one there. We need to do so much more.”
He said he would also end land confiscations for the wall along the border, taking a more blunt position than when President Barack Obama did when he took office after President George W. Bush signed the Secure Fence Act in 2006.
“End. Stop. Done. Over. Not going to do it. Withdraw the lawsuits. We’re out. We’re not going to confiscate the land,” Biden said.
The Tuesday interview came a day after the first anniversary of the August 3, 2019, mass shooting that left 23 dead in El Paso. Biden was asked about the largest attack on Latinos in U.S. history and about how he would convince white supremacists that people of color are “vital to restoring the soul of America.”
“I don’t convince white supremacists,” Biden said. “They’re not going to be convinced. They have to be put in jail when they do things that are inappropriate.
“The reason I’m running is because of Donald Trump’s (and) what he said when those folks came out of the fields in Charlottesville,” he added. “I realize hate doesn’t go away, it just hides. And when a president breathes oxygen under the rocks, he pulls them out. He legitimizes them.”
Pressed further, Biden said while “white supremacists,” and the Ku Klux Klan are, in his view, a minority, he’d work toward “reaching out to everyone else.”
“A lot of prejudice out there, but not everyone is a white supremacist, like the kid who went in and gunned down those folks in El Paso. There’s a difference,” he said.
On China, Biden said he would not keep Trump’s tariffs, but rejected the suggestion that the Trump administration’s aggressive tactics toward China have worked.
“Manufacturing’s gone in recession. Agriculture lost billions of dollars that taxpayers had to pay. We’re going after China in the wrong way,” he said.
“China is stealing intellectual property. China’s conditioning, being able to do business in China, based on whether or not you have 51% Chinese ownership, that’s got to end.”
He said the key to pushing China to change its behavior is taking a multilateral approach and reengaging with world leaders
“The question is, what is the appropriate behavior that they have to engage in international trade with us? They have to play by the international rules, and what we have done is, we have disarmed ourselves,” Biden said.
“We make up 25% of the world’s economy, but we poked our finger in the eye of all of our allies out there.”
For months, Trump has poked at Biden’s verbal gaffes, nicknaming him “Sleepy Joe”
Last month, Trump tried pumping up his own mental fitness for office by pointing out some of the specifics of a cognitive test he said he had taken.
“Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV,” said Trump, parodying his answers and igniting a firestorm on social media, with TV hosts and comedians soon mocking him on late night shows.
In the interview, Biden clarified that he has not taken a cognitive test, arguing against his need for one. Questions about the mental fitness of Trump, 74, and Biden, 77, have been testy at times as both men disparage each other while defending their own prowess.
“No, I haven’t taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test?” said Biden. Biden appeared to liken a cognitive test to taking a drug test for a job or even before his interviewers sat down with him. “Come on, man. That’s like saying you, before you got on this program, you take a test where you’re taking cocaine or not. What do you think? Huh? Are you a junkie?”
Biden said American voters will make the ultimate decision about who’s mentally and physically fit to serve as president.
Biden said he looks forward to debating Trump. The November 3 election is less than 90 days away. Biden’s leads nationwide polls and in some polls in traditionally GOP Texas, the race between Biden and Trump is now a toss up.
“I’m so looking forward to have an opportunity to sit with the president or stand with the president and debates,” Biden said.
“I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical, mental… My physical, as well as my mental fitness and … you know, to make a judgment about who I am.”
Biden acknowledged that the majority of people who have had COVID-19 are Latino or Black, and pledged to invest billions in those communities hardest hit by the virus and “tackle the inequalities in education.”
“In the course of this pandemic, Black and Latino Americans have been three times as likely to get infected and twice as likely to die,” he said. “Blacks and Latino, you know, Americans are disproportionately out of work facing evictions, losing hope. The communities are the first ones to get hit and the last ones to get any relief. We need an overwhelming response to right that wrong. "
Reporters at the interview included journalists from the Atlanta Journal Constitution, CBS News and National Public Radio.
