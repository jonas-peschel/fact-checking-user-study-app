How Revenue is Being Shared from the Federation Account
The Nigerian government financial system operates a structure where funds flow to the three systems of government from what is termed as the federation account.
The federation account serves as the central pocket through which the governments-Federal, State and Local government-fund developmental projects as well as maintain their respective workforce.
Revenue allocation in Nigeria has a chequered historical antecedent. Many committees in the past were set-up at different times in the Nigeria national history and were saddled with the responsibility of examining various fiscal issues and recommend the best principles and formulas in sharing national revenues to meet-up the challenges of the time.
The Chairman of the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), Mr Elias Mbam, told journalists in Abuja that the federal government is planning towards setting up a committee to review the revenue sharing formula for federal, state and local governments due to current economic realities and it will also be reviewing the remuneration of political office holders in the country.
In the current revenue allocation formula, the FG gets 52.68%, State Governments get 26.72% and the Local Governments get 20.60%.
They are basically two main components that make up the Revenue Allocation Formula. This formula is used for the disbursement of funds from the Federation Account. They are the Vertical and Horizontal Formulae.
The vertical formula shows the percentage allocated to the three tiers of government i.e. Federal, States and Local governments. The formula is applied vertically to the total revenue available for disbursement in the Federation Account at a particular point in time.
The Vertical Allocation Formula allows every tier of government to know what is due to it; the Federal Government (52.68%), the 36 States (26.72%) and the 774 Local Governments (20.60%).
The horizontal allocation formula applies to States and Local Governments only. It provides the basis for the sharing of the revenue generated and already allocated en bloc to the 36 States and 774 Local Governments through the application of the principles of horizontal allocation formula, the allocation due to each State or Local Government is determined.
As at the time of this article, the Horizontal Allocation Formula is applied to the different components that make up the Horizontal Allocation Formula as follows: Equality – 40%; Population – 30%; IGR Effort – 10%; Landmass & Terrain – 10%; Education – 4%; Health – 3%, Water – 3%.
There may be a need to review the revenue formula due to the realities of the day. For instance, Population is a key determinant for the Horizontal allocation formula, however, Nigeria last had a population census in the year 2006.
The population count of some states may have changed due to insecurity and migration. This by implication would put more pressure on states that have experienced an upsurge in their population due to some of these issues. Also, it is well observed that States with smaller LANDMASS irrespective of their population size is at a disadvantage.
Another point to consider is the contribution of Population against that of Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). While IGR contributes 10% to whatever States or Local Governments receive, Population contributes 30% – which is 200% of IGR contribution. If Nigeria hopes to address its population growth concerns, then it needs to disincentivize population increase.
Finally, A static Revenue Sharing Formula will put developing States at a disadvantaged position, taking into consideration that these states often attract more people for the seemingly extra comfort they offer. The review of the formula is due and will go a long way to address some of the financial challenges some States are facing.
