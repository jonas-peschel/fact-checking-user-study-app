American Revelers Ring
A s worries faded with the old year. New Year's
revelers pocked Into spaces as large as Times
Square, as historic as the Alamo o r as Intimate as
a Chicago blues bar and greeted 1906 today with
optimism and all the familiar spirits.
" I t 's the old feeling. They are glad the old year
is over.” said Enrique AlmendarU. a Chicago
bartender. "People for some reason are thinking
'86 w ill be a more prosperous year. I felt they
were very optimistic all night.”
T o make sure everyone got home alive, police
manned highway checkpoints, cab drivers and
transit systems took down fare signs, volunteers
poured free coffee and groups in Texas and
Georgia offered free fuqerals to drunken drivers
killed In accidents during the holiday who had
pre-reglstered.
Some 300.000 people braved the rain to watch
Boston’s 10th annual First Night celebration. A
quarter m illion In New York braved each other's
company — there were 10 arrests for charges
Including assault — to cheer a 200-pound. 6-foot
red apple as It descended at I Times Square at
midnight.
Optimistic '86
About 60.000 people came to Alamo Plaza In
San Antonio to watch yet another illuminated
ball hoisted to the top o f the E m ily Morgan Hotel,
while fireworks launched from Mississippi River
barges lit the night sky over New Orleans.
In Pasadena. Calif., thousands of would-be
viewers staked out curb space Tuesday as an
army of volunteers prepared for the 97th annual
Rose Parade.
President and Mrs. Reagan marked the stroke
of midnight with a kiss at a party hosted by

at the request of the White House In response to Friday's
terrorist strikes at airports In Rome and Vienna In which
18 people were killed, five o f them Americans.
The sources stressed the request for the options is part of
routine contingency planning. Similar options have been
prepared following other terrorist attacks against Ameri
cans In the past two years. None ever has been carried out.
Out. coupled with statements from the White House and
State Department about the right to retaliate for terrorist
strikes, publicity about the military options may be
intended to make Libya's leader. Col. Moammar Khadafy,
nervous and uncertain of U.S. plans.

Syne” is played.

Reagan and Gorbachev Urge Peace
In Historic New Year's Greetings
By United Brass Inter— t l— si
The leaders ol the two most powerful
nations in the world celebrate the New Year
today by urging global peace In historic
television messages to be beamed across the
United States and the Soviet Union.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and
President Reagan arc to make simultaneous
appearances on American and Soviet televi
sion today at 1 p.m. EST (9 p.m. Moscow
time.)
The two leaders agreed during the Geneva
summit last month to exchange New Year
greetings in direct addresses to citizens ol
their respective nations.
It will be the first time an American
president has appeared on Soviet television
since Richard Nixon addressed the Soviet
people In 1972.
Each message is about five minutes long.
Gorbachev's address is expected to in
clude his opposition to space-based nuclear
weapons with an appeal that Washington
abandon the "Star Wars” defense program.
(light attendants are in the midst
of a 30-day cooling oiT period.
The flight attendants, who are
disputing the pay cuts in court,
will be free to strike when the
period expires Jan. 20.
Robert Callahan, president of
Local 553 of the Transport
Workers Union, said Tuesday
strike ballols will go out to the
6.300 flight attendants next
week, but he added that he’s
"confident" a settlement will be
reached by Jan. 20.
Callahan said the union got a
lift from a court recommenda
tion Friday that the airline
restore 18 percent to the flight
attendants' wages. The pay cuts
have been in effect for two years.
Callahan said the recommen-.
d a tio n by U.S. M a g istra te
Herbert Shapiro means Eastern
may have to pay the flight
attendants about $33 million In
back wages for 1985.
However. Cosley said the mag
istrate's recom m endation Is
"seriously flawed" and Eastern
will argue against it before a
federal judge.
Callahan said negotiations on
a new wage agreement have
been "extrem ely difficult." but
he added. "I'm confident we will
find a negotiated settlement."
"W e have all of these factors
which make this an extremely
dicey situation." he said. "W e
have a brand new management,
with a whole bunch of people

” W e in the Soviet Union stand Ibr

The Soviet people celebrated the arrival of
the New Year eight hours earlier than most
Americans because o f the difference in time

festivities were very similar.

Turlington To Campaign
Against Casino Bill
TALLAHASSEE (UPI) - Edu

Turlington says his first priority
In 1986 will be defeating a
p ro p osed c o n s t i t u t i o n a l
amendment on casino gambling
— even if If means ruin for his
own bid for a state lottery, it was
reported today.
" I f I were to take a first
priority, my first priority would
be to see that this amendment
fails." Turlington said. "M y op
position to casinos, because of
what they would mean. Is that
strong."
Turlington, who is resigning
his C abinet seat to lead a
petition drive on the lotteries
question, also conceded he Is
having difficulty collecting the
money and signatures he needs
to place his proposed constitu
tional amendment on the 1986
ballot, despite money and help
from the state's two teachers'
unions, the Tampa Tribune re
ported.
But he said he doubted 111 will

to his pro-lottery Initltlative.

raise money for schools. He said
he believes voters can spot the
difference between lotteries and
casino gam b lin g, w hich he

State elections officials last

petition signatures — 1.584
more than they needed to place
their proposal on the ballot.

" T h e y ’ ve (pro-casino forces)

months and have put a lot of
money Into It.... Our money has
been limited and our time has

Turlington has been vocally
opposed to the casino Initiative
throughout his own petition
drive. Insisting there Is a big
d iffe r e n c e b e tw e e n lo tte r y
wagering — which Is allowed In
22 states and the District of
Columbia — and casino wager

and Atlantic City. N.J.
"T h e (casino) amendment be

potentially destructive of the
best Interests o f the state than
the am endm ent w e had in
1978," Turlington said.
The 1978 amendment would
have allowed casino gambling

Miami Beach to Hollywood. Fla.
T h e current proposal would

In the end. the House and Senate adjourned

end. Congress did what it seem s to do best
these days, tem porize w h en it cannot decide

A C ongress that could not m anage its

Congress suffers from m any ills: Uninspired

Semantic Baloney Clutters Political Dialogue
Senator Kennedy's decision not to seek the
presidential nomination has provoked a rash o f
speculation about the future o f the Democratic
Party. Several commentators have suggested
that Kennedy's withdrawal means the end o f the
old Democratic order and the emergence of a
dramatically new agenda.
According to this thesis. Senator Kennedy
represents a tired liberalism that included a
belief that government has a special obligation
to help those In trouble. Kennedy-type Demo
crats respond to the challenges of the unem
ployed. hard-pressed farmers, the aged and the
victims of discrimination and Injustice. I have
always regarded this kind of government as a
political application of the Judeo-Christlan
ethic. Now it Is said these values will be replaced
by a new brand of Democratic pragmatism
responding primarily to the needs of the more
competitive, more richly endowed upwardbound citizenry.
I am skeptical about all of this. To me it
includes a sizable amount of shadowboxing with
vaguely defined labels. It is always better to
evaluate a politician and a political proposal on
their merits rather than with assigned or
claimed labels.
In a sense, political writers and commentators
sometimes use labels as an easy way of putting
a public figure into a neat category, so that It is
not necessary to evaluate the politician's
positions on the hard issues of the day. This
labeling technique assumes that the public la
incapable o f Judging public figures and their
proposals on their merits. The label-mongers
are. In fact, condescending toward both politi
cians and voters.
Depicting Ted Kennedy as an old-fashioned
politician who Is now out of step with the new
age Ignores the fact that he has constantly
demonstrated more youthful independence of
the established order than some of the supposed
new challengers who seem to be guided by
timidity, opportunism and a passion for the
techniques o f public relations.
If we can get away from such labels as "old
iitw-rais." "neo liberal* " “ m-n conservatives —
"n ew Ideas.” "progressive pragmatism" and all
the rest of the semantic baloney that now
clutters up our political dialogue, it will he much
better for the cause of common sense and public
understanding. It might then be easier to
evaluate candidates for the presidency on the
basis of brains, leadership records and platforms
Instead of labels and Image manipulation.
I believe the senator when he said that one
factor in his decision not to seek the presidency
Is that candidates are increasingly evaluated on
the basis of such superficial analyses as whether
they are moving right or left instead of whether
their efforts and their stands on public issues
make good sense.
I have believed for many years that such
labels as "lib eral” and "conservative” arc
obsolete In today's world.
Was It liberal or conservative to oppose our
d isastrou s, in c re d ib ly c o s tly blunder in
Vietnam?
Was it liberal or conservative to stand up to
the bullying tactics o f the miserable demagogue
Joe McCarthy in the 1950s?
Was It liberal or conservative to Join in the
civil rights movement of the 1960s?
Is it now liberal or conservative to work
toward an end to the nuclear arms race?
Is it liberal or conservative to protect the
environment?
Is it liberal ot conservative to compensate
hard-pressed Am erican faun families more faifly~
for their production and to use that abundance
more imaginatlv :ly to end human hunger?
Who should be most concerned about the
monstrous Reagan deficit and the even more
monstrous deficit we will have tr he is allowed to
proceed with the nonsense of "Star W ars" —
liberals or conservatives?
It Is these questions — and others like them —
that address the Issues that cry out for
thoughtful, tough-minded answers, not the
shilly-shallying that now seems to be the order
of the day.
If Senator Kennedy can better address these
issues from his forum in the Senate than as a
candidate for president, he can perform an
urgently needed service for the Democratic
Party and for the nation.

Is Social
Security
Sound?
Something
Nice Said
O f Carter
W ASH IN G TO N (N E A ) - The
Social Security system has devel
oped a new set of problems that
Congress will have to address in
1986.
The first problem, however. Is
actually an old one: Is Social
Security financially sound?
When Congress passed sweeping
amendments to the Social Security
Act in 1983. the Social Security
Adm inistration pronounced the
system sound well into the next
century. But some conservative
critics say that the present system is
still in trouble.
Most Social Security forecasting is
based on assumptions — assump
tions regarding the number of
future beneficiaries, the number
em ployed and paying into the
system, and the future state of the
economy. These assumptions are
as s e m b l e d into op ti m i s ti c ,
p e s s im is tic and in te rm e d ia te
forecasts and the state of Social
Security is predicted under each
different set of assumptions.
In its most recent report, the SSA
predicts continued financial health
for the system far into the future,
under its set of optimistic assump
tions.
H o w e v e r , th e in t e r m e d ia t e
assumptions project a far different
future.
According to these projections,
the baby-boom generation will
reach fu ll e co n o m ic m atu rity
around 1990. and Social Security
will begin to amass a large surplus.
This will become a huge surplus
early in the next century.
But by 2005. as older babyboomers start to retire, this surplus
will be sharply reduced. By 2015. as
the number of retirees increases,
the system will start to run annual
deficits that will accelerate each
year — and by 2049. the system will
be completely out of money.
The Social Security forecast Is
worse even sooner when It's based
oo-lhc-pesslmlsj ic assumptions.
According to this forecast, the
surplus will never materialize, the
system will start to run heavy
deficits by 1995. and it will be out of
money by 2010.
The SSA says there's no reason to
worry. What will actually occur,
they say. will be something between
the optimistic and intermediate
assumptions. Congress may have to
fiddle with rates and benefits some
time around 2010. they say. but
there’s no cause for alarm.
WILLIAM RUSHER
A Pat O n The Back
At the end of the year, some of my
braver colleagues In the column
business have been known to re
view their work product for the year
past and proclaim frankly those
instances In which they went
wrong: made a mistaken forecast or
whatever.
Curious as to my own score. I
recently went back over my 1985
columns and made an interesting
discovery: By and large 1 was very
careful about trying to predict the
future. In fact. I found only one big,
fat, confident prediction, in a midJ an u ary colum n on President
Reagan's second term then Just
b egin n in g . D ism issing all the
speculation that he would in- a
"new Reagan." reversing himself on
a tax Increase and preoccupied with
achieving his "place in history"
through an accord with the Soviet
Union. I placed my bets in a way
thi»t. I must say. reads rather well a
year later:
___________
,TWTiat you saw in his first
administration Is. to a rematkably
large extent, what you'll get In ills
second. The man still thinks the
federal government is much too big.
and will try his best to whittle it
down, or at least diminish its
growth rate. He still thinks tax rates
are too high, and will fight like a
wildcat to bring the deficit under
control by cutting expenditures
rather than raising taxes. He still
considers the Soviet Union ‘ the
focus of evil in the modern world.'
and intends to resist its various
aggressions, direct and otherwise,
by appropriate means. He will keep
right on building up the nation's
defenses, very definitely Including
research on a satellite defense
against ICBMs. At the same time, he
will actively seek reductions in all
existing arms, provided they are
equal, balanced and. above all.
verifiable. He hasn't even changed
his mind about Taiwan.”
On one particular Issue, the presi
dent's conservative critics may wish
to argue that time has proved me
mistaken. In July, defending Mr.
Reagan against charges that he had
"done nothing" regarding the hi
jack of TW A flight 847. 1 argued for
patience:
My review of my 1985 columns
did produce one notable unexpected
bonus: my indisputably favorite
sentence. It turned up in a March
coluinn_.about the Democrats and
the deficit. Recalling how the Dem
ocrats had made the rafters ring
during the 1984 campaign with
their wails about the federal budget
deficit, and noting how. as the
budget was being drawn up. they
were now commiserating with every
Interest group in sight on the
cruelty of Mr. Reagan's proposed
cuts. I concluded: "T h e only deficit
the Democratic Party really gives a
hoot about is the one that showed
up In their vote totals on Nov. 6 ."
That says It all.
It was a comment toward the end
of a lengthy New York Times report
on the aftermath o f the Guatemalan
election that I found of particular
Interest:
"Y ou can't discount the contribu
tion of Jimmy Carter while he was
president. Carter was very firm
against dictatorships, and he helped
to set this process in motion."
The speaker was a candidate for
mayor of Guatemala City, one of the
many civilian leaders In addition to
the newly elected president. Marco
Vln'clo Cerezo Arevalo, who are
beneficiaries of the Guatemalan
army's decision to relax Its 30-year
grip on ihe country's political pro
cesses.
My purpose in calling attention to
this point is not to say nice things
about Carter administration policy
toward Latin America, deserved as I
think that m ight be in many
respects. It Is to point out that the
democratic revival under way in
Latin America has a history, one in
which the United States often has
been intimately Involved. But not
always, as Carter was. on the side of
the democratic angels.
Guatemala Is a particularly good
example. The story of its return to
something resembling democratic
government begins back In 1944.
with the overthrow of a repressive
dictatorship and the election of
Juan Jose Arevalo as president In
the first really free vote in the
country's history. A program of
limited land and labor reforms soon
brought his government into con
flict with entrenched business Inter
ests. local and foreign.
The real trouble didn't begin,
however, until after Aravelo was
su c c ee d e d by J a c a b o A rb e n z
Guzman In another free election.
Arbenz greatly expanded the re
forms and expropriated unused land
of large estates for distribution to
the landless peasantry.
This was a direct challenge to
Guatem ala's largest landholder.
—Am er4«axi.nwneri U n ited Fruit.
The company was not only well
fixed, it was extraordinarily well
connected. It was represented by a
New York law firm in which then
Secretary o f State Jol n Foster
Dulles had been a partner.
None of that may have played a
role in what followed. Arbenz had
amply antagonized Washington In
other ways. He had legalized the
Communist Party in Guatemala and
begun acquiring arms from the
Sovle' bloc.
JA CK ANDERSON
Airport Security Gets Mixed Grades
A me
"Like everybody else, when it comes to Star
Wars, I KNOW it won't work, but I need to
BELIEVE it will."
B y Jack An derson «
And D ale Van A tta
W A SH IN G TO N - More than
1.900 air travelers lost their lives
lust year In hijackings and plane
crashes.
The irony of this tragic record —
the deadliest in aviation history — Is
that It was compiled at the same
tim e the Federal Aviation A d
ministration's security program was
achieving unparalleled success in
delecting and preventing potential
air disasters.
The cornerstones of the FAA's
security system are the X-ray de
vices and metal detectors that were
first Installed 13 years ago. Last
June, agency officials told Rep.
Cardiss Collins. D-lll.. that since
1973 some 31.000 weapons have
been detected and 13.000 persons
arrested. A conservative estimate Is
that 112 h ija ck in g s or other
airborne crimes have been pre
vented.
The price of this enviable record
has been eternal vigilance. This was
pointed up in a still-secret "special
evaluation" of security screening
procedures at the world's busiest
airport. O 'Parc International In
Chicago.
The evaluation was ordered by
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole following the June 14 TW A
hijacking and the bom bing at
Frankfurt airport five days later.
O'Hare was one of 40 airpoits
studied by FAA security experts.
Here’s what the experts found at
O'Harc:
— All the X-ray machines In use
by 23 airlines detected 24-gauge
(very thin) copper wire Inside
carry-on luggage.
— The two. sometimes four, metal
detectors used by the 23 airlines
rated high grades.
— Screening personnel at 16 of
the 23 airlines failed to detect
facsimile dynamite being smuggled
past them. Those who "failed to
recognize the test object (dynamite
bomb)" in the tests, conducted in
late July, included personnel under
the control of Eastern Airlines at Air
Wisconsin. Branlff. Continental.
J e ts tre a m . N o rth w e s t O rien t,
P ie d m o n t and E astern Its e lf.
Screening personnel at three other
airlines under the control of TW A
and three under Delta's control also
failed to spot the dummy dynamite.)
Personnel at American. Frontier.
Jet American. Pan American. Peo
ple's Express. Republic and Sim
mons were able to detect the
facsimile dynamite bomb.
Security experts told our associate
T o n y C apaccio that screen in g
personnel are constantly being re
trained in d yn am ite d etection
because It Is so difficult. They
weren't surprised at the results of
Ihe FAA's July testing.
An Eastern spokesman said the
airline's security specialists, who
reviewed the FAA report, continu
ally retrain their screeners in
explosives detection in conjunction
with F A A efforts. The Eastern
spokesman pointed out that the
FAA had not formally notified the
airline of the July test results,
which he Interpreted as meaning
the federal inspectors did not think
Fastem's detection techniques or
l iining were remiss.
In fact, one security expert told us
he was confident that the screening
personnel who flunked the July
tests would spot the dynamite If a
test were run today.

team takes a lot more than Just firefighting
skills. Participants must have extensive training
which includes taking courses at Seminole
Community College, he said.
Team m em bers gain "b o o k know ledge"
during the first portion of their training. Then,
it's on to some "hands o n " experience through
Instruction at Safety System s Co. in St.
Augustine, where team members learn how to
do everything from plug leaks to contain fires.
Senior members attend the National Fire
Academy in Emmltsburg. Md. where they learn

with and how to actually deal with chemical

ous materials, safety is the key consideration.
. that is. protecting citizens. "W e are dealing with
* extremely dangerous chemicals." he said.
Preparing to do battle with these substances,
the men don their special clothing, called acid
suits, and begin clearing the affected area of
people.
The protective suits are all rubberized, and
the team actually uses three different types of
suits, depending on what type of c h e m i c a l i t wllL
be handling. Johnson said.
The suits are equipped with cooling systems
to accomodate the Sunshine State's sweltering
temperatures. The volunteers also wear a radio
head set for communication purposes and use a
long duration breathing apparatus. The bulky
suits are not be the most comfortable of attire,
especially when combined with the 80-pound
kits the men take with them to chemical
emergencies.
Recently, a 1975 fire pumper was refurbished
into a special response vehicle especially for the
hazardous incident team's use.
Designated
HAZMAT 351. the vehicle was formerly the first
fire engine purchased by the county and
replaced a smaller van the team once traveled
in. Johnson said.
H A Z M A T 351 was put Into service in
November and was used as recently as two
weeks ago. when the team cleaned up a diesel
fuel spill in Forest City, he said.
Johnson called the teams' efforts successful
and said members can clean up as much as 90
percent of the spill from an accident involving
hazardous materials. The team also cleans up
spills involving hazardous waste, the materials
which remain when chemicals are used in the
manufacturing process, he said. The waste is
often more hazardous because It may be mixed
with other chemicals after it is used and could
even become a more toxic substance during
processing. Johnson said.
Hazardous material spills do not occur at an
alarming rate, but the need to be prepared for
the worst is always there because chemicals arc
used every day. he said.
"T h ere arc tons and tons o f hazardous
materials in the county, everything from
heating oils to pcstlcldes."Johnson said. "A
large amount passes through on rail lines and
the Interstate. One 30.000 liquid propane tank
could devastate a large area."
Volunteer teams, like the one In Seminole
County, arc "the rage" in fire services across the
country, but only came of age as recently as
1980. he said.
" A lot of firemen were going into spills, trying
to control them and getting hurt." Johnson
said. "Also, there was a national concern as
toxic waste sites were discovered."
Emergency personnel began applying the
same principles as industry to handle hazardous
materials. As chemical handlers Improved
safety for themselves, they began to do a better
Job of protecting the environment, he said.
"Before they would cover the spills or wash
them Into a ditch or the sewer Just to get it out ol
the way. But this doesn't alleviate the problem."
Johnson said.
The spotlight on hazardous materials has
been a plus for Seminole County's team of
experts. Although it receives funding through
the fire division budget, the team Is also

self-supporting through fees it collects from
companies when a hazardous material is
released. Johnson said. The county commission
has given the team the ability to bill Industry for
Its services and legislation at the federal level
also allows the volunteers to defray the costs of
their operation, he said.
The squad operates on an annual budget of
815.000 Including equipment and training
costs. Cleaning up hazardous waste is an
expensive proposition. Johnson said. The price
lag for an acid suit can range from $10 to
82.500. To date, the team has purchased
850.000 worth of equipment.
Expenses aside, hazardous waste teams nave
become a necessity as counties and cities realize
they "have a problem with spills and want to do
something about it." he said.
"W e are one of the most well equipped and
well trained teams in the area, and we will only
get better." Johnson said.
Still, the average person may not be con
cerned with hazardous materials "until they
wake up and someone says It's In their
backyard. Then it hits home." Johnson said.
"It's not something that many people think
about." he said- until disaster strikes. In a
neighborhood, or Just around the corner.

Britain Sees The End Of Two-Party Rule

LONDON (UPI) — If Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher were to start the
new year by calling an election, she
would not win. Neither would anyone
else.
Year-end public opinion polls confirm
that Britain is no longer a two-party
country. Its voters are now split almost
precisely In thirds.
All year the polls have shown three
groups — which paradoxically com
prise four political parties — see-sawing
around the 33 percent mark. Tiny
swings are thus magnified in im

N e w C oaches V o w To C h a n g e Sem inole's Tennis Image
There are some outstanding high
school players and teams In Seminole
County this year. During the next
several weeks this column will focus
In on some of these teams and their
players.
The season is Just around the
corner with most o f the teams
starting official practice the first week
In January and thH r acainns-catly-luFebruary.
Here’s a look at Seminole Nigh
School:
Seminole has never been known for
Its tennis teams. The Semlnoles excel
In track and often Held strong teams
In basketball, baseball and football.
Tennis has sort of taken a back
seat. I get the distinct feeling, though,
that this Is slowly but surely chang
ing. Principal Wayne Epps said he Is
Interested in having com petitive
teams In all sports and is making un
effort to help the tennis program
grow.
This year he hired a couple of
enthusiastic and energetic young
roaches to help give the program a
big boo?! and get the tennis team on
the right track toward being competi
tive.
Joe Dalton and Mark Rost' are the
new roaches. Both of these young
men . i p - s u n i r n i s at Seminole Coin
munity College and are very experi
enced players. They bring a very
optimistic approach to the Seminole
program and have already been hard
at work getting the team organized
for the season.
Dalton is r. graduate of Lake Mary
High School. He was All-State and
All-South a: laike Mary In soccer as a
goalkeeper. He Is a tournament level
tenuis player and Is eager to get on
with ihe building of a solid program
at Seminole.
required of the players to have a
successful season.
On the boys side, this looks like the
best team Seminole has had In recent
years. Matt Albert Is a superb athlete
and knows how to fight and stay In
the match. John Ludwig Is one of the
most improved players In the county.
Ludwig has unlimited potential and

Collins Gets
Indirect Piece
O f T ic k 8' Hit
Jerry Collins, chairman of the
board of the Sanford-Orlando
Kennel Club, has been whistling
a happier tune the past few days.
One would think he’d won a
million dollars or something.
Actually. Collins didn't win a
million bucks but he will realize
the benefits of someone who did.
Monday night at the Tampa
Greyhound Track, an anony
mous bettor correctly picked the
Pick 8.
That’s Pick 8 as In picking the
winners consecutively from the
fourth through the 11th races.
That’s exactly what someone did
ut the Tampa track and picked
himself up a cool S 1.127.268.
The man reportedly spent
S400 to finance his project.
Collins, meanwhile, doesn't get a
piece ol the action. Not directly
anyway. But tin* lure of the
Tampa track has lessened con
siderably. which means more
patrons for SOKC's track which
opened last Thursday.
'll was a nice post Christmas
present." Collins said Tuesday
night "Five ol Hi* eight dogs
that won are racing lor ns. Three
ol them will lie coming here and
two are going to Sarasota/'
Lake Mary's Rod Connell had
the fourth race winner with
Angie Doodle. Henry T Wright's
Wright Hopper won the ninth
rat e and Dan O’Connor s DCs
Glenn completed the l’n k H by
winning the I lib race. All will
t ome to SOKC when the Tampa
season ends Saturday.
.. . Barnes Has Touch
Tom Barnes didn't win a
million dollars but he has a
priceless girls' soccer team,
liarnes. who guided the Lyman
Lady Greyhounds to a state
championship last year, has his
young ladies on the road to
repeating tills winter.
it's a tough task to pull olf
back-to-back cham pionships.
Just look ut the NBA. It hasn't
had consecutive titles since the
Boston Celtics did it In 1968 and
1969. And there have been a
bunch of good Celtic. Laker and
76er teams during those 16
years.
If someone has the guiding
touch for a repeat performance,
however. It would be Barnes. He
takes a low-key approach to his
coaching which doesn't cause
Ills gltls to tighten up. He's also
a coaching gentlem en, who
never runs up the score or runs
clown the competition.
And believe me. with the
talent Barnes' has on Ills team, it
lakes a delicate hand to know
when to pull off the starters.
Sute. Lyman has a lot of
talent, but talented teams have
come and gone without champi
onship. Barnes knows how to
harness that talent and motivate
it In the right direction.
He does all o f this while
handling the sometimes ticklish
situation of having his daughter.
Alysou, on Ijie team. too. Of
course, Alysou helps matters by
being one o f his best players.
There is never a discouraging
word heard about favoritism

ence. Paula Volpl Is a strong player
but the supporting cast Is woefully
Inexperienced.
Some, in fact, have never played a
match In their lives. Seminole girls
participate in many, many activities
— tennis Is only one of I hem and
often takes a backseat to other
things. The very strong teams In the
area - have tennis -players who hav » tennis as their main Interest and
work at It accordingly.
Seminole will be young. Inexperi
enced but spirited and hard working.
Kim Maehnik. Lori Swain. Jennifer
McKlbbln and Kelly Castle will prob
ably round out the squad. This team
has potential. All are young and
athletic. If they can find the time to
work at their tennis they could
surprise some folks.
Overall this Is a tennis program on
Its way up — best wishes for a good
and fun season.

Rams are prepared to stick with their "eight-play

But If his limited offense was good enough for

Robinson figures why change.
“ If there's a strategic reason for it. you might
use something new." said Robinson, who has led
the Rams Into the playoffs In all three of his NFL
seasons "T h e re are teams with a certain
personality that like to try that. Dallas is one.
They won't change their offense or defense but
they will try new plays.

anything different. We fall Into that category."

Hurricanes Set Springboard For No. 1
NEW ORLEANS (UPI) - The Miatpl
Hurricanes can vault from No. 4 to No.
1 after Wednesday night's Sugar Bowl,
but their game against No. 8 Ten
nessee Is only part of the equation that
can bring them a second national title
In three seasons.
“ I think we should be In the top
three now and should be No. 1 If we
w in." said Miami tight end Willie
Smith, who will be playing with 18
stitches In his right hand. " I f we go out
and have a good game and come away
with a win. and Oklahoma wins (over
Penn State In thr Or?ng- BrwU.-Mhlnltwc should be voted national champi_ . ••
ons.
The Hurricanes also trail No. 3 Iowa,
which plays UCLA In the Rose Bowl,
but Smith and his teammates think a
convincing victory by them and a win
by No. 2 Oklahoma over No. 1 Penn
State arc the keys to their bid for
another title.
They reason that their 27-14 victory
at Oklahoma in mid-October should
give them an edge in the final voting If
Miami and Oklahoma both win New
Year's night.
"I'v e thought about No. I a little
b it." said Miami quarterback Vinnv
Testaverde. "But our main goal at the
moment has to be to beat Tennessee. If
we don't, being No. 1 is no longer at
Issue."
M ia m i r u n n in g b a r k A lo n z o
Highsmith said there Is a "dllTerent
feeling" this year than there was two
years ago, when the Hurricanes nipped
regular-season leader Nebraska. 31-30.
In the Orange Bowl to win the national
crown.
“ No one gave us a chance to win that
on e." said Highsmith. "Everyone said
Nebraska was going to blow us out.
“ No 1. Is a matter of opinion."
Highsmith added. "Our situation in
'83 was very similar to this year (both

loss to Florida and then won the rest of

Hope To Sever
Rose Bowl Jin x
PASADENA. Calif. (UPI) Entering today's Rose Bowl,
third-ranked Iowa must feel like
Major League Baseball's Ameri
can Leaguers heading into the
All-Star game.
The Hawkeyes will be out to
prove to the nation the Par-10
can't be that much better than
the Big Ten. no matter what
Rose Bowl history shows. Pac-10
representatives have won the
last four Rose Bowls: 10 of the
last 11.
Iowa lost 28-0 to UCLA three
tyears ago. and head coach
•Hayden Fry is quick to point out
how much that loss still bothers
him.
“ Last time, we wanted to go to
the Rose Bowl and we did." he
said. "This time, we wanted to
go to the Rose Bowl and win it.
There's a helluva big difference.
"W e would like to amend our
p re v io u s p erform an ce, and
particularly the score: 28 0. It
has bothered me since the year it
happened. Without question, we
will be a better football team."
Fry didn't bring his team to
California until Thursday. In
1982 the Hawkeyes came out
Jan. 19. To make up for it this
time, they will stay 48 hours
a f t e r th e g a m e to e n jo y
themselves. Until now. Iowa
players haven't had much fun.
"I allowed them to bring their
own cards and checkers.” Fry
said.
Iowa takes a 10-1 record Into
the 72nd Rose Bowl, and UCLA
is 8-2-1. The Bruins have won
their last four Rose Bowl appear
ances since 1966. including two
in the last three years.
Although No. 1 Penn State
plays No. 2 Oklahoma in the
Orange Bowl. Fry thinks his
team deserves consideration for
the national title if it wins.
"There are so many variables,
that's why it's Impossible to
know who's No. 1." Fry said. "I
don't put value on polls. They're
not realistic."
Nonetheless, it would take a
strange set of circumstances for
Iowa to emerge as the topranked team.
When asked how Iowa can
finish No. 1. Fry said. "If all the
guys (who vote) abstain the
night before they cast their
ballot."
Fry Is one of 42 voters in the
UPI coaches ratings.

"Testaverde will be awfully difficult

JACKSONVILLE (UPI)
In
most o f the old westerns, the
cowboys always got the best o f
the Indians, but It was not to be
that way Monday night in the
Gator Bowl.
The 16th-rankcd Florida State
Scmlnolcs took the firepower o f
the Oklahoma State Cowboys —
Thurman Thomas — and hurled
projectiles to claim a Cowboy
scalp to take hack to their
wigwams
The chief Seminole. Bobby
Bowden, said he had decided
before the game tht his team
would ply their fortunes through
the air.
"W e decided we were going to
pass, whet iter we had any re
ceivers nr not." Bowden said
a fie r the S em in oles* 34-23
thrashing of the 19th-ranked
Cowboys. "I was really proud of
the whole team, hut if I had to
pick out any group that did a
particularly good Job. It'd have
to be the receivers."
But the Seminoles also showed
they could stampede the C ow

rushed for 201 yards on 24
carries.
"I wanted to sec Just what I
could do." Smith said in the
Jubilant Seminole locker room.
"I'd had a little lough time the
last few times out and I Just
wanted to redeem m yself for the
team ."
Chief among the Seminoles*
w e a p o n s w a s fr e s h m a n
quarterback Chip Ferguson, who
stepped In in mid-season (o fill-in
for an Injured Eric Thomas.
Ferguson filled the air with
footballs all night, connecting
wilh his corps of receivers for
338 yards and two touchdowns.
But Ferguson said the team
had a "higher objective" In mind
coming Into the game.
"W e kind of dedicated this
game to Hassan." Ferguson said
of Seminole standout wide re
c e iv e r H assan J o n e s , w h o
Bowden suspended from the
team for selling his complimen
tary tickets. "Our other reclevers
stepped right in and filled his
shoes. They did a bang-upjob."
Across the field, in the somber
quiet of the Oklahoma State
dressing room, head coach Pat
Jones said the Seminoles am
bushed his Cowboys.
"Florida Stale was better than
we expected." Jones said. "They
came out firing at us and threw
the ball more than we expected.
Everything was belter about
them than we expected. They
Just whipped us from every
angle."

MIAMI (UPI) — A former police officer of Ihe month waa
denied bond Tuesday on drug trafficking and racketeering
charges, one day after he turned himself in to homicide
detectives.
OfTlccr Rodolfo Arias and five others arc accused of
~parTtc!pa»n'g Tn~'a~ schcm* prosecutors call "T h c Errterprlse" that ended when three drug smugglers were
drowned in the Miami River.
Police say there may be more arrests in the case.
Arias. 29. was denied bond by Dade County Circuit
Judge Leo Adderly. Defense attorney Jay Levine said he
would appeal the denial.
Goorgla Ex-Con Back In Ja il
NAPLES (UPI) - An ex-convict from Georgia Is back
behind bars after he hijacked a tractor-trailer loaded with
30.000 pounds of flammable Insecticide chemicals on
Interstate 75 early Tuesday by threatening to shoot the
driver and his wife, police reported.
Bobby Thomas Crews. 44. of Macon. Ga.. was ordered
held without bond In the Lee County Jail on two counts of
kidnapping.
He was arrested when 20 law enforcement officers.
Including a SW AT team from the Lee County sheriffs
office, forced the truck over at the Bonita Beach Rd. exit on

Halt Drunk Driving Drlvo Palling
MIAMI (UPI) — A drop In the number of drunk driving
arrests In South Florida In 1985 below those of 1984 — and
possibly 1983 — Is directly related to police's handling of
the problem, a published report said Tuesday.
Despite a three-year campaign to rid South Florida
highways of motorists who have had too much to drink,
the total number of 1985 drunk driving arrests appears
certain to fall below last year's total of 9.195 and may drop
below the 1983 figure of 8.961. the Miami News said.
Complete December figures are not yet in.
Police records show the drop-off Is not linked to simply
having fewer drunk drivers on the roads. It is related
directly to a shift in police procedure that has forced
regular patrol officers to become "do-it-yourself* breath
technicians.
Baby Dies In Miami Fire
MIAMI (UPI) — Miami firemen found the body of a
15-month-old baby bov still In his crib In the aftermath of a
one-alarm fire in a baystde area less than two miles from

revelers.
The baby boy. 15-month old Luisito A. Ramos, and his
brother Jose Ramos. 3. were alone in the house at the time,
said Miami Fire Department spokeswoman Cristv
Hickman.
The 3-year-old was able to escape the burning three-unit
building. He was transported to Jackson Memorial Hospital
and treated for possible smoke inhalation, she said. A
hospital spokesman said he Is in good to fair condition and
suffered no actual burns.

LONDON (UPI) - Two armed

Viewers who knew anything
about the attack, or about sever

special police number.
More than 2.000 telephoned

"W e have 20 Incoming lines

said Ritchie Cogan. one of the

"T h e success rate has been

"People are often reluctant to

Pair Seek To Honor
Older Women In 1986
B y Sandra L . Latim er
Sandy Good, a divorced mother
who owns her own business.
Isn't afraid to say she Is 46 years
old. And. she says, as the first of
the post-war baby boomers hit
40 In 1986. it’s time older
women are honored.
Although she's not wearing
rose-eolored glasses, on any day
Good Is likely to be wearing a
button with bright raspberry
letters proclaiming 1986 as the
'Year o f the Older Woman.'
Good and long-time friend
Barb Nielsen say their push to
name the year In honor of
ovcr-40 females Is an attempt to
dispel the historic misnomer of
middle age and a tribute to
women who don't feel old at the
age of 40. ,
The two recall helping a friend
celebrate her 40th birthday and
remembering how depressed she
fell while they were feeling so
good about themselves, said
Good.
“ That's when we decided to do
something about It." she said.
"A few days later the idea was
still there, so we did something
about it."
Their Idea Is to show that
women over the age of 40 can do
w h a te v e r they w an t. T h e y
quickly point to actresses Jane
Fonda. Linda Evans and Joan
Collins as examples.
That celebration package in a
bright pink sack Includes a
purple streamer, a bag of confetti
and a button proclaiming 1986
the year of the older woman.
Good and Nielsen are pretty
good examples of older women
doing their tiling
Both were married voting,
returned to college when their
children went to school, changed
co u rse o f stu d y and w ent
through divorces.
Good says when she was

But she had some good In
formation from her father.
"H e told me to fill my bag so
I'd have a lot to choose from."
.she said----------------------------- -—
Good had a merchandising
background and now owns her
own advertising agency. Nielsen
began as an art history major,
had a banking background and
now sells specialty advertising.
The two have even formed a
business — Older Women Un
limited — to market novelty
Items for their proposed celebra

coffee mugs, sun visors. T-shirts,

Dear

It was not a matter of mixing

read. "Happy Jogging, (then his
name)." He died the next day.
This same idiot niece sent me a
10-quart kettle! I have no Inten
tion o f openin g a boarding
house. I can't Imagine where she
got the Idea that I could use
anything like that, as I am a
widow and live alone In a small
condo.
I know It isn't proper to look a
gift horse In the mouth, but why
In heaven’s name do people send
such Inappropriate gifts?
If they haven’t the time to

something useful, a gift certifi

much more appreciated. Thank
you. I feel better now.

jjTips For Home
\Entertaining
Many of us frequently find
fourselves entertaining friends
•.‘ and relatives at home.
•i Whether you entertain a lot or
{a little, here arc some useful tips
I from the National Hot Dog and
jSausagc Council In Oak Brook.
<111.. that can help you add a
ifcstlve touch to any special
'ocacaslon.
• Fran Altman of the Council
'advises using several different
iklnds of sausage to make up
•tasty and colorful hors d'oeuvres
-ahead of time.
- One Idea: Make a "sausage
•Vomucopla." Roll up one half
jsllcc of salami or hard summer
•sausage in a funnel shape and
-Insert a toothpick through the
middle. Using a pastry tube,
squeeze softened cream cheese
Into the center. Refrigerate until
ready for use.
Or. for a variation, insert a
piece of American cheese to form
a bell or hide a small smoked
sausage Inside. Hot dogs may be
sliced and warmed In a sauce of
spicy salad dressing and served
hot or cold on toothpicks.
For the main course, add
sausage as an ingredient to pep
up special dishes. Bits of Italian
sausage or pork sausage will
spice up bread stuffing. Thin
slices of summer sausage or
salami will turn an ordinary
salad into an antipasto.
When your entertaining Ine lu d e s s e r v in g w in e w ith
sausage, here's a handy list of
suggested wines that comple
m ent the different types o f
sausage. With smoked, country
s a u s a g e s e rv e P ln o t N o lr.
Cabernet Sauvlgnon or any
other dry red wine,
v If Braunschwclger or liver
sausage Is on the menu, the
wines should be cither Camay
Beaujolals or Chianti.
For Bratwurst. serve a very
dry white wine or Riesling.
For Kiclbasa lovers, you ’ ll
want to serve one or more of the
following: 1) French Columbard,
2) Grey Riesling. 3) Gamay. or

Talc comprises 2.2 percent of
Turns. I have been told by a
manufacturer's representative
that starch, talc and small
quantities of mineral oil are used
in the compounding process to
help Turns' ingredients stick
together. I have been assured
that the talc is harmless and is
added only to enhance the phys
ical characteristics o f Turns.
Those readers who are con
cerned about the potential con
sequences of talc in Turns can
contact the manufacturer for
further i nformation: N orcliff

There Is a better psychological

Gcxidrldgc said Andre lost 29
pounds because of the hunger
strike, but now appears to have
gained all his weight back, and
then some.
*‘Hls’ health Is excellent, abso
lutely top notch.” Goodrldge
said. ” 1 think he's gained all that
weight back already and maybe
more, and It's not on what I’m
feeding him so he must be
catching food himself.”
It's on those little side trips
that Andre gets into trouble.
Goodrldge said. There is little
fishing out of Roekport Harbor In
the winter, but the fishermen
down the coast in Rockland
sometimes gel annoyed at the
seal, who likes to Jump In their
boats and grab their oars.
" I f he'd leave the fishermen
alone he'd be all right, but he
gets into mischief by hanging on
their oars." Goodrldge said. *‘I
got one complaint recently from
the Coastal Warden about him
grabbing some guy’s oars, and
I'm trying to take steps to keep
him from doing that.”
The steps. Goodrldge said.
Include feeding Andre every
morning from the Roekport pier
to try to keep him closer to
Roekport Harbor and out o f the
hair of the fishermen.
But Andre wasn't at the pier
Tu esda y m orning, amd
Goodrldge said the seal doesn't
always listen to him.
" N o t when h e ’ s f r e e . ”
Goodrldge said. "Then he pretty
much makes up his own mind.”
Goodrldge found Andre when
he was an orphaned pup. During
the summers. Andre stays In a
pen in Roekport Harbor, and he
and Goodrldge entertain the
tourists every evening. In recent
winters, Andre has gone to
aquariums, but this time the
seal seemed listless and home
sick.

Peace Corps Mature At 25
UFI r u t i n W riter
WASHINGTON (UPI)
— The Peace Corps at
25 Is older, smaller and
more In tune with the
free-entcrprisc spirit of
the Reagan years, but
It Is also quietly thriv
ing. Knocked by critics
In the turbulent 60s
and 70s as a "layover
on the mad to maturi
ty " and a haven for
draft-nvolders. the vol

now lures ambitious

and mid-career pro
fessionals.
The over 50-set Is
sig n in g up heavily,
comprising 11 percent
o f new trainees fgr
1985. When Lillian
Carter was a volunteer
in India during the late
‘60s, that figure was a
mere 1 percent.
"W e're on a roll."
s a y s L o re t M ille r
Kuppe. 49. current
director of the Peace
Corps. "People of all
ages look at It as the
last great adventure."
H o w e v e r , the
number of volunteers
stands at about 6.000.
less than h a lf th e
number of the agency's
peak years. Kuppe attrib u te s
the
low
number to deficit-era
budget constraints.
Many recruits are
still wide-eyed Idealists
on lire to change the
world, hut In the 1980s
they also want to know
"what's In It for m e?"
"W e call them
'r e a lI s le id e a lis t s '
uo w . " cont i nue s
Kuppe. director since
1981. "They are very
in terested in 'w hat
does the Peace Corps
experienee mean to the
rest of mv professional
life.?'
Some 100.000 Amer
icans requested in
form ation from the
Peace Corps last year,
and 3.400 were re
cruited. The average
age has climbed from
2 3 to 2 9 . a n d
m inorities make up
nearly 8 percent of the
force.
"W e now represent
th e di v e r s i t v o f
A m e ric a — c o lle g e

workers, science

Wh e n t he P e a c e
Corps made a plea last
January lor agricultur
alists to help with food
production in Africa,
more than 20.000 peo
ple responded. Urban
planners and computer
experts are also being
courted.
That's a switch from
tile early days when it
was largely young,

"W e don't want any
one who Is running
away from anything —
this Is too g re a t a
c o m m i t m e n t , ” says
Ruppe. "W q tell them,
'you think your pro
blems are bad in this
c ount r y, wai t until
y o u 'r e in a rem ote
village.*"
Once you’re in. you
can only get kicked out
for "politics, pot or not

says Ruppe.
Volunteers, who are
paid an average living
allowance of $250 a
month, go through 12

cultural nuances.
The government also
banks $175 a month
for each volunteer, ad
ding up to a $4725 nest
egg at the end o f 27
months of training nnd
service.
Unlike during the
Vietnam years, the
Peace Corps has big
fans In Washington.
Congress passed and
President Reagan re
cently slgnad a bill
allowing the agency to
grow to 10.000 volun
teers by the year 1990.

The slogan o f the

paralleling R eagan 's
devotion To capitalism.
"C ou n tries like
Tanzania are telling us.
'we need volunteers
with accounting and
bookkeeping skills to
train our villagers.” '
says Ruppe. who has
visited 44 of the 61
host nations.
" O n e of ou r b ig
challenges of the future
Is small business dev

and business majors
are being recruited to
go overseas and work

All of this Is a far cry
from the beginning.

PASADENA. Calif. (UP!) — A million people jammed the
route of the 97th annual Tournament of Roses Parade for
_ an eyeful o f marching bands and dazzling floral floats that
~ w as marred by a record number of arrests and a bomb
scare.
Police tinrerr'a renud 481- n n rsts — most for public
drinking — during the nation's largest parade, which also
rang in the New Year Wednesday for an estimated 100
million television viewers. The previous record was 350

Police blamed warmer than normal temperatures for the
unusually rowdy behavior of the crowd.
This year's theme. " A Celebration o f Laughter."
attracted everything from the whimsical to the mystical.
One float. "Carpet Capers." featured a toy train carrying
cirrus animals as it careened along a high-speed roller
coaster track.
Kidney Patients Halt D ia ly tit
BOSTON (UPI) — Increasing numbers of patients on
long-term kidney dialysis are choosing to stop the
treatments and die. usually because they arc old or suffer
other medical problems, researchers said today.
Terminating treatment "Is a common mode of death" in
patients receiving long-term dialysis, and will become
more frequent as the population ages and refusing medical
treatment becomes more accepted, they said.
While "agony and difficulty" affect all involved In halting
treatment, the study In the New England Journal of
Medicine found those choosing discontinuation "made
deliberate decisions" after nearly three years on dialysis.
The study, the largest of Its kind, was based on 1.766
kidney patients who received treatment at the center from
1966 to 1984. The doctors found 155 patients discontinued
treatment, accounting fort) percent of the deaths.
Enforcement Failure Charged
WASHINGTON (LTD — Few penalties are levied against
school systems that discriminate against students and
employees because the Education and Justice Depart
ments fall to enforce civil rights laws, a congressional
report says.
"Despite federal court orders requiring the enforeement
of the laws and despite the mandates for enforcement
inherent in the laws themselves, the administration only
attempts to remedy discrimination after enormous pre
ssures are brought to hear upon it by the courts." the
report said.
The subcommittee held hearings in July and September
on civil rights enforcement bv the Education Department.
Weiss said in a statement with the report that the Dillon
County case "and others we reviewed reveal flagrant
examples o! how the administration has derailed civil
rights law enforcement."
Harry Singleton, who headed the OCR since 1981 but left
the Job Tuesday, called the charges "ridiculous.”
Despondency Causes G as Blast
PORTLAND. Ore. (UPI) — A despondent, middle-aged
man whose family recently left him out of fear for their
safety killed himself by igniting natural gas from a line in
his basement, sparking an explosion that demolished three

Six people in the usually quiet neighborhood were
treated lor minor injuries in the New Year's Day blast that
leveled the wood-frame home of Donald Nickerson. 52.
Police later said Nickerson's wife. Stephanie, and their
five children had been taken into protective custody
Sunday night at her request because she was afraid of her
husband and said he had been acting strangely. She said
he had been depressed in recent days.
Two nearby homes were lorn apart and Mayer said at
least 30 to -10 houses in a three-block radius around
Nickerson's home were damaged by the blast.

Customs Appeals Search Ban
MIAMI (UPI) — U.S. Customs officials arc appealing a
Miami iVdernl magistrate's ruling which may nix future
searches of outbound passenger's luggage for drug-related
smuggled money without a search warrant.
U.S. Magistrate Peter Nlinkoff threw out as evidence
money taken from the suitcases belonging to Edgar
Hcmandez-Sala2ar. a Colombian accused of violating U.S.
currency law. NimkofT ruled that a search of outbound
luggage made without a search warrant was not legal.
Nlm koffs ruling is believed to be the first in the country
that strikes at the ability of Customs to do warantlcss
baggage room searches on outbound passenger luggage.
His ruling was Issued last week and was disclosed
Wednesday by Customs officials.
Warantless searches were authorized by a provision of
the Comprehensive Crime Control Act passed by Congress
in 1984. Nimkoff struck down that part o f the law "fo r
vagueness in violation or the federal Constitution.”
Miami leads the country In the amount of smuggled cash
recovered In baggage room searches of outbound pui^cngcr luggage. Guinn said. Seizures exceed 83.7 million each
month, he said.
A man who was walking down
the middle of a road in the rain
bolted when he saw a police
officer.
According to a Winter Springs
police arrest report, an officer on
patrol saw a man in the middle
o f S. Moss Road at around 1:47
a.m. New Years Day. The officer
noted it was raining when the
man saw him and began to run
down the road. When the officer
caught up with the man and
asked him where he was going,
the man continued walking
along the road. When the officer
usked the man for identification
he uttered a common two-word
profanity, then asked him If he
had a similarly described war
rant.
The officer then told the man
to stop whereupon the man
reportedly said "la t e r " and
b e g a n to run. T h e o ffic e r
grabbed him and placed him

Women Of The Year
Some remarkable women made
news in 1985. Their names may not
be household words, but their
actions put them In the headlines.
Some performed extraordinary feats
of braver;' and endurance. Others
were moved to act on principle — or
risked censure to speak out. Several
were exceptionally public-spirited
and civic-minded.
For being botli distinguished and
distinctive, I nominate them for the
following awards:
THERE'S-NO-PLACE-LIKE NOME
AWARD to Libby Riddles, 28, first
woman to win the super-grueling
1.135-mlle dog-sled race held annu
ally In Alaska. The trail, from
Anchorage to Nome, winds through
two mountain ranges and over the
Yukon River, a distance covered by
Riddles and her 13 dogs In a
blizzard-filled three weeks.
T A X P A Y E R 'S - B E S T - F R IE N D
AWARD to Dina Rasor who. as head
of the privately funded Project on
Military Procurement, blows the
whistle on extravagant purchases
by the Pentagon. She's the one who
uncovered the $7,622 coffeepot on
the Air Force C-5A cargo planes.
Her most recent disclosure is that
the new $1.5 million M-2 Bradley
tank may be a lemon: Its armor is
too vulnerable to anti-tank rocketry.
The Army plans to purchase 6,832.
STICK-TO-1T AWARD to Gwen
Kemp of St. Paul who discovered an
intruder in her apartment, chased
him out. Jumped on his car hood
and clung to the windshield wipers
as he tried to drive off. He aban
doned the car and was arrested
nearby.
CLEAN-YOUR-OWN-BACKYARD
AWARD to Miriam GraybofT who
sued her employer, the U.S. Com
mission on Civil Rights, for pay
discrimination. A federal Judge,
agreeing that she was doing the
same work for less pay than two
male co-w orkers, awarded her
$26,000 in back pay. Afterward, she
said: "It took me about five years to
realize that I was actually a victim
of discriminatory treatment by the
very agency created by Congress to
monitor enforcement of civil rights
laws."

"She's got an excellent per

She's a lot of fun to have on the

"A s a young person, sure she’s

"Jamie played extremely well.” Schembechlcr said. "I chided him about (tis

he’d do the same for us.”
Morris, who was named the outstanding
offensive player of the game, broke off five
runs of 15 yards or more to more than make
up for a less-than-lmprcsslvc performance
by Wolverine quarterback Jim Harbaugh.
"W e felt like we could sweep on them and

Harbaugh did not appear to be too
distraught with his day. In which he
completed just 6-of-15 passes for 63 yards.
"Statistics don't mean a damn thing."

Meanwhile, the No. 6 Cornhuskers found
themselves self-destructing in the third
quarter. They committed three turnovers In
the period, which led to 24 Michigan points
and turned an 11-point halftime lead Into a
13-point deficit.
"W e played well for three quarters of the
game, but the third quarter went badly,"
said Nebraska coach Tom Osborne following

New Smryna Jetties, Canaveral Provide Bountiful Bluefish
Few anglers realize that some
of the besl fishing for large

to us In the Sanford area. The
north Jellies at New Smryna and
Port Canaveral both provide hot
action with bluefish over 10
pounds each winter.
The north side of the north
Jetties at New Smyrna Is good
this time of year when there is a
north or northeast wind causing
waves to break Into the Jetties.
Huge bluefish feed In the white
water near the Jetty rocks. Help
less balfish are tossed around by
the waves, and the bluefish wait
below to take advantage of the
situation.
Fishermen should leave their
motors running in neutral, and
toss lloat-diving plugs as close as
possible to the Jetty rocks. If you
throw Into the rocks, simply give
some slack and let the next wave
lloat your plug out and then reel
it back In. The Sea Bee lure is
particularly good for this type of
fishing becuase it withstands the
slashing attacks of the toothy
fish.
It Is often effective to twttch
the lure on top and keep It In the
white water as long as possible.
The bluefish feed near the rocks
and usually will not strike a (lug
far from the Jetties. If twitching
the lure on top does not produce
a strike, simply reel the flu In at
a moderate pace and tmprat

it is a crippled baltfish. *

- " T h c o f f enec did aomr thingt r h u r
the defenae waa the key.” Sw ltser aald.
“Ten y e a n ago we w on the national
championship and I thought w e had a
great defense. But I think this la the
greatest defenae I’ve had.’*
Penn State waa limited to just 267
yards total offense and the Nittany
Lions turned the ball over flve times.
Penn State had gone Into the gam e
ranked third In the nation In turnover
differential with plus 17.
“ W e felt the key would be to force
them to psas and we were able to play
five defensive backs a lot tonight/*
Switzer added.
The No. 2 Sooners had begun the
night ranked in the top two In all four
major NCAA categories during a 10-1
regular season.
The Soonera used the punishing
Inside running of fullback Lydell Carr
— who clinched the game In the fourth
quarter with a 61-yard touchdown run
— and a 71 -yard pass In the first half
from freshman Jamelle Holieway to
tight end Keith Jackson.
"T h is Is a dream come true," said
Carr, who ranked second to Holieway
In rushing yardage during the regular
"Even If Miami

(Fla.) would
have beaten Tennessee In the Sugar
Bowl, we would have been the No. 1
team In our hearts.
“Our offense was frustrated with our
first-half performance, but our defenae
Pootball/Orange
was tremendous for the whole game.
W e guys on offense felt we weren't
carrying our share o f the load but we
got things going In the second half."
Carr said.
“W e knew the fullback plays up the
middle would w o rk because they
wanted to stop Jamelle ... they had to
stop Jamelle,” Carr aakl. “Penn State
had a good, solid defense, hut not as
physical as N ebrask a and S M U ."
Holieway found Jackson on a deep
post pattern with the Soonera facing a
thlrd-and-24 early In the second
period.
"W e caught them In a blitz and I saw
Keith open dqwnfleld. He simply blew
past their coverage.**
Jackson said, “T h ey were In

"O u r defenae waa playing extremely

“ Jamelle learned some humility
tonight, but he made some big plays,"
Switzer said.
Sw itzer Im proved hla record as
Sooner head coach to 128-34-4, tying
him with Bud Wilkinson. He said he
thought about It going Into the game.
“1 knew by goOy that fete had
something to do with It.
“W e beat the second-best team In

Aggies Stack Up Auburn
DALLAS (UP1) — For much of Its 50-ycar
history, the Cotton Bowl has been known as
a p a s s er's p a ra d ise and a ru n n er's
nightmare.
Texas A&M sophomore quarterbark Kevin
Murray and Auburn's llelsman Trophywinning tailback Bo Jackson added to that
tradition Wednesday.
Murray threw for a Cotton Bowl record
292 yards while Jackson was stopped time
and again In critical situations when the
game was still In doubt.
Those Ingredients combined to serve up a
36-16 victory for Texas AAM in a game that
was far closer than the result showed.

played half the time she would
have played otherwise."
Whyte said, although her
knees occasionally still give her
trouble, she has a weight train
ing program that Is helping her
considerably.
After playing outstanding ball
in the AAU 14 and under
tournament this past summer,
where she was selected to the
all-state team. Moore thought
Whyte was ready to move tip to
varsity as a sophomore.
"She played really well In the
AAU tournament." Moore said.
"I knew she could handle play
ing varsity. And she keeps
working hard to be more than
Just a tall basketball player.
She's working to he a complete
player and making excellent
progress.”
Whyte said she wasn't sure
about playing varsity at first, hut
she lit right in after she got a few
games under her belt
"I had a feeling I would go up
to varsity." Whyte said "I didn't
think I was ready at first but.
after a couple games. 1 started to
feel good I wanted to show my
teammates l could be on varsity,
not just because of my heighth.
but because I could really do
something to help tin- teat i "
Whyte said her goals
her
sophomore year are to average
15 points and 15 rebounds per
game. And she would also like to
help the team to post-season
success
"1 think were as good or
better than the other teams In
the county." Whyte said. Our
goal is to go to state and. the way
we've been playing. I think we
can do it."
Since she is only a sophomore,
there is a chance Whyte will get
taller bv the time she's a senior
but sbe said she might grow
another inch at the most Al
though she may not grow much
more. Moore believes Whyte has
the potential to develop into a
great player
"There's nothing standing in
her way." Moore said. "She's
going to get stronger in the
shoulders and arms and hands.
And that's something she'll need
to play college ball She's work
ing hard on her shooting and the
form on her shot is improving
She's as consistent around the
basket as any tall girl I've seen "
Moore said Whyte has already
received letters Irom a do/m or
so colleges and one college is so
interested that it is keeping track
of Whyte’s progress \\eekJy
"S h e ’s taken it in a very
mature-ltke way " Moure said of
the college letters "She's look
ing at die letters and responding
to the questional res
Despite her handling of the
attention, the interest came as a
surprise. "I was shocked when I
got the tirsl letter itotn one o! the
colleges." Whyte said. "I'm only
a sophomore and didn't expect it
this soon. I've thought about it.
though, and hopefully I'll get a
scholarship. I saw some college

"This has been the most fun I’ve ever had yards by Hairy Johnson and 22 yards by

wrappings.
Deem Sum. which literally
means "h ea rt's d e lig h t" arc
small delicacies esteemed for
their savory fillings and light,
airy wrappings and coatings.
Depending on the ingredients,
the taste treats can be steamed,
baked, roasted, deep-fried or
pan-fried.
"A person who loves lo cook
w ill find this to be a real
challenge." says Henry Chan,
whose Yank Sing Restaurant In
San Francisco uses the cooking
method exclusively and who has
co-authorcd an authoritative
book on the subject. "Classic
Deem Sum." (Holt. Rinehart.
Winston. $17.95).
The book offers 32 of Yank
Sing’s favorite recipes and in
cludes line drawings on how to
wrap the tidbits. They arc tradi
tionally sold In teahouses from a
rolling cart to diners who pay
the check after counting the
numbers of empty dishes on the
tabic.
Chan said he was reluctant to
do a book on th e d iffic u lt
cookin g form u n til he w as
persuaded It could be done
correctly by veteran cookbook
writers Yukldo and Bob Haydock
of Mill Valley. Calif., the co
authors.
“ I've tried to make It a real
Deem Sum book, one that Is true
to life." said Chan. "O ne o f the
d ifficu lties was to m ake It
applicable and practical for
home cooking. More than half
the w ork Is p rep aratio n —
chopping, dicing and wrapping."

Th e Poughkeepsie Bridge spans the Hudson
River, about 70 miles north of New York
City. The railw ay bridge was hailed when it
w as built in 1IM. Now it's an idle landmark,
The obsolete bridge can be kept as a historic
curiosity, restored for some commercial
purpose, or torn down. In any case, It seems
to be a unique liability.
Historic Span
Is Poughkeepsie Bridge D oom ed ?
and.
B y To m Tlede
POUGHKEEPSIE. N Y. (NEA)
— W hen the Pou gh keepsie
railway bridge was built across
the Hudson River in 1888. It was
hailed as an economic as well ns
an engineering marvel. The
6.767-foot behemoth was the
f i r st d i r e c t l i nk b e t w e e n
Pennsylvania's coal fields and
the energy hungry Industries of
New England.
But what was marvelous in the
last century has become some
thing else in the present. The
Poughkeepsie Bridge has been
largely abandoned by time and
circu m stan ces. The m arket
patterns have shifted, the energy
requirements have changed, and
the railway route across the
Hudson River is no longer re
quired.
Thus the bridge Is idle today.
And. worse, it is disintegrating
In neglect. The structure still
runs In fine majesty across the
water here, like a steel web
stretched by the wind, but the
rails are rusted, the road ties are
warped, and weeds of disregard
are growing out of its stone
foundation.
S o m e p e o p l e s ay
Poughkeepsie Bridge is now fad
ing down.
And no one knows what to do
about it.
That Is to say, no one knows
what to do for certain. The
options are well known but very
debatable. The bridge can be
restored for some commercial
purpose, or it can be torn apart
entirely. In either case, the only
marvel left In Poughkeepsie, an
Industrial river port of about
30.000 p eop le. Is that the
100-year-old span has become a
unique liability.
The liability began, at least
chronologically, when the coal
trade to the Northeast fell into
decline following World War N
The major factories from Rhode
Island to Maine started changing
to cleaner fuel oils at the time.
as
n result,
t he
Poughkeepsie Bridge diminished
in importance.
The owner of the bridge then
was the Central New England
Railway. But the structure was
soon sold to the New York. New
Haven and Hartford system. The
bridge was later peddled again to
the Penn Central Railroad, and it
was eventually acquired by
Conr ai l . t he fe d e r a lly a d
ministered operation.
The last change was the most
fateful. Conrail managers did not
like the rail route over the lower
Hudson. They decided It would
be easier and more efficient to
send New England freight by
way of Albany. N.Y.. to the
north: so the Conrail corporation
closed the Poughkeepsie span
completely in 1974.
The bridge has not been used
since. Neither has it been main
tained to any appreciable extent.
The steel latticework has not
been painted the security fences
have not been kept in order, and
the historic tracks have been
allowed to meander on their
blocks as if they are trying to
break free.
Sometimes they do break free.
Poughkeepsie residents say de
bris is always falling from the
bridge. One resident. Howard
Leroy, says something dropped
right through his automobile
window in 1983.
"It gave me a real shock." he
recalls. " I f it had landed on the
driver's side I would have been
killed."
Leroy believes the bridge is
falling down. And Charles A llano
is one of many others who
agrees with hint. Alfano lives
near the bridge, he also works
fo r th e N ew Yo r k Br i d g e
Authority, and he notes sol
emnly that he is more concerned
with the structure's foundation
than he is with the falling
objects:
"The foundation is eroding.
It's washing away. It looks all
righi from the water level up.
but it's very weak beneath the
surface. I guess the bridge Is
mostly supported by Its suspen
sion now. T h at's not the way it
was designed, and I don't know
how long it can stay up like
that."
At the least, Alfano hopes the
bridge can stay up until a
solution to the dilem m a is
adopted. And that means one of
the alternatives mentioned before.
Some
people
in
Poughkeepsie want the bridge to
be torn down Immediately, while
others insist that it should he
refurbished and put back In
commission.
Preservationists are pushing
for the latter plan. They say that
demolition is out of the question.
They point out that the bridge,
constructed two years after the
Statue of Liberty, is now in the
National R egister of Historic
Places, hence it deserves to
stand and to serve Indcflnltelv.
And actually, that’s Just what
it may do. Because Conrail sold
the bridge late in 1984 to a
private group in Pennsylvania
(for a stipend o f SI). The group
members are anonymous, but
they have let it be known that
they want to repair the bridge
and turn it into an "appropriate
tourist attraction."
The trouble is the group does
not seem to be in a hurry. The
word Is it may take 10 years to
raise restoration funds. Charles
Alfano. for one. says the bridge
may not last that long. The
suspension could hold, he says,
the structure might somehow
hang together, but what if there
w e re an a c c i d e n t ?
An accident? "There are large
barges on the river.” Alfano
explains. "T h e y come up and
down at all hours of the day and
night. 1 worry that sooner or
later one o f the barges is going to
lose its course in bad weather. If
it hits the bridge, well. I think
gravity would take over from
lhere."

Diabetes Can Cause
Nerve Complications
DEAR DR. G O TT - I am a
diabetic and keep my blood
sugar under reasonably good
control. Nevertheless. I have
developed extreme pains In my
feet. My doctor saya this Is
diabetic neuropathy and nothing
can be done. Can you help me?
D E A R R E A D E R — N e rv e
complications of diabetes con
stitute one of the most trouble
some aspects of the disease.
Doctors know basically what
c a u s e s the n e u r o p a t h y o f
diabetes, but they have thus far
been unsuccessful In finding a
.consistent-cure. You, and the
many other readers who have
questioned me on this subject,
will be encouraged to know that
recent advances show great
promise.
Diabetic neuropathy Is now
thought to be due to metabolic
degeneration o f the nerves,
beginning In the actual bodies of
the cells. When glucose enters anerve cell. It Is converted by a
series of chemical reactions to
sorbitol, then to fructose. This
sequence of events Involves the
enzyme known as aldose re
ductase. If too much glucose la
present — as In diabetes — there
may not be enough aldose re
ductase to enable the normal
re a c tio n to pro ceed. N erve
swelling and Irritation may re
sult from a buildup of sorbitol;
finally, the nerve may cease to
function normally.
This nerve malfunction has
been found to occur In up to SO
percent of patients who have had
diabetes for more than 20 years.
The damage may affect both the
somatic and autonomic nerve
systems.
W hen the somatic nerves are
Involved, typical neuropathy*
resu lts. Patients experience
p a in , t in g lin g , n u m b n e s s ,
weakness and muscle wasting.
If the autonomic system Is
impaired, patients will suffer a
w h o le d iffe re n t set o f d is
t u r b a n c e s . T h e s e In c lu d e :
gastric distension, diarrhea,
constipation. Impotence, urinary
retention (because of bladder
distention) and uncontrollable
low blood pressure.
Traditionally, physicians have
advocated control of blood'sugar
to help neuropathy. This makes
sense because, as I noted above,
less glucose means less nerve
swelling (and relatively more
aldose reductase). Weight loss,
attention to diet and the use of
Insulin o r oral an tldlabetlc
agents often help reduce the
severity of neuropathy. Howev
er. good sugar control Is not
always effective. Many diabetics
with painful nerve conditions
require analgesics. Including
narcotics, the side effects of

Insert the nine and West would
be end played.
W ith the actual hand and
actual bidding. South knows
where the spade king Is. (East's
lead-directing double of three
spades was the tip-off.) It's
therefore obvious to declarer
that a spade finesse will fall. But
even without the double, de
clarer. In a five-club contract,
should go right up with the
spade ace. Why?
Opponents' clubs will divide
3-2 almost 70 percent of the
time. So declarer can draw
trumps after winning the spade
ace. play out enough diamonds
to strip that suit from the
East-West hands, and then exit
with a spade. The play can now
proceed as described In the first
paragraph. If East has won the
spade king and leads a heart,
declarer simply Inserts the nine.
Why was It wrong to try the
spade finesse? If East wins the
king and plays a heart hack (the
obvious play), declarer will no
longer be In control and will
need the heart king onslde. In
that scenario West would be able
to win the heart jack and get off
lead with any other suit, even
tually setting the flve-club con
tract.
How did Ihc contract get so
high when three no-trump is a
laydown? That's what often
happens with 32 com bined

T h e L ite r a r y G a ze tte rep orted
Thursday that Soviet research has
centered on scanning the galaxies for

extraterrestrial beings and. at the same
time, sending messages into space.
hi the past. Soviet scientists have
said very little publicly about their
research into possible extraterrestrial
life.
i
"A program wus worked out about a
decade ago for research Into this
problem." the magazine said. "Unfor

program Is being Implemented.”
So far. It suld. "am on g the numerous
signals from the most remote corners of
the universe, there have been none
which could be considered as signals

In a separate report Thursday, the
official Tass news agency said scien

Body
Removed
A t Prison
MOUNDSVILLE. W.Va. (UPI) - A
third Inmate’s body was removed today
from the maximum security West
Virginia Penitentiary where rioting
Inmates still held seven hostages pend
ing a grievance-meeting with Gov. Arch
Moore.
A unidentified body was removed
from the prison in an ambulance and
taken to a hospital this morning.
Authorltes declined to reveal the In
mate's name until relatives could be
notified.
Meanwhile, a woman employee in the
prison's medical services section said
she believes up to 10 Inmates and
possibly more are dead.
" I f they let these guys get away with
this, they ought to fire the whole
administration." said the Wheeling
woman, who declined to give her name.
" I ’m angry about the whole thing.
They (prison officials) knew It was
com ing."
State police Sgt. Larry Henry said it
would be "speculation" for anyone to
say more Inmates were dead.
"W e don’t have any way of knowing
at this time, until we get in there." he
said. "That is something that is being
weighed and considered."
P r is o n s p o k e s w o m a n N a n c y
McDowell said there was no Informa
tion that more Inmates had died.
The seven remaining hostages were
expected to be released today when
several inmate leaders meet with the
governor. But at mid day prison of
ficials said no definite time had been set
for that meeting.
Convicts who took control of the
prison's south wing In a New Year's
Day riot originally took 17 hostages,
but they released four prior to the
signing of an agreement Thursday that
resulted in six more being freed.
Another convict was removed from
the prison after suffering an asthma
attack.
The body of 38-year-old Kent Site,
who* was serving a life sentence for
murder and kidnap, was released early
Thursday. He died o f slash wounds
during the uprising in which 17
hostages were seized when about 200
convicts took control o f the 740-lnmatc
prison at 5:30 p.m. EST Wednesday.
The second dead Inmate, who died of

Lake Mary Delays Vote On Meetings Rules,
Waits To Hear More On Baseball Fields
Lake Mary's City Commission dis
cussed. then delayed a decision on
adopting new rules governing the con
duct of their meetings, which Include a
provision for Informal public "workshop
sessions", until January 16. Also de

cussion of the use of city owned property
. surrounding the new water plant on
Rinehart Road for practice baseball
fields.
The commissioners disagreed with one
point of the new meeting rules resolu
tio n . T h e p r o v is io n for In form al
workshop-style meetings in advance of
each regular scheduled formal session,
held twice monthly, was the center of
conversation.
Commissioner Russ Megonegal said he
was "concerned that something would
be tabled at the workshop, altering Un
published T h u rs d a y night (form al
session) agenda." eventhough formal or
binding decisions cannot Ik- made at a
workshop, according to the rules resolu
tion.
C om m issioner Ken K in g said he
thought the workshops, proposed for 4
p.m. at City Hall each Tuesday prior to
the formal Thursday sessions, should be
held "only when necessary." T o meet in
a workshop to discuss only regularly
scheduled Thursday night material,
"would be a waste of time." King said.
Commissioner Buzz Pcstos pointed out
that the workshops would not necessari

conduct a workshop "should be avail
able" If an Issue In need of in-depth
conversation should arise.

counterpart, Amin Gemayel.
Gemayel traveled to the Syrian capital Thursday to

Lebanon's three main militias to end nearly 11 years of
civil war and establish ways to Implement the agreement.

IN BRIEF
NRC Proposes Major Revisions
In Nuclear Exposure Limits
WASHINGTON (UPI) - The Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission is proposing the first major revision of its radiation
exposure limits in nearly 30 years, saying it was time to
incorporate improved knowledge about radiation's health
effects.
Tiie proposed changes, updating radiation protection
standards first Issued by the agency in 1957. would apply
to nuclear power plants, nuclear fuel manufacturers and all
other activities regulated by the NRC.
The proposals are geared mainly toward safeguarding
nuclear industry* workers by lowering exposure levels for
some radioactive materials — such as uranium — in the
workplace,
Exposure limits for the average American, however,
would remain the same — roughly one-tenth of the
allowable exposure for a nuclear Industry worker. The
revisions are subject to public comment until April 21.
Experts estimate the average American receives 100
millirems of radiation each year from naturally occurring
elements, such as radon gas released from underground
uranium deposits. The average dental X-ray equals about
10 millirems.
Search For Bodies Continues
TORONTO (UPI) — Canadian police plan another search
for victims' remains at the site in Newfoundland where a
chartered DC-8 crashed Dec. 12. killing 248 U.S. soldiers
and eight crew members.
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Chief Superintendent
Dale Henry said Thursday the U.S. Defense Department
asked for the search because pathologists at Dover Air
Force Base in Delaware had trouble Identifying many of the
soldiers killed.
Positive identification has been made on only 102
victims and "w e're hoping this will assist," said Col. Gary
Sorensen of the U.S. Army Military Personnel Center In
Alexandria. Va.
The Arrow Air DC-8 slammed into the ground and
exploded after takeoff from the airport at Gander.
Newfoundland, w’ltere it had refueled. The 248 U.S.
soldiers were on their way from peacekeeping duties In the
Sinai Peninsula to Ft. Campbell, Ky.. for Christmas.
Cabin Fire Caused Crash
DE KALB. Texas (UPI) — The ill-fated plane carrying
singer Ricky Nelson and his entourage made a good
emergency landing with a fire on board and came to a
complete slop before flames consumed the craft, federal
officials say.
Nelson, his fiance and five members o f his band who died
in the accident succumbed to smoke inhalation and bums,
the Dallas County medical examiner's office said.
But. a spokesman said. "It is not known whether they
died before or after the plane" touched ground.
The DC-3 was carrying Nelson and his band from
Alabama to a New Year’s Eve concert in Dallas Tuesday
when the pilot radioed for help — saying that choking
smoke was filling the cockpit — and put the craft down in
rural east Texas.

Reagan: 'Twin Evils' Threaten West
ANGELES (UPI) — President Reagan, head
ing for his fourth meeting with Mexican
president Miguel de la Madrid, says Sovi
et-backed drug trafficking and terrorism
p o s e t o d a y 's " m o a t in s id io u s an d
dangerous" threat to the West.
Reagan will be In Mexico about four hours
today to meet privately with de la Madrid In
the border town o f Mexicali, followed by a
meeting with aides and a formal luncheon.
A f t e r w a r d s . R e a g a n f l i e s b a c k to
Washington.
At the top of the agenda for the meeting is
de la Madrid’s economic austerity program,
supported by the administration. Mexico
faces a staggering foreign debt of $96 billion
and inflation of 60 percent.
Despite the harm to Latin American
stability posed by economic crises, Reagan
said in an interview Thursday with the
Mexican news agcncV-Xoilcla*-de-Me.vieothat communist subversion is the region's
biggest problem.
“ The link between the governments of
such Soviet allies as Cuba and Nicaragua
and international narcotics trafficking and
terrorism is becoming Increasingly clear."
Reagan said.
"These twin evils — narcotics trafficking
and terrorism — represent the most Insidi
ous and dangerous threats to the hemi
sphere today." he said.
A U.S. diplomat who will be part of
today's meeting said Mexico's drug problem
"parallels the beginning o f the narcotics
problem In Colombia'' and could "become a
critical danger" to Mexico's stability.
"That can be something that could bring
them Into difficult straits even before the
economic problems, which we may be able
to solve," the diplomat told reporters at a
briefing in Los Angeles.
The same official said Mexico has not fully
lived up to Its 1962 commitment to make
"structural reforms" in its economy as a
condition of being eligible for more loans
from world lending institutions and U.S.
banks.
—There lias nut been a great deal ~of
movement." said the official, who asked not
to be named. He said some American
bankers are complaining to the U.S. Em
bassy in Mexico City that "th e situation is
not going as well as it should."
But he said Mexico is in no danger of
defaulting and that the United States.

The SEC Issued an order
Thursday censuring Pruden

He said doctors now put her
survival chances at better than
5 0 -50 . but he d e c lin e d to
speculate how much over this
mark. A week ago doctors put
her chances at less than 50-50.
"O n Wednesday she shook her
head 'No' when asked if she was
bothered by the tube in her
throat and if the incision in her
chest was bothering her." Gobel
said, explaining that she has
been gradually coming out of the

days.
"S he is still very fatigued and

Rome Airport Workers
Strike For Protection
By Charles Ridley
. ROME (UPI) — Some 3.000
airport and airlin e w orkers
brought Home's Leonardo da
Vinci Airport to a standstill for
three hours Thursday as they
walked off their Jobs to demand
greater protection against terror
ist attacks.
The brief strike was the first
concerted reaction by airport
employees to the attack last
Friday by four Palestinian ex
tremists at the El Al Israel
check-In counter at Leonardo da
Vinci.
That attack and a coordinated
one at Vienna airport's El Al
counter 25 minutes later left a
total of 19 people dead and more
than 115 wounded.
T h e death toll In R om e's
attack rose to 16 Thursday when

Mohammed Sarham. 19. the
only surviving terrorist in the
Rome attack, underwent an
operation for a bullet wound lu
the leg Thursday at the Cello
military hospital, where he has
been held since he was captured.
Three of his compatriots were
killed when security officers
fired back.

later split with him. claiming
Arafat was too moderate.
Some 3.000 airport and airline
workers at Leonardo da Vinci
walked off their Jobs for three
hours, forcing hundreds of pas
sengers to wait for service. Most
morning Rights were delayed.
The strike and a meeting o f
the workers were called by the
communist-dominated federa
tion of Italy's three mainstream
unions.
Several communist and social
ist politicians attended the m eet
ing. which ended with a unani
mously approved motion calling
for:
—Use of more airport renova
tion funds for security measures.
—Inclusion of union repre
sentatives on the airport's secu-
rlty committee.
—Tightening of controls of
people entering airport build
ings.
After Friday's attack, the gov
ernment ordered metal detectors
set up at the airport entrance
doors.
Airport officials said Thursday
they had received a favorable
preliminary report from a dele

There was a noticeable lack of enthusiasm
on Capitol Hill when Congress approved the
Gramm-Rudman-Hotllngs budget-reduction
plan. Nor was there much rejoicing at the
White House when President Reagan signed
the bill sans ceremony.
T h e som ber m oods at both ends of
Pennsylvania Avenue reflect the blunt truth
that Congress and the president have been
unable to contain a spiraling federal deficit
that threatens this nation's prosperity and its
security. Now. they will be compelled to make
deep budget cuts because of a legislative
directive born of desperation.
Simply stated, the controversial measure
mandates a succession of $36 billion cuts in
the deficit until the budget Is balanced in
1991. The law binds Congress to a series of
budget targets beginning with a $144 billion
deficit ceiling in fiscal 1987.
By Aug. 20 of each year, the Office of
Management and Budget and the Congres
sional Budget Office must Jointly forecast
whether the budget for the coming fiscal year
will meet the targets. If Congress cannot
agree on spending limits to achieve the
deficit-reduction goals, the General Account
ing Office must compile a list of across-theboard cuts. These must be split evenly
between domestic and military programs in
order to bring the budget into compliance
with the target. That list then goes to the
president who. except for limited discretion in
defense and domestic items, must follow it
exactly. Congress, meanwhile, has until Sept.
30 to reach the deficit target by enacting its
own program of budget cuts, tax increases or
a c o m b i n a t i o n o f bo t h. O t h e r w i s e ,
across-the-board cuts commence Oct. 15.
This meat-ax method of reducing the deficit
has been roundly criticized. But the critics
offer no credible alternative. They still believe
that Congress and the president will some
how find a way to bring federal spending
under control. Recent history, of course,
denies this possibility almost completely.
During the last four years, the federal deficit
has risen from $78.9 billion to a staggering
$211.9 billion. This despite a conservative
president committed to fiscal restraint and a
Congress supposedly concerned about the
dangers of deficit spending.
These same lawmakers, however, recently
approved a Labor Department appropriation
that is 12 percent above the president's
budget request. They authorized an Educa
tion Department appropriation that is 20
percent more than the president asked for.
The farm bill is $2 billion over budget. And
the $498 billion omnibus spending act is
laden with pork-barrel projects. In fact, this is
the same Congress that presided over an 11
percent increase in federal spending last year,
despite a robust economic recovery and low
inflation.
If Congress were serious about reducing the
spiraling federal deficit, it would exercise
some self-discipline and. moreover, give the
president a line-item veto so he could make
selective cuts. Instead, the lawmakers have
given him a meat cleaver and limited
discretion as to its use.
Notwithstanding its numerous faults, the
Gram m -Rudm an-Hollings form ula forces
Congress and the president to bring federal
spending it) line with revenues. The law has
been likened to a straltjacket. Inasmuch as it
severely restricts the budget process during
the next five years. Yet. such budgetary
restrictions are clearly warranted, given the
insane spending sprees that have pushed this
nation to the brink of a breakdown.

A higher percentage of the world's people
lived in freedom during 1985 than In any year
since the start of the decade.
But before you get to feeling tod good about
that, listen to the rest of it: An even higher
percentage of people were not free.
The information comes from Freedom House,
the New York-based organization that charts
freedom's gains and losses. It recently issued a
report on the state o f the world press during the
past year that noted continuing restrictions on
the free flow of information In much of the world
and a significant increase in violence directed at
Journalists.
The follow-up survey of political liberties
makes- somewhat more encouraging reading."
While free peoples remain in the minority, the
worldwide trend is In their favor.
Specifically. Freedom House Judged 36.27
percent of the world population to be free In
1985. up from 34.85 percent the previous year.
The only point in the 14-year history of the
survey that free peoples have scored higher was
in 1980. with 37 percent. A few countries then
rated free, according to Freedom House, sub
sequently slipped a bit.
But the free remain runners-up to the not free

With a new year ahead. Ameri
cans are wondering what it will
mean for them and for thler
country.
Perhaps the most encouraging
thing is that there Isn’ t much
pessimism In the land, despite the
existence of tremendous, basic
problems. The mood of the country
is generally upbeat. This is in
pleasant contrast to a few years ago
when recession gripped the United
States. Many people then feared
that the recession would deepen
and become a Depression on the
1930's scale.
One of President Reagan's conti
nuing contributions is his cheerful,
optimistic spirit. He isn't one to be
crushed by worry. His bright spirit
seems to have carried over to the
American people. While recoginzlng
the many problems which exist.
Americans seem convinced that
they can manage them successfully.
A cheerful spirit counts for only so
much, however. National problems
have to be tackled in an intelligent,
responsible way if they are to be
solved. Unfortunately, the man
agement of public business leaves
much to be desired.
On the administration side, things
are stable in the
defense and
foreign p o lic y areas. T h e a d
ministration has stood firm on the
Strategic Defense Initiative and on
n egotiation s w ith the S oviets,
though there have been the usual
pressures to practice appeasement.
Management of domestic matters
has been much less sure, however.
The White House staff failed the
President in pushing the spurious
"tax reform" that was a design for
recession in the year ahead.
The "tax reform" proposed by
Ways and Means Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski would deindustrialize
the United States by destroying
incentives for investment in plant
and equipment. The White House
stand against needed restrictions
on the flood of foreign imports also
has been wrong-headed. The danger
there is a trade-induced recession.
On the congressional side, there
has been unfortunate weakness in
the House of Representatives. The
House has attempted to play a role

which the Constitution doesn't
envision. It also has been reluctant
to come to grips with the necessity
for the United States to live within

WASHINGTON (UPI) - Despite
the great variety of technological
marvels available lo doctors today,
two researchers say there Is one
area in medical practice that hasn't
changed in a century or more — the
physician's record keeping.
Like the practitioner of the 1800s.
the private doctor still records by
hand, sometimes Illegibly, his or her
diagnosis and other pertinent ob
servations during examination of a
patient.
Drs. Daniel Essln and Stephen
Steen of the University of Southern
California Medical Center in Los
Angeles said this traditional way of
keeping records has several notable
weaknesses.
They said In an editorial In the
Archives of Internal Medicine, a
Journal published by the American
Medical Association, that the failure
or inability of doctors to organize
increasingly complex data into a
comprehensive plan o f diagnosis
and treatment "has undoubtedly
resulted in suboptltnal care."
And even If treatment is not
affected, they said such hand
written and often incomplete re
cords "can result In legal catastro
phes."
Essin and Steen said It is the
doctor's responsibility to prepare
and maintain patient records, even
if part of the task is delegated to
others.
Yet. they said. "There Is a com
mon perception, reinforced dally by
practicin g physicians, that the
mechanics of maintaining the medi
cal record are beneath them and
should be relegated lo ancillary
personnel or simply ignored."
As u result. Essin and Steen said,
m ost d e v e lo p e r s o f c om p u ter
systems and medical programs arc
making few attempts to design
systems to help doctors document
their encounters with patients.
"Computer-aided data manage
ment has the potential to resolve the
problems of legibility, complete
ness. rctrlcvabillty and organiza
tion. all of which are so difficult to
accomplish by hand." they said.
Doctors already use computers for
administrative purposes such as
billing, payroll and Inventory con
trol. but Essin and Steen said
physician^ have been reluctant to
use computers for traditional record
keeping.

The tradition Is winning, and no one

Singletary: NFC's Bpst Defender
CHICAGO (UPI| — The Chicago Bears huve had a long
history begun by George "Papa Bear" Halas of refusing to
re-negotlatc contracts for any or their players.
That went for superstars as well as fringe players.
Bui when linebacker Mike Singletary was a holdout at
the start of the Bears* training camp last summer, a red
warning light went out. Chicago could stick to its guns and
let Singletary sit out the season — or agree to his demands.
They agreed.
The fourth-year pro won a "restructured" contract
providing new Incentives, including winning United Press
international's NFC Defensive Player of the Year award, an
honor he won in 1984 and again this year.
Slngletury received 27 votes in 1985 voting while
teammate Richard Dent finished second with 11 points.
Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants was third with
eight points. Wes Hopkins of Philadelphia had six points
while the Bears' Otis Wilson. Dan Hampton and Gary
Fenclk. along with Leonard Marshall of the Giants, had one
point each.

Soviet hockey stick.
Wamsley and his St. Louis Blues teammates dropped a
4-2 decision to the Soviet Red Army Thursday night, and
after the game. Wamsley traded sticks with Soviet goalie
Sergle Miliukov.
"I'm trying to fill a w all." Wamsley said, laughing. "I got
one in Juniors, and I got a couple of others from
international games. I like playing these things (Interna
tional exhibition games).
"Gam es like tills arc always enjoyable to play. There's
not a lot of chipping and stuff like that."
The Blues' Bernle Federko. who scored a goal, agreed.
"There's no fighting." Federko said. "It's all skating.

United Press International
The Detroit Pistons' month

Dailey scored 14 o f his teamhigh 26 points in the last seven

Despite its losing streak, the
Pistons have fallen Just one place

month. The victory was the third
straight for the Bulls, tying the
team high this season.
" I look (for the shot) wherever
they gave me the ball, and It was
Just falling in." said Dailey, who
comes off the bench. " I ’m a
fourth-quarter player, and l get
up when everybody Is playing
well and that's what happened
tonight."
Detroit coach Chuck Daly had
nothing but respect for Dailey.
"Dailey is a tremendous of
fensive player," Daly said. "You
almost have to go to a double-up
(defense) on him. But there Is so
much offensive talent out there,
you Just can't."
Said Chicago Chicago coach

In six words. Georgetown
coach John Thompson said the
proverbial mouthful.
"T h e season Is very, very
long." quoth Thompson.
And seemingly getting longer
all the time.
The Beast of the East last
night fell for the second straight
time. 80-76 to Pittsburgh tn the
Big East opener for both teams.
Is Thompson’s potential dy

"W e're not ready to fold our
tents y e t ." Thompson said,
completing his thought.
Down by 10 with 1:17 to play,
the Hoyas. 9-2. pulled within
76-72 with 42 seconds left. Pitt's
Daryl Shepherd and Joey David
stemmed the charge, however,
hitting two free throws apiece in
the final 20 seconds.
"That was not a fluke win. It
was a good win." said Pitt coach
Roy Chlpman. whose Panthers
Improved to 9-2. "W c played a
tough basketball team. The kids
hung in there and played good
defense. We did a good Job
handling the pressure."
Pitt tortured Georgetown with
its own favorite weapon: defense.
The Panthers held the Hoyas to
4 1 percent shooting from the
door. 34 percent In the first half.
Pitt, playing for the first time
this season In the downtown
Civic Arena, shot 53.4 percent.
62.1 In the second half. Leading
32-30 al intermission, the Pan
thers outscored Georgetown
20-10 over the first 6:20 to open
a 52-40 margin.
" I think Pitt has the potential
lo be a very good team If they
sustain it." Thompson said.
“ Pitt shot the ball very well, and
we didn't shoot as well as we
would have liked tn have shot.
They look us out of our zone

HEARTBROKEN
DEAR HEARTBROKEN: Dee
should not have repossessed the
dress without informing you.
And since she gave you the dress
without making It clear that she
wanted It back, you had every
right to assume It was yours to
keep.
I advise you to call your
sister-in-law and address your
questions to her. Only she can
answer them.

Environmental Group Throatont
Suit To Stop Rapo
TALLAHASSEE (UP!) — A "scheme" to open port of the
fragile Florida keys to development could destroy Florida’s
largest coral reef and threaten endangered wildlife, a south
Florida environmentalistt group has charged.
Susan Cohen, lawyer lor the Friends o f the Everglades,
said a proposed conservation plan that would open part of
North Key Largo to development could kill coral reefs at
nearby John Pennecamp State Park, and would threaten
four endangered species that live on the key.
Cohen said her group would "seriously consider" filing
suit unless Gov. Bob Graham and several state, federal and
Monroe County agencies stop work on the plan.
North Key Largo Is home to four endangered species: the
American crocodile, the Key Largo cotton mouse, the Key
Largo woodrat and the Schaus Swallowtail butterfly.
It adjoins John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, home
of the only living coral reef on the north Atlantic coast.
Socrocy Shroud* Connlo Frond*
MIAMI (UPI) — Secrecy surrounded the condition and
whereabouts today of troubled singer Connie Francis, who
was hauled off to a mental health facility New Year's Eve.
Police went Tuesday to the Grand Bay Hotel to answer a
report that a hotel guest was creating a disturbance. A
Miami fire-rescue unit was requested by police, and
paramedics removed Frahcls. 47. from the hotel at 4:15
p.m. and took her to the Miami Medical Health Center.
Authorities refused to say what prompted the hospital
ization.
•
Health center employees said they could not reveal
whether the singer had been released, admitted 01
transferred, but a supervisor said Thursday night there
was no patient registered at the facility under the names or
Connie Francis or Constance Franconero. the singer's
given name.
Family Of Crath Victim To Suo
PENSACOLA (UPI) — A relative of a soldier who died last
month when a Jetliner crashed in Newfoundland says his
"gung-ho” brother would want the family to sue the firm
that operated the DC-8 — and they plan to do so.
The body of Sgt. Jeffrey Scott Kee. 22. arrived In
northwest Florida under gray skies Thursday morning.
The funeral was scheduled for 10 a.m. CST today with
burial at Barrancas National Cemetery.
Kee was among 246 members of the 101st Airborne
Division and 10 crew members who died Dec. 12 when a
chartered Arrow Air Jetliner flying them home for the
holidays crashed seconds after takeoff at Gander Interna
tional Airport.
Kee. who blamed the Arrow pilot for not having the
four-engine Jet dc-lced during its fuel slop at Gander, said
his brother "was a gung-ho type and he would have said
get 'em and get 'em good and we're going to go after
them."

mission to consider allowing his
group to build up to three
practice baseball fields on pro
perty at the site of the new Lake
Mary water plant on Rinehart
R oad. S u g g s said he had
estimates for fencing, sod, and
grass seed for the three fields,
amounting to $7,807. He said
volunteers were available from
his organization to provide labor
and equipment.
Commissioner Megonegal said
that before a ballfleld could be
put on the land, "massive earth
t^-would have tn hr done
to level the ground. He also
pointed out that a committee
looking Into possible uses of the
land has not yet submitted It's
report and recommendations.
The location m ay eventually be
used for a new city hall, and land
may also be needed for future
expansion of the new water
plant.
City Engineer David L. Wright
said much grading and allow
ance for proper drainage would
have to be given consideration If
a practice m id were put on the
land. He also said there was a
potential for expansion of the
plant, as Seminole County has
made "strong overtures" to
begin preliminary discussion
about entering Into a water
relationship. He Indicated that
the cost of grading the land for a
practice field would be "s u b
stantially more" that the $7,807
figure Suggs estimated. In a July
29. 1985 letter to City Manager
Kathy Rice, Wright estimated
the rough and final grading of
the site alone would be $70,000.
according to his estimates, pro
viding the construction was
done by a contractor.
Suggs said that the league a
fences and backstops could be
removed and reused elsewhere If
the field had to eventually be
moved. "If we had it (the use of
the land) for two years, we would
be taro years better off than we
are now. Kids are better off
playing baseball than walking
the street."
.
Colin Keogh, a former Lake
Mary City Commissioner who
was once a league player, told
the commission that the league
now has 200 children playing In
t-ake Mary on 15 teams, and all
use crowded playing facilities at
Lake Mary Elementary School.
He said that 15 percent of Lake

Fess said further checking into
problems of putting at least one
ball diamond on the water plant
land is needed, and the two sides
agreed to reopen the discussion;
o n the proposal on January 16.
In other commission business,
Dennis Barborka was appointed
to the Board of Adjustment,
replacing Norma Fertakts who)
resigned. Her term was to end;
Oct. 31.1967.
Two bids for Equipment were
also awarded. The city will

from Don Reid Ford for $8,940.
and a backhoe from HoodTractor for $26,357. Both were;;
the lowest bid.

Israel's Oct. 1 raid on the

Israel said It carried out the

attacks and together with the
United States has accused Libya
of backing Abu Nldal. who once

Khadafy Thursday defended
Abu Nldal. saying there are

While on welfare, she took up
odd Jobs. Including a stint as a
beautician In a morgue. In the
early 1900s she drifted to Ban

In March 1964 Spielberg
offered her a part in The Color

But how does a director
motivate an "actor” who falls
to Identify with her character?
"The cat (Spielberg) gave me
a lot of faith." she said. "Plus,
we’re both film fanatics. He
would say something like.

NASHVILLE. Tenn. (UPI) - B.J.
Thomas has no regreta about
going public with his story of drug
addiction, but he concedes It has
posed a problem for. his singing
career.
Thomas, who enjoyed tremen
dous success aa a pop-country
vocalist, waa basically washed up
by the time he waa 30 because of
drug addiction.
But he kicked the habit, became
a born-again Christian, con
centrated on gospel music and
wrote a book about hM experi
ences.
" I personally believe now that
big gospel exposure and the books
and things virtually ended my
music career," Thomas said In an
Interview.
"lt‘a really been a hard struggle
to Just get back to a level and And
an audience for my music. Once I
did this in public. It really kind of
turned a lot of people off — people
I'd like to sing to. 1 have a lot of
Jewish friends and Arabian friends
and when I came out with this
thing they thought B.J. doesn’t
like us any more. ”
But It may go deeper than that
for BJ. (Billy Jo).
"Really It has been a struggle to
overcome some of the
tlons that are put on you when you
do something that has a rrHgkxia

"Most of the sources don't

each person who reported
a b o u t him r e p o r t e d d i f

So she tried to go back to
original sources, to the people
he had worked with, played
with, loved with.
«
"It took me a long time,” she
says, "to find two people to
agree on things. Then.l had to
run everything past dad and if
he corroborated it. then I knew
I had some facta on my hands."
She checked everything she
wrote with her father. He nude
surprisingly few changes. The
main things he deleted, she
says, were references to his
charitable gifts to people. She
says he refuses to talk about
that — that shyness again —
but he dkl let her keep In
stories about his gifts tf those
stories came from the recipi
ents themselves.
She Is somewhat annoyed at
some of the reviews that call
the book “biased." Her point Is
that, with the exception of
some f a t h er - da ug h te r In
timacies. everything she re
ports In the book came from
other people, not from her. So
she believes she cannot really
be accused of bias.
Still, she realizes that the
book Is "a kind of love letter"
from a daughter to her father,
and from dozens of others of
her father's friends and ad
mirers to him. She approached
hundred of those friends and
admirers, asking them for re
miniscences. and most of them
responded.

Hattaway As Lt. Governor?
A ltam onte Democrat Says He's Interested
Beb Hattaway
...may be a a a a d
TA LLA H A S S E E — Democratic guberna
torial candidate Barry Kutun will name his
running mate when he formally enters the
governor's race next Wednesday, and his
choice might be former state Rep. Bob
Hattaway of Altamonte Springs.
If Hattaway is named by Kutun. he will be
the second Seminole Countlan tapped as
running mate by a gubernatorial candidate.
Stale Rep. Bobby Brantley. R-Longwood.
was recently named running mate for
gubernatorial hopeful Bob Martinez, mayor
ofTampa.
Danny Fuchs. Kutun’s deputy campaign
manager, said Hattaway. 49. was definitely
on Kutun's "short list" of potential running
mates. Fuchs said Kutun has trimmed his
list of possible running mates from about 15
names to six.
Fuchs declined to name others on Ihc
"shortlist."
Kutun. 44. a seven term veteran from
Miami Beach who resigned his House seat
this week to concentrate on the campaign,
originally raised money to run for Insurance
Commissioner.
Hattaway. a millionaire developer and
businessman, served in the House from
1974 until 1980. He Is a member of the
Florida Conservative Union and a former
president of the Florida Jaycecs.
Hattaway. who lost a bid for a state Senate
seat In 1982. has been nut of politics since
then. He told reporters Friday that he has
talked with Kutun about the possibility of
running as lieutenant governor: "I've met
with Barry on two or three occasions. I'm
definitely Interested, but I've been away for
u few days, so It's hard to say where he's at.
It's his decision."
Hattaway also said that if Kutun asks him
to Join Ihc ticket. "I'd have to find out what
he wanted from the position." before
deciding.
Kutun began eyeing the governor's race
after Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter,
who had been considered u front runner to
replace Gov. Bob Graham, announced he
would Instead seek re-election, and Attorney
General Jim Smith Iclt Senate President
Harry Johnston's gubernatorial campaign.
Smith, a proven success at statewide
campaigns, was running for lieutenant
governor.
Also seeking the Democratic nomination
Is former Jacksonville Rep. Steve Pajclc and
Sen. Frank Mann. D-Fort Myers.

The flu season hus hit the area
with a vengeance, driving resi

medical centers at double the
rate usually reported during this
time of year.
And. In light of outdoor tem

year.
Central Florida Regional Hos
pital In Sanford also reported
Increased cold and viral flu cases
during the past week, and marke t l n g d i r e c t o r Kay
Bartholom ew attributed the
diagnoses to the wide swing In
temperatures the area has been
experiencing.
According to Dr. David Crane,
sen io r p h y s ic ia n w ith the
Seminole County Hculth De
p a r t m e n t . t h e c o u n t y 's
Longwood clinic has been treat
ing "a lot of Influenza-llke dis
ease." this week.
He said, .however, none of the
cafes have yet been confirmed
through la* tests as being what
the U.S. Public Health Depart
ment classifies as A- or B-type
Influenzas.
"The truth Is we don't know
what types we have going
around, because we don't have
any laboratory reports yet.” he
said. "There arc a lot of private
physicians treating patients, but
even If they made tests they
wouldn't report them to us."
At 925 to 930 a test, very few
people with flu-llkc symptoms
bother to have the lab work
done. Crane said, they Just treat
th e s y m p to m s w it h n o n
prescription drugs and wait for
the flu to run Its course.
Crane said that there are
basically two types of flu-type

three weeks to get over and the

P&Z May Halt Center's Permits
To Alleviate Traffic Problems
By Karen Talley
Herald Staff W riter
Sanford's newest and most ambitious
shopping center provides no bargains in
terms of resident safety, uccordlng to the
city Planning and Zoning Commission,
which may refuse to allow merchants to
open shop at the facility until steps are
taken to ulleviate its traffic problems.
According to the P&Z. declaring a
moratorium on the Issuance of occupancy
certificates for existing, although still vacant
shops, could provide Incentive for the
developers of Seminole Centre, off U.S.
Highway 17-92. to Improve hazardous
driving conditions at the facility.
According to the city's building depart
ment. 19 of the center’s 45 shops are
unoccupied.
The measure was raised Thursday night
during a P&Z meeting which also saw
commissioners refuse to approve a site plan
for additional construction at the centre.
The proposal was made by Heritage Federal
Savings & Loan, which wishes to locate a
facility with three drtve-up windows at the
front of the center, across from Puhlix
supermarket. However, to prevent addi
tional traffic congestion within this area, the
P&Z ruled that the developers would have to
line up the S&L's access routes with the
road located In front of Publtx. As presented.
the plan called for two new access routes to
run across a portion of the centre's north
parking area.
Taking steps to improve traffic slgnallzatlon at all the centre's access roads may
prompt the P&Z ‘ to refuse Issuance of
occupancy permits. Prior to approaching
the city commission with the proposal, the
P&Z will try to meet with the centre's
developers to discuss the situation.
Also, because the P&Z already approved
the centre’s site plan. City Attorney William
Colbert will be asked if the occupancy
permits can legally be denied.
The P&Z. however, contends that the
W ASHINGTON (Ul'l) - U.S.
and Soviet officials may meet
next month to discuss ways to
halt the worldwide spread of
c h e m ic a l w e a p o n s . T h e
Washington Post reported Sat
urday.
During the Nov. 19-21 summit
In Geneva. President Reagan
and S o v ie t le a d e r M ikhail
Gorbachev agreed "to Initiate a
dialogue on preventing the pro
liferation of chemical weapons."
Kenneth L. Adclman. director
of the Arms Control and Dis
armament Agency. Is close to
asking the Soviets to set a date
for the intensified discussions on
rhcmlcul weapons, the Post said.
Adelman told the Post he
believes more than 15 nations
possess chem ical weapons,
compared to five nations in the
1960s.
"The proliferation of chemical
a r m a m e n t s Is g a i n i n g
momentum." he said.
Some administration officials
have blamed the Soviets for the
worldwide proliferation of chem
ical weapons.
At the Geneva summit, the
Soviets refused to discuss the
"use" of chemical weapons but
agreed to work against Its pro
liferation.

Heart Patient Making Progress
MINNEAPOLIS lUI’ll — Marv Lund, first woman to
receive an artificial heart, has made dramatic progress
since her surgery Dec. 18, but doctors Friday said they
were puzzled bv the low level of clotting agent in her blood.
Lund. 40. was reported in critical but stable condition at
Abbott Northwestern Hospital, but doctors have upgraded
her survival chance to "better than 50-50."
She gradually came out of a light coma this week and
was startled to learn for the first time Thursday that she
had an artificial heart. A doctor said she opened her eyes
“ quickly and widely" at the news.
Doctors were puzzled why there has been a low number
of platelets in Lund's blood the past several days. Platelets
aid In clotting and physicians sav it could be critical If she
starts to bleed internally.

Aquino Platform Would A llo w
U.S. Military Bases To Remain
DAGUPAN. Philippines (i'PI) — Presidential candidate
Corazon Aquino told cheering supporters Friday she has
adopted a platform that would allow U.S. military bases to
stay In the Philippines under a treaty that runs until 1991.
The 23-point platlorm said Aquino, it elected in Feb. 7
elections over President Ferdinand Marcos, would respect a
treaty with Washington allowing the United Stales to use
the Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base until 1991.
it said however, she would not necessarily renew the
pact when it expires
"Since many events may occur between now and 1991.
we shall keep all our options open." the document said.
The stand echoes Aquino's statements on what she would
do when the pact expires, which have been vague.
Marcos. 68. has said lie favors allowing the bases to stay.
Marcos called the elections it] months ahead of schedule
amid U.S. criticism about his handling of a growing
communist insurgency that may threaten the American
bases.
Aquino attd her running mate. Salvador Laurel,
campaigned for the second day in towns and cities
regarded as Marcos strongholds in the northern Philip
pines.
Marcos, who has made only four trips outside Manila
since the campaign began, prepared to travel to three
provinces in the next four flays
Lebanese Peace Pact Delayed
B EIR UT. Lebanon (UPlj — President Am in Gemuycl
relumed Friday from Damascus and said he received
approval from Syria to delay implementing a peace accord
signed by Lebanon's three main rival militias until violence
subsides.
The fate of the agreement has been thrown into doubt by
fighting between Gemayel's forces and one of the three
militias, as well as by intense fighting in southern Lebanon
between militias that are not part of the pact.
Syria's agreement that implementation of the peace
accord be delayed until the violence in Lebanon subsides
followed Gemayel's meeting in Damascus with Syrian
President Hafez Assad, which centered on the need to
secure a Christian consensus to make the accord wotkablc.
Gemayel's assistance is vital to the success of the accord,
which calls for an end to a decade ol civil war. sets up a
new government, reduces the president's [lowers, and
makes provisions for an eventual end to the traditional
Christian political dominance.
"M y visit was very successful." Gcmayel said op his
return from Damascus Friday. "It will be necessary for us
to continue our talks with a view to reaching genuine [ware

Lawnmower Shop Gets P&Z Nod
By K arin Talley
HermM t u f f Writer
By allowing a lawnmower repair shop to
operate at 305 Palmetto Ave.. the Sanford
Planning and Zoning Commission has
assisted the progressive deterioration of an
area the city is trying to upgrade, according
to Palmetto Avenue resident Charles
Cameron.
At Th u rs d a y night's P&Z meeting.
Cameron termed the shop "nothing more
than a Junk yard" that would operate within
the city's proposed hiolotlu
"Is this kind of structure In keeping with
what the city wants for the area?" Cameron
asked the commission. "It seems to be* Just
the opposite of what should be located
there."
"I propose the board give consideration to
the historic district and the existing
eyesores In that area before voting."
Cameron said.
Commissioner Brent Carli cast the sole
vote in dissent of the shop. The com
mission's seven other members adopted its
site plan after ascertaining that Al Seymore,
owner of the proposed business, would
confine all work to the shop's Interior and
only operate It during the day.
According to Commission Chairman John
Morris, although Cameron "raised some
salient points." the lawn repair shop Is a
permitted use of that area's present zoning.
Morris said It would be "at least another six
months" before the parameters of the city's
historic district are established.
"Under that area's present zoning, the
■shop. " thc chalrman said.
The P&Z has also approved a rezonlng
that w ill enable Dorothy Meadors to
transform the stale's old auto Inspection
station at 401 E. 25th St. into a marine sales
and service center.
Mrs. Mcudors. who leases the property
from Seminole County, estimated the new
shop would open within the next two
months.
Another marine repair shop, this one
operating from behind a home at 2816
Sanford Ave.. will also open up this Hiring.
P&Z approval was granted by a 6-2 vote
after commissioners debated whether the
location could accommodate large boats and
trailers without negatively Impacting area
traffic.
Commissioners Card and Sheila Roberts
expressed their doubts by voting in opposi
tion to the proposal.
Approval was unanimous, however, for
the Polar Cup Corporation to operate a
permanent lemonade stand at 2521 French
- Ave. A company teprw emative told the P&z
the shop would open In April.
The State Farm Insurance Agency pres
ently located at the site will move Its offices
to 25th Street.
Another unanimous vote effectively shot
down a proposal to Increase the number of
units built at North Lake Village, located on
U.S. Highway 17-92. Just south of Lake
Mary Boulevard. A North Lake repre
sentative had asked P&Z approval for
construction of additional units In (he rear

Falwell Takes The Moral Majority
Beyond Social Causes: Gets Political
WASHINGTON (LTD - The
Rev. Jerry Falwell announced
Friday he is replacing his Moral
Majority with a new group that
wilt press for a broader con
servative agenda. Including
foreign and defense policy as
well as the usual social Issues.
The new "Liberty Federation"
will get S I2 million a year to
spend. Falwell said, up from the
Moral Majority's S7 million.
He also wants to run 2(X) new
conservative Christians for state
and local office this year and get
20 million religious right voters
out in the 1988 presidential
elections.
The group will launch its
program with a "national sum
mit" in Washington on Jan.
23-24 featuring Vice President
George Hush, who Falwell s u p
ports for president In 1988.
Falwell. who will be president
of both groups, said while the
Moral Majority has always been
as in terested in balanced
budgets and lighting commu
nism as abortion and [tomo
g rap hy. some believed the
group's name limited activities
to social issues.
"We will always be pro-family,
pro-life, pro-traditional values."
Falwell told a news conference.
"Hut it's time to broaden our.
h o riz o n s . We h a ve found
ourselves drawn into issues and
conflicts which were not antici
pated in 1979." when Moral
Majority was formed.
Falwell's announcement drew
prompt fire from one of his most
p e r s is t e n t c r i t i c s , J o h n
Buchanan, chairman of People
for the American Way.
"Now that he admits he is in
the political arena ... (Falwell)
should argue his positions on the
merits, not by declaring that
God and the Bible support Ills
v iews on every Issue from alxirlion to Zimbabwe." Buchanan
slid.
"He should stop pretending to
he the chairman of the Lord's
political action committee and
slop suggesting that to disagree
with Jerry Falwell is to side with
Satan against God."
The Moral Majority, which will
continue as a subsidiary of the
Liberty Federation, has been a
lightning rod for liberal critics
who condemn Falwell for wrap
ping the Bible in politics.
The religious right has become
a m a jo r p o litic a l force in
America In the last decade,
helping elect Jim m y Carter pres
ident in 1976 and then voting
heavily for President Reagan In
the last two elections. It has
raised millions of dollars to push
its social agenda through Con
gress. but has largely been
blocked by Supreme Court de
cisions in Tyin g to change policy
In such areas as busing, school
prayer and abortion.
The Liberty Foundation will
have an expanded lobbying arm
in Washington pushing such
issues as Reagan's "Star Wars"
defense system, strong support
of Israel, the fight against com
munism In Cuba and Central
America, and opposition to an
u n verified test ban treaty.
Fulwellsald.
He ulso said he Is not interest
ed in political office himself,
repeating that Bush is his can
didate for president in 1988.
Fellow evangelist Pat Robertson,
who Falwell expects to run for
the Republican nomination,
would "be an excellent presi
dent. but George Bush would be
better."
Falwell's "Old Time Gospel
Hour." the television program
that brings In mill tons of dollars
each year and helps finance his

Nation's Top Fishing Fleet In Trouble
NEW BEDFORD. Mass. |L'I'I| - Foreign
com petition, skyrocketing overhead,
dwindling catches and a major strike have
plunged one of the nation's most pmtitnhlr
fishing Heels into a fight for survival,
industry analysts said Friday.
The most pressing problem facing tin*
253-boat fleet is an 8-day-old fisherman's
walkout that has paralyzed New Bedford's
waterfront, robbing the city's economy of an
estimated SI million daily.
The strike was spawned by a dispute over
bow to divide the catch, which m 1984 was
worth S 107.7 million. Simply put. the boat
owners, citing hardship, are asking the men
who crew their vessels to settle lor a smaller
share of the profits.
But the economic struggle that lias pit
crews against boat owners has Its roots in a
variety of factors.
"These gentlemen are sitting in a game
where someone else controls all the cards,
and they’re lelt trying to make the best
hand possible." said James H Mathes.
executive director of tin- New Bedford Area
Chamber of Commerce.
Fishermen sav some ol the economic
hardships they now face stein Irom a 1984
World Court derision giving the Canadian
fleet exclusive rights to the northernmost
third of the Georges Bank — a footballshaped plateau northeast of Cape Coil
considered one of the world's most pro
ductive fishing grounds.
"Then the Canadian fishermen come
down here and sell their fish al belowmarket prices," said Mathes. "We're sure
they're being subsidized by their govern
ment."
Vaughn C, Anthony of the National
Marine Fisheries Service said a decline In
the number of fish located ofr the New
England roast has made matters worse.
"The big problem Utey’re having now Is
that the resources are down. They've been
overfished." Anthony said.
Boat owners In New England have seen
their net profits drop 50 percent since 1978.
be said, noting the total number of vessel
inps rose from roughly 35,000 to 50,000
during the same period.
In the Iasi four or five years, they’ve had
to work harder and harder for the same
catch "
Samuel A. Tucker, executive vlee presi
dent of the Mariner's Insurance Agency of
New Bedford — which handles 125 of the
fleet's boats — said many insurance compa
nies have pulled out of the fishing market.
For each $1 paid in premiums, the
Insurers are paying S I.50 In claims. Tucker
said.
"I think It 's safe to say there hasn't been a
profit made in Insuring fishing boats for the
last five years." Tucker said.
That has led to a 30 to 60 percent increase
in the boat owners' premiums, he said.
The tightening economic noose has forced
boat owners into asking their cretfs for
concessions, said David S. Barnet, attorney
for the Seafood Producer's Association of
New Bedford, which represents must of the
port's fleet.
"When times are good and everybody's
making u buck, there's no problem. When
times are bud. everybody hikes less." Barnet
said. "However, the fisherman as a wage
earner is. like the rest of us. met with a 4
percent Inflation rate. The boat owners have
met with outrageous inflation.”

Delta Crath Survivor Walks
Down Aisle O n Crutches
H O M ES TEA D (UPI) — Anita Garcia was on her way to
see her fiancee when Ihe Della Air Lines Jetliner she rode in
crashed at the Fort Worth-Dallas Airport, killing 137
people. Garcia was one of 28 who survived.
Saturday, after Mil operation* and-ft vemonths of painful'
therapy to correct injuries to her legs, head and nose, she
was on her way again to sec fiancee Steve Dewsnap. This
time, though, she was walking down her wedding aisle,
adorned in white lace, pearls, and leg braces.
"It's a nightmare, and it's been a long, hard haul." said
Mrs. Steve Dewsnap. "But. we're here today, so that's all
that counts."
Beneath her wrddlng gown. Anita Garcia wore special
leg braces which helped her inch her way down the aisle.
A priest spoke to this young couptc about love and
devotion, and their vows solemnized both their longtime
longing to be together, and Garcia's willingness to snap
back from a crippling accident.
Afterwards, she was swept her off her feet and carried
triumphantly down the aisle by her new husband, her
longtime sweetheart.
Garcia and Dewsnap had dated since high school and
had planned to be married Oct. 11. Garcia was flying to
meet Dewsnap. a second lieutenant stationed with the Air
Force in California, when the Delta jet crashed during a
thunderstorm.

Furman Moves To Washington
JA C K S O N V ILLE (UPI) — Controversial legal watchdog
Rosemary Furman, who defied a Florida Supreme Court
order to stop giving free legal advice, has sold her
Jacksonville office and moved to Washington. D.C.
Furman signed the final documents Thursday that
transferred ownership of the office where she operated her
Secretarial Services Inc. Furman then slipped out through
the back door of an attorney's office, avoiding a reporter
and photographer from the Florida Times-Unlon.
Furman's quiet departure was out of character for the
woman who usually was eager to be Interviewed, and
missed few opportunities to wage her vocal attack against
the legal profession.
In 1984. the Florida Supreme Court found her in
contempt for violating Its order to stop giving free legal
advice to her clients, who were mostly poor and illiterate.
She was sentenced to 120 days in Jail, with 90 days to be
suspended on the condition that she complete a two-year
probation without violating the court's injunction.
But alter a public outcry. Gov. Bob Graham and the
Cabinet commuted her remaining 30-dav Jail sentence.

The Right To Die
Society W ill Be H ard-Pressed Fo r A n sw e rs
By J sff Hsrdy
MIAMI (UPI) - Charles Griffith
-says he killed his comatosedaughter to end her suffering.
Roswell Gilbert says he had to
end his terminally 111wife's pain.
The law says both must spend at
least 25 years in Jail.
Juries In the Griffith $nd
Gilbert cases both asked that
they be allowed to submit a
response with their verdicts.
Both wanted sentences lighter
than the law allowed. Under
Florida law. people convicted of
Rrst-degrec murder must spend
at least 25 years In Jail.
"I thought It would come back
as manslaughter, but he said it
was going to be first-degree
murder." says Griffith's father.
Leroy. "Maybe in time, someone
will form a committee to de
termine the quality of life so no
one else will have to go through
this like we did."
P s y c h i a t r i s t s and
psychologists In the Griffith case
said — despite defense claims he
was insane — he knew exactly
what he was doing when he
stood by his 3-year-old‘s crib at
Miami Children’s Hospital in
June and shot her twice In the
heart.
But they all agreed Griffith is
not a threat to society, probably
would not kill anybody else and
would benefit more from outpa
tient psychological treament
than from Jail.
G ilb e rt's wife repeatedly
begged her husband to kill her
because she could no longer bear
the pain from Alzheimer's Dis
ease and the degenerative bone
malady, osteoporosis. Gilbert.
76. propped up Emily Gilbert,
his wife of 51 years, on their
couch March 3 and fired one
bullet Into the back of her head.
Her pulse indicated she was
not dead, so he fired another
ANALYSIS
•hot into the woman's head.
Both admitted they killed, but
the circumstances promulgated
a very sticky legal question.
Do they deserve a harsher
penalty than someone who
would be considered a "real”
criminal?
A person who served lime for
second-degree murder, got out
on parole and was convicted of
second-degree murder for killing
someone else while on probation
conceivably could be sentenced
to 17 to 22 years in Ja II.
Does premeditation — the
requirement for a first-degree
murder conviction — in these
cases make the crime any more
v io le n t th a n the d o u b le -
m u r d e r e r 's s e c o n d -d e g re e
homicides?
"I think there's a feeling that
you can put a Band-Aid on this
cancer by convicting people like
this, but that's certainly not the
answer." said Mark Krasnow.
Griffith's lawyer. "Juries must
find a simple way to solve a very
complex problem."
Should a dying person in pain
have the right to die? Legislation
is being drawn up specifically for
that purpose, said Derek Hum
phrey. executive director of the
Los Angeles-based Hemlock So
ciety.
He said there were 18 "mercy
killings" In the nation last year.
Griffith and Gilbert alone 're
ceived custodial sentences.
"Most states have more flexi
bility In homicide laws. They
recognize this crime is very
special." Humphrey said. "It is a
passionate crime and most
states have found ways to deal
with It more humanely."
H um phrey said both men
should have had their day In
court for killing their loved ones.
He said at least two alternatives
may help In the future.
One is to put more time and
effort into caring for the elderly
and the dying. The other is
legislation, which The Hemlock
Society plans to announce later
this month.
The bill, called the Humane
and Dignified Death Act. called
for doctor aid in dying. Hum
phrey said.
"If voluntary euthanasia were
available: a person In pain and
dying should be able In go to Ihe
doctor and get help to commit
suicide. If you will." he said.
“ It would have to be In the
final stages of a terminal Illness.
I'm not talking about people who
are Just sad. for instance."
Prosecutors say such u law
would only open the door to
more complicated legal Issues —
and more unnecessary killings.
They say Emily Gilbert. trtthough dying, was socially
active and had control of her life.
As for Joy Griffith, she was
comatose and in a vegetative
state, but she was so young
there was a chance the blonde,
blue-eyed toddler would recover,
prosecutors said.
Joy was a living human being
who was not being kept alive by
machines and her dud com
mitted a homicide, said AImLaeser. the government pro
secutor in the Grifftth case.
"Th e testimony did not show
that she was brain dead." he
said. "She was no more or less a
human being than someone who
was profoundly retarded."
Americans In Libya Defy Ban
TR IP O L I. Libya iUPI) Americans
working in Libya in defiance of a U.S.
government ban fear any U.S. or Israeli
retaliation for last week's terrorist attacks
on Rome and Vienna airports could en
danger their safely.
Libyan radio said statc-sancttoned an
ti-American demonstrations began in sever
al large Libyan cities Friday to protest U.S.
and ’sraeli accusations that Libya was
behind the Dec. 27 airport attacks that left
19 dead and more than 110 wounded.
Authorities investigating the attacks
believe they were staged by a breakaway
Palestine Liberation Organization faction led
by Sabrl al-Banna. better known by his code
name, Abu Nldal. Israel has vowed to
avenge attacks and. together with the
United States, has accused Libya of backing
Abu Nldal.
Protesters In several Libyan cities —
Including Sebha. Mlzantc and Zarma —
vowed to defend Libya if the United States
or Israel used military force to avenge the
airport attacks, the radio said.
The streets of Tripoli were quiet Friday.
and Libyan officials said they did not expect
protests to begin in the capital until today —
Ifat all.
In Washington, the Pentagon ordered Its
military might to within range of the North
African coast to be prepared if President
Reagan orders a retaliatory raid on Arab
terrorist camps In Libya, sources said.
The aircraft carrier USS Coral Sea left
Naples. Italy, on a course that will take it
past the Libyan coast and Navy planes with
sophisticated Jamming gear were shifted
from Washington state to u base In Sicily.

happen.
"W e talked about two things
at halftime," Lyman coach To m
Barnes ^ald. "Anticipation and
concentration. We were playing
well enough the first half, but
needed to add a little edge that
was missing. We moved the ball
a lot better the second half."
Lake Mary coach Bill Elssele
said his team turned In a valiant
effort but gave away a few goals
while not taking advantage of Its
offensive opportunities.
"Against Lyman, you have to
capitalize on every chance you
get." Elssele said. “ And you
can't give up the kind of dinky
goals that we did."

stage for what was an outstand

goal area and fired a shot on
which Lake Mary keeper Laura
Hellegaard made a diving save.
The ball rebounded to Boycscn
who had an open net. but Marjan
Stoncrock got back In time to
turn away Boycscn'a second
shot.
It took another four minutes
for Lyman to mount another
serious threat and. once again It
was Boycsen that made things

Greyhounds. Boycscn dribbled
down the left side and crossed
the ball to the middle where Kim
Mitchell got a foot on it and slid
It past Hellegaard for the game's
first goal.
Lyman had a couple chances
to add to the lead but Hellegaard
made excellent saves on both
tries. The first came on a vicious
shot by Shclta Mandy that was
headed Tor Hcllegaard's head.
But the senior keeper reached up
and tipped the ball over the
crossbar. Moments later, on a
throw-In by Mandy. Boycsen pul

Lyman wouldn't let up though

Herald Sports Editor
T im Haines, who learned a
month ago he would meet with
baseball commissioner Peter
Ueberroth concerning his past
Involvement with drugs, said he
doesn't expect a suspension
after they talk Thursday In New
York.
Ueberroth has said on several
occasions that drug abuse la the
biggest problem facing majorleague baseball and he plans to
take action against admitted
drug users who were shielded by
Immunity for testlylng In the
Curtis Strong drug trial last
summer.
Raines Is one of 24 players
Involved in the Curtis Strong
drug trial in Pittsburgh who has
been called to huddle with
Ueberroth. Ueberroth said he
will not make any decisions until
after he has meet with all 24
players.
Th e ex-Semlnole High star
underwent drug rehabilitation
for cocaine addiction In Orange
County. Cal. in 1982. Raines has
repeatedly maintained he has
not done any drugs since the
1982 season.
He reasons that his ability to
stay clean and his "upfront"
approach to his problem with
weigh strongly In his favor
during the meeting with Ueber
roth.
"I think I’ve set a good exam
ple since m y problem." Raines
said. " I don't egpect to be
suspended. I don't know about
the other players. It’s hard to say
what he (Ueberroth) will do with
them."
Raines did not testify In the
trial but did appear before the
grand Jury when the charges
were brought.
Strong, a former Philadelphia
Phillies caterer, was found guilty
of selling cocaine to players and
was sentenced to 12 years In Jail.
*'l didn't know Curtis Strange
and I didn’t hang around with
anybody who did." Raines said
last month. " I didn't go out to
nightclubs. What drug use 1 did
wasul parties."

NEW YORK (UPI) - The new year brings old
problems for the National Football League.
It matters not that It's 1986. In some comers
of the league, change moves at the pace of a
300-pound lineman.
Especially when change concerns the issue of
women In the locker room — a subject that has
been around for a decade and should have been
settled years ago.
!t seems odd to begin with that a crowded
steamy room reeking of liniment and sweatsoaked tape would be regarded by some as a
source of sexual tltlllallon.
But such notions die hard In the NFL. After
all. the thinking goes, this Is the locker room —
a sacred male preserve, a cross between the wild
frontier and an English men's club.
Consider the latest incident. The Washington
Redskins had Just beaten the Cincinnati Bengals
27-24 In a key game In mid-December. The
Bengals had blown a 24-7 lead. Their chance to
tie in the closing seconds was cut short with a
sack and missed field goal.
Cincinnati coach Sam Wyche Is discussing the
game with a group of reporters in an Interview
area at RFK Stadium. Other reporters bypass
the coach and head into the locker room.
Tw o In particular — Mary Cabot of the
Cleveland Plain Dealer and United Press In

Clark says Bengals tight end M.L. Harris
requested she not enter the room until the

but was "physically barred" from the room a
few minutes later.

Others said she had "no right" to be there.
"It was really humiliating." she says.
"If she had followed the guidelines and gone
over to listen to Sam and walked In with the rest
of the press there would have been nothing
about It." Bengals business manager Bill
Connelly says.
Clark contends she did listen to Wyche. But.
more Important, there la no league guideline
requiring a reporter to first speak with the
coach.
Connelly estimates the women were kept from
the players a few minutes longer than their male
colleagues. Clark says It was closer to 15
minutes and the locker room was "practically
empty" by the time she arrived.
"A ll reporters should be allowed In or all
reporters should be excluded so that it's fair for
all." Cabot says. "I'm angry that Cammy Clark

Joe Browne, the NFL's director of com

access to locker rooms. He adds the league's
lawyers are studying the Incident Involving
Clark.
Browne says "disciplinary action" was taken
against two unidentified clubs this season
concerning locker room policy. He admits there
Is "room for Improvement" but says the league
this season has received "very positive" results
in this regard.

Linebackers Hold Keys For Bears-Giants' Clash
CHICAGO (UPI1 - Two teams
that mirror each other — the
Chicago Bears und New York
Giants — line up Sunday with
nearly Identical key matchups.
The Bears, who used a bruis
ing defense, ground-oriented of
fense and mistake-free game
plan this season, are favored by
8 Vt points over the Giants, who
employed similar elements to get
to the NFC semifinals.
Linebackers on both teams
could provide the keys to the
amount of scoring. On the Bears'
side, middle linebacker Mike
Singletary, a two-time NFC de
fensive player of the year, will
lead the Chicago '46' defense
that will attempt tp penetrate the
Giants' offensive line to pressure
quarterback Phil Simms. Trying
to contain Singletary will be
guard Chris Godfrey.
"1 feel we're more confident,
more mature as a unit." Godfrey
says. "W e feel like we're for real.
Everybody's one season better
and one season smarter."
S in g le ta ry 's c o u n te rp a rt.
G ia n ts ' a ll-p r o lin e b a c k e r
Lawrence Taylor, will try to give
the Giants a similar rush to
pressure scra m b lin g
quarterback Jim McMahon.
Tryin g to contain the Taylorled Giants* rush will be ofTensIve
tackle Keith Vun Horne.
"They've got a great defense.
Just like ours, but we've been up
against our defense In practice
all year." Van Horne says.
N F C P la y o ffs
Playoff Preview on 2B
The Giants want to blitz, blitz
and blitz some more. They
recorded 68 sacks and were
second to Chicago in overall
defense.
The defenses should be keying
on two of the NFL's premier
backs, Walter Payton of the*
Bears and Joe Morris of the
Giants.
Payton Is a bruising runner
who. once he breaks the of
fensive line, has excellent open
field speed despite being In his
11th N FL season. Morris, a
compact runner, also has great
speed in the open field.
"Our Job Is to contain him and
not let him break for the big
gains." Singletary says. "If we
do that and force them to throw
more, they will be playing the
kind of game we’d like to see
them play."
The back with the biggest day
could very well be the back on
the winning team.
The matchup that could be the
most pivotal In a close game Is
the one between the kickers. The
Bears offer rookie Kevin Butler,
who missed on only seven
field-goal attempts In 38 at
tempts this year and has not
missed an extra point.
Butler will be up against Eric
Schubert, who had an off-day in
the Giants' -17-3 win over the
defending Super Bowl champion
San Francisco 49ers last week in
the wild card game.
Schubert still had good num
bers In the regular season, con
verting 10-of-13 field goals. But
he missed twice within the
29-yard line and will not have
had the benefit of prior experi
ence In the s w ir lin g , u n
predictable winds at Soldier
Field off Lake Michigan^
"We're confident that Kevin
may give us an edge when It all
comes down to It." said Bears
coach Mike Ditka.

Bears. Giants Face
C H IC A G O (UP!) The Chicago
Bearn and New York Giants, teams
which have emerged into champion
ship caliber after long years of
slumber, face each other Sunday in the
200th playoff game in the 65-year
history of the National Football
League.
The record book shows they are the
Ideal teams to celebrate such an
anniversary.
The first two playoff games the NFL
ever held — In 1933 and 1934 — were
between the Giants and the Bears.
Their last post-season meeting came in
1963 with the NELtHlr.nn-thc-llne,---------Over the next 20 years the Bears
made only two playoff appearances
and the Giants had none, but now they
will confront each other once more
with the winner moving to within a
step of the Super Bowl — a game
neither has ever reached.
“Th is brings back memories of the
days when the Giants were as good as
anybody in football and the Bears were
good, too.” said Chicago coach Mike
Ditka.
Chicago won its first 12 games of the
season, lost o n ly once, reaped
enormous national publicity from the
play of a part-time running back and
has become the clear favorite to win
the Super Bowl.
New York made It Into the playoffs
as a wild card team with 10 victories
and then played its best game of the
season in disposing of the defending
S uper Bowl champion San FruncukHT
49ers last Sunday.
All of that has led to speculation that
the two best teams in pro football will
be meeting at Soldier Field Sunday.
Chicago is a 9-point favorite.
Kickoff for the divisional playoff
game Is set for 11:30 a.m. C ST.
N F C P la y o ff Sunday: 92:90 p.m. Wi Fx-e
Forecasts called for decent feather
w ith the gam etim e temperature
expected to be above freezing.
A win by Chicago would Ifive the
Bears hosting the NFC tltlt game
against either the Los Angeles lams or
Dallas Cowboys. A New Yc k win
would send the Giants to the w finer of
the Rams-Cowboys encounter.
The B e a r s - r . la n t s game wii -b rin g together two of the most f tyslcal
teams in the NFL. And the Glar s tried
to enhance their half of that rep itatlon
following their 17-3 win ovir San
Francisco.
" I hope the Bears aren’t disap
pointed they won’t get to pi: y San
Francisco." said New York lint lacker

Like the Bears. New York does not

IN BRIEF
Akers Shakes Up Texas Staff,
Hires Painter To Help Offense
A USTIN . Texas |UPI| — Dwain Painter, who helped
fashion explosive olfcnscs at UCLA. Brigham Young and
Georgia Tech, has been hired to direct the offense at Texas

helping establish high-scoring offenses at UCLA and
Brigham Young before becoming an assistant at Georgia
Tech in 1982. Painter also was head coach at Northern
Arizona lor three seasons.
There was speculation In recent weeks that Akers' Job
might be in Jeopardy, but the chairman of the university
committee responsible for hiring ami llrlng coaches said
Akers’ chances of returning next season are "very good."
"I think he’s done very well." said Tom Morgan of the U T
Men's Athletics Council. "Th e trouble is there’s been a lot
of talk, but we haven't discussed it internally. I'd say they
(chances of returning) are very good."
Earlier In the day Akers said he would not renew the
contracts of offensive coordinator Ron Toman, running
bucks coach Ronnie Thompson, tight ends coach Ralph
Harris and assistant linebackers couch Scott Conley.

Rick's Cut* Llttla Quiz
For Botwoon Quarters
Every once In a whiie you get something In the
mall which is worthwhile. T received an inter
esting missive the other day.
Nothing earth-shaking, now, but Just the same
It's a cute little game which might give you
something to do between the quarters this
weekend.
The following is a football quiz mailed in by
reader Gary "Merk" Metzen of Mendota. 111.
"M erk" modestly gives credit to Rick Beatty as Its
originator. Rick Just completed the fifth grade at
Frtzol's Daycare School.
Rick supplies you with a few words which
define or relate to the nickname of a professional
football team. There are 27 definitions and by
process of elimination you must figure out the
28th team.
Some of the definitions are easy: King of
Beasts? Some are not some easy: A rm y Insect?
Don't let me catch you checking the standings
either. For that reason alone, you won't find a
rundown of the teams in thisi paper. The answers
will appear In Monday's SCOREBOARD.
Now remember don't look at a list of the teams.
If you do. you're sentenced to seven weeks of
Australian Rules Football lowlights. If you do
complete this list conrectly, though, you win a full
scholarship to Frizol’s Daycare Center. Then, you
can team to make up your own lists.
Here's the list:

of mistakes Saturday. Bernle Kosar does that
frequently In the pros. — Miami by 21 at
halftime and finally 35.
Saturday: Dallas at Los Angeles Rams — This
game shouldn't even be played. Neither of these
teams can beat Chicago or the New York Giants
anyway. Dieter Brock has yet to shake the
Canadian Football League from his system and
Eric Dickerson only runs at the end of the month.
Dallas has a moody running back of Us own in
Tony Dorsetl. He's the guy who changed the
pronunciation of his name (Dor-SIT to Dor-SET)
when he left Pitt. Too bad he didn't forge a
diploma while he was at It. — Dallas by 3 in
overtime.
Sunday: New York Giants at Chicago. My boss
wants the Giants to win. That's a good enough
reason for the Bears to maul them. Everybody
knows Phil Simms is suspect. He just needs
Soldier Field and the growling Monsters of the
Midway to prove it. Besides, the Bears have an
added incentive — win one for Bill Veeck. He used
to drink beer at football games, too. — Chicago
by 17 with a shutout.
Sunday: New England at Los Angeles Raiders
Everybod) laughed when I picked the Patriots
over the Jets. Wait a minute. You didn't laugh
because I kept that pick secret. I didn't want you
to laugh. Anyway, the Pats won and they'll win
again this week. How would you like the gamble
the future on Marc Wilson. Worse news for the
Raiders was that Jim Plunkett's able to play
again. — New England by 12 with four field

Checking Account Deregulation

Until now. customers had to
maintain at least $1000 in a
Super-NOW Account to earn
more htan 5Vi percent Interest .
Floating rate money market ac
counts also required a minimum
opening balance of $1,000. NOW
Accounts, although free of a
required minimum balance, paid
only 5 H percent Interest.

phase of deregulation, many
bankers feel rales will not take

Monthly Financial Maintenance
Can Save You Money Thru Year
Are you planning your finan
cial future? Would you like to
turn over a new financial leaf for
1986’’ Do you feel as though you
squander ed muc h of y o ur
money on unimportant items in
1985?
To manage your money wisely
in 1986. organize your financial
life with a monthly program.
According to the Florida Institute of CPAs, by performing
some financial maintenance
each month, you'll gain better
control over your money. Here
are some ideas to help you in
1986 Ja n u a ry. The sooner you
make a contribution to a 1986
IRA. the more tax-free earnings
you' l l accumul ate. If selfemployed. open a Keogh. An IRA
or Keogh will lower your current
tax liability and build a retire
ment n'-st egg if you have not
already contributed to a 1985
IRA. you ha1,e until April 15 to
do so The deadline for Keogh
was Der ember 31. 1985 There
are no extensions to these
deadlines April 15 is also the
deadline for a 1985 income tax
return. The sooner you file, the
quicker you'll get back a refund
if any is due
Reminder: Investing in a 1986
tax shelter should be considered
now to ensure getting the safest
and fullest tax benefits
Fe b ru a ry. Draw up a budget.
Figure out your fixed expenses
for each month of the year.
Include rent or mortgage pay
ments. utilities and any other
expense which you do not con
trol Then calculate the monthly
sum of all expenses over which
you have some control: transpor
tation. taxes, medical care, en
tertainment, clothing. Insurance
and food. Then, add up your
Income from wages and In
vestments for each month of the
year. Subtract the difference to
determine your "discretionary"
income — If any. Set aside a
reasonable cash fund each week
for out of pocket expenses. Set
aside a portion for savings or
investments. M arch. Plan to
reduce taxes this year. Estimate
your 1986 taxable Income. Make
sure you're not having too much
w ithheld from your weekly
paycheck. If in need of shelter
front taxes, review investments
now. Check your capital gains
position. Consider establishing a
trust or making a gift to shift
Income to a lower-bracket family
member.
A p ril. Deal with debt. If you
are in debt because of credit
cards, consider consolidating
credit card loans. Credit card
debts frequently carry annual
interest rates that are higher
than other loan rates. By taking
a personal loan to pay back
credit card companies, you can
rut the Interest dollars you pay
back. Where possible, use a
savings account as collateral for
a personal loan.
Reminder: You must file your
1985 tax return by April 15 or
apply for an extension, but you
have only until the 15th to
establish a 1985 IRA.
May. Tune up your savings. If
you are maintaining a savings
account, be sure to leave no
more than a three-to-six-month
"emergency fund" in ordinary
savings or money market ac
counts. Put any extra cushion in
other instruments that yield
more than money market ac
counts. Begin to survey the
investment arena for a stock,
bond, mutual fund or other
investments that will suit your
ability to take risk.
Jane. Manage risks. Review
insurance policies. If you were to
become disabled or suddenly
die. what cushion has been
provided for your family? Find
out how long you must be
unable to work before a disabili
ty policy will begin paying you.
Many policies do not pay
benefits until you are disabled

needed. Figure out the savings
vou need to set aside in order to
retire at age 55, People In their
50s m ay want to begin looking
for ways to raise equity. You
may want to sell a home after
your children are grown and no
longer live there. As retirement
nears, it's wise to coordinate
insurance, estate, investment
and tax planning to match
requirement goals.
Septem ber. Figure out your
net worth. Add up your assets —
y o u r house, car. personal
possessions, current Investment
values, cash surrender value of
life insurance and your savings.
Then total your liabilities —
mortgage debt and other out
standing personal debts. Finally,
subtract liabilities from assets to
find your net worth. Annually
examining your net worth will
make you aware of major trends
in your financial well being. It
will also be helpful if you need to
apply for a personal loan.
October. Determine how your
estate will be divided in the
event of your death. If your
taxable estate is greater than
S500.000 and you die In 1986.
the excess will be taxed at
progressive rates of 37 to 55
percent. An estate passes to a
spouse tax-free, however, no
matter how large It is If you do
not have a will, you may want to
consult an attorney to draw up
one. Existing wills should be
updated.

Chairman Sara Jacobson.
"In the past." she Mild, "the
city has shown a definite lack of
maintenance In Its grcenbelt
areas and we've attributed this
to a lack of expertise and
manpower in the parks de

Supplementing the depart

change from an otherwise un

groomed lady." Ms. Jacobson
said.

Just as comprehensive Is the
SIB's overall master plan, which,
according to Ms. Jacobson, has
received "tremendous" support
from the city's commissioners
and Its manager. Frank Faison.
The SIB was formed, she said.
" because of the city's lack of
maintenance and our prior city
commissions' lack of sensitivity
to the problem."
Now. with administrative and
community support, many of

Also, as the result of the SIB.
Sanford now has a historic
district board whose charter
calls for unification and pre
servation of buildings in the
city's downtown and surround

"Sanford’s charm and distinc

" A n d by ac ce n t in g this

we can compete with the new

According to Ms. Jacobson,
underscoring the SIB effort is a
desire "to return the city to
where It was 20 years ago.
Rather than urbanize, we want
to attract new residents to San
ford by creating a clean, rural
atmosphere."
She said the SIB "remains,
ever cognizant that Sanford will
continue to grow, but we want It
handled the right way. With
H«velopment comes positive and
negative Impacts. We must
make the efforts now to attract
the positive aspects or else we'll
end up inheriting the negative
side."
She also said continued sup
p o rt from local residents,
merchants and Industries will
achieve this for Sanford. "We
can't do It alone and thus far we
haven't had to. This kind of
support has got to continue if
we’re going to successfully at
tract the beneficial aspects of
development. At the same lime,
though, we have to revitalize
what Is already here."

"Lots of people overlook the
personal care regimen when
they start a fitness plan, and
then get discouraged because
they end up spending a lot of

T o a great degree, what is
happening mirrors Hit* best rela
tionship between words and
music In a Broadway show.
Winemakers have traditionally
had a tendency to view chefs as
their Intellectual Inferiors, mere
laborers who could never un
derstand the chemical complex
ity that made their drink so
memorable. And chefs looked on
winemakers as fresh-air versions
of bookworms, who couldn't put
on a dinner for 100 if iheir lives
depended on it.
It was a classic case of short
sightednesson both parts.
Not surprisingly, the push
toward change came from the
New World not the old — and it
came at a time of quiet revolu
tions within the consumption
and production of wine.
In general. Americans are
drinking less at the dinner table,
a function of stiffening drunken
driving laws and some legitimate

NEW YORK (UPI) - Ameri

drinkers and diners arc at last
giving credence to a notion they
entertained at some level all
along — personal taste is really
what counts.
At the production and market
ing level, winemakers are chang
ing the way they make their
beverage to better accompany
lighter cuisine. And chefs arc
creating menus with a serious
eye toward the liquids that will
wash them down.
"It’s a natural evolution. Just
as the American menu Is a
natural evolution." said David
Poliak Jr., who put together a
group of investors In 1980 to

Valley.
"Americans for so long have

tional hard liquor.
This switch, along with a
dramatic rethinking of French
cuisine produced by the nouvclle
movement and a fresh emphasis
on native American food, has
created quite an atmosphere In
which to be a winemaker.
"Since I came to America In
1961, lots of t hi ngs have
changed." said Robert Stem

In a sense. Chateau Bouchalne
and Stemmier are both working
toward the same goal. They
attack the traditional notion that

bulk but lack the quality of

Germany.
They are fighting this battle by
limiting their production (the
phrase "boutique winery" has
been coined), keeping quality
and price as high as need be to
support such operations.
Both take from the European
tradition the stubborness re

Pins, O ther Je w e lry Set O ff Hats
By Florence De Bentle
During the early years of this
century, hatpins were an Im
portant accessory. Skewered
through the hair, they anchored
the big, decorative hats worn by
women before World W ar I.
Naturally, they were elaborately
Jeweled.
Now the hatpin is bark, but
It's pinned to the hat. In the
current trend to lavish Jewelry
for the "raj," the "Amadeus"
and other dreaeed-up looks, lav
ish accessories have gone even
to the head. A hat is scarcely a
hat unless It has some kind of
Jewelry accent.
Simplest versions arc the casual berets wi th goldembroidered crests sewn on by
the hat designers. For spring,
the background color is often red
or black. Plain berets, a popular
head-style for spring, can carry
any gold pin you like.
The sophisticated Jeweled hat
was launched by Donna Karan
in her first Independent collect
tion for fall. The collection she
worked with came almost en
tirely in black and she used
black hats, in exaggerated bcrei
shapes set on deep forehead
bands. Made by Maevc Carr,
they were accented with a
side-perched geometric pin.

not quite enough for slam.)
Instead, he cue-bid three spades

There wasn't much play for

Involved is a type of double
finesse In spades. Declarer can
play West for the K-Q. the K-IO
or the Q-10. Since two chances
are better than one. the normal
play is to lead to dummy and pul
in the nine. If that forces an
honor, declarer can then hope
that the remaining honor is with
West. And that's the way tt was.
but that ts not the end of the
story.
When South first played a
spade. West, who had read some
bridge books, put up his queen.
Now what? I'll leave it to you
readers to decide whether de
clarer made his slam. Just
remember that sometimes second hand hi gh can put a
monkey wrench Into declarer's
machinery. If declarer now de
cides that West has both the
king and the queen of spades, he
will lose two spade tricks and the
slam contract.

Congress has passed another farm
bill. While It Is unclear at this writing
whether President Reagan will sign It.
agricultural leaders are already out
telling farmers how to operate under
the new regime.
I had a chance to sit In on one town
meeting at which Fred Fuddle, a
low-ranking official at the Department
of Agriculture, was lecturing a group of
Wyoming wheal farmers.
"Well boys." Mr. Fuddle began. "It's
a real pleasure for me to be here with
you. As you know, there’s one basic
thing our government counts on vou to
do."
"To grow food?" one young farmer
asked.
" G o o d grief n o ! " Mr. F ud dl e
exclaimed. "Your government wants
you to not grow food. That's been our
goal, that Is our goal, and that will be
our goal under this new farm bill. If
there's anything your Congress agrees
on. It's that you boys shouldn't be
growing so much food."
"What do you want us to do. open a
bowling alley or something?" another
young farmer asked.
"Heavens no," Mr. Fuddle replied.
"Your government is committed to
keeping you on the farm. The family
farm is the backbone of this great
country of ours. We Just don’t want you
growing food on your farms, that's all."
"Well young man. Just how do you
bureaucrats figure to get us to stop
producing food?" The question came
from a wizened old farmer in the back
of the room.
"Same way as always. We're going to
be offering you a higher price — a
pricey way above what you'd get in the
market.”
"U h. excuse me. str." It was the first
young farmer. "How is giving us a
higher price going to get us to stop
growing food? I thought giving us a
Higher price would make us want to
produce even more."
"Where’ve you been the last few
ya— . young man? School or something? O f course offering you a higher
price will make you want to grow more.
Encouraging you boys to produce more
food la at the heart of U.S. agriculture
policy."
"But how can getting us to stop
growing so much food and encouraging
ua to grow more food both be at the
heart of our country's policy? the
second young man asked. Mr. Fuddle
was beginning to look annoyed.
"Look," he snapped, "you know
what 20-10 is. don't you?"
"Some sort of new fertilizer ratine?"
Mr. Fuddle rolled his eyes toward the
heavens.
"2 0 -1 0 Is the link between our
policies of getting you to grow less and
getting you to grow more." he sighed
wearily. "In order to qualify for the
high prices that get you to grow more,
you've got to plant 20 percent less
wheat.
" T h a n If you plant another 10
percent less wheat on top of that, we'll
not only guarantee you a high price for
what you do plant, but we'll buy the
wheat you didn’t grow on the 10
percent extra you didn't plant."
"But wait a minute." the first young
farmer objected. "I .thought you wanted
to encourage our exports."
" O f course wc do," Mr. Fuddle
replied. "Encouraging exports is one of
the cornerstones of your government's
farm policy. We're counting on you
boys to help us erase that little old
trade deficit of ours."
"But If you're making us cut back
our output and raise our prices. Isn't
that going to continue to cut us out of
by the end of the year will
be on a low note.”
After analyzing T e d ’s
appetite. Frymlre’s 1986
forecast was for Inflation to
be 6 percent, an up-anddown stock market, a
budget-balancing tax in
crease, low er gasoline
prices and an unemploy
ment rate of 9 percent.
Frymire computed the
Jobless rale by putting 10
grains of corn in front of
Ted. who ale all bu; one.
Ted chose the single
grain of corn In front of a
lax hike sign and Ignored
the "no lax hike" grain.
"He never did go near
the grain at the 'no' sign.”
Frymire said.

Shouted Candor

During ;i recent writer's conference in
Moscow. Soviet poet Yevgeny Ycvtushncko
delivered a stirring speech calling for candor

subjects rarely discussed publicy in the

HELEN THOM AS
Cabinet Reshuffling To Continue In 1986
W ASHINGTON (UP1) A year ago last
January. President Reagan passed the word that
he did not want to "break up a winning team."
Well, no sooner were the words spoken than
the Cabinet reshuffle and the exodus of some
members began.
All of Reagan's top White House aides, who
made up the troika In his first term, flew the
coop or took Cabinet posts. Other aides went
Into lucrative public relations work such as
deputy chief of staff Michael Deaver.
Counselor Edwin Mecse became attorney
general and chief of staff James Baker became
Treasury secretary.
The Cabinet took on a new look last year, and
more changes are expected this year.
Some White House reporters are betting that
Donald Regan, the former Treasury secretary,
who swapped Jobs with Baker, may be on his
way out.
There is a strong Reagan conservative con
stituency that wants Secretary of State George
Shultz out of the Cabinet.
Shultz has adopted a devil-may-care attitude
because he knows he has an academic chair
waiting for him at Stanford University.
Housing Secretary Samuel Ptcrcc Is expected
to wend his way out of the Cabinet, perhaps this
year.
Cabinet officials who left In 1985 were
Education Secretary Terence Bell; Labor
Secratary Raymond Donovan and Health and
Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler
who has been named ambassador to Ireland.
There also was the departure of budget director
David Stockman who has been replaced by
James Miller.
National security affairs adviser Robert
McFarlane also threw In the towel and was
replaced by Adm. John Poindexter.
The president is not a man who wants to hold
on to advisers once they have made up their
minds to leave. He has said repeatedly he does
not expect his appointees to stay with him the
full eight years and appreciates the time they
decide to spend tn government.
With the shakeup. the powerhouse’ In the
White House is Regan, who lets the others know
In no uncertain terms who Is boss.
Regan brought In his own staff from the
Treasury Department, and they have taken over
the West Wing.
_____
Secretary of State George ShulU has two big
name supporters In his stand against taking lie
detector tests, and both are from the con
servative camp — former U.N. Am bassador
Jcane Kirkpatrick and McCarthy-era lawyer Roy
Cohn.
. . .
Both focused on the unreliability of He
detectors.
Shultz displayed some courage In defying the
presidential order and threatening to resign tf he
was required to take It.
Some State Department officials applauded
him for winning the day but some felt that he
should have made the same declaration of
integrity for all the State Department employees
who will be subjected to the polygraph.

W A S H I N G T O N (NEA) For
many years, most breadwinners
were male, and the Social Security
system was based on that fact.
Although this is no longer true.
Social Security still reflects this
view — and. as a result, the system

especially those in two-income fami
lies.
It's widely agreed that these
distinctions should end. yet the cost
of ending gender discrimination is
so astronom ical that it might
threaten Social Security's solvency.
Social Security penalizes women
in a number of ways. For example,
most elderly women, particularly
widows, get lower benefits than do
men or couples.
Divorced spouses also face pro
blems. Form erly, they received
nothing. Now a spouse who is
divorced after 10 years of marriage
can draw a 50 percent benefit, but
in 1981-82. that was only $238 a
month for those who were newly
retired. Many say that this is unfair
and that the divorced spouse should
receive a higher share of benefits.
However, the major problem oc
curs when both spouses have
worked and the wife has built up a
significant amount of Social Securi
ty credit on her own.
On retirement, many women find
that they can get no more from
Social Security in their own right
than they're entitled to as spouses
— even though they've made their
own large contributions. At 65 or

The process of eliminating this
difference Is called earnings shar

Lust year. Congress asked the
Social Security Administration to
devise some alternative earnlngssltarlng plans and determine what
such ti plan would cost. The SSA
said that such a plan could be
devised — tint il had a small
dr awbac k: If It ensured that
earnings credits were divided evenly
between husbands and wives and
that there were no losers — that, for
the next 75 years, everyone re
ceived at least as much in benefits
as tie nr she would under current
law — it would cost an additional
$16 billion per year in 1984 dollars.
" T h e philosophy behind the
earnings-sharing idea is based on
the community- property princi
ple." said the SSA report. "Th e
basic Idea is that marriage is an
equal economic partnership and
that assets accumulated during
marriage — including Social Securi
ty earnings credits — should be
divided equally between s j m h i s c s .
regardless of how they choose to
allocate homemaklng and breadwinning responsibilities."
Under some of the other plans
presented, some people would have
gotten less than they’d get under
the current system. One plan was
designed to equalize benefits for
one- and two-earner couples with
the same earnings: it would provide
higher benefits for 37 percent of
elderly couples by 2030. and lower
benefits for 44 percent.

Lately, more young white cons are
being sent to prison than ever before,
and they're thrown In with blacks. If 90
white cons are dumped In a labor camp
with 500 blacks, it's not integration —
It's Inhumane. Mixing the races must
be done with extreme concern and
care. It cannot be viewed as a cultural
exchange expedition or as a form of
punishment. This Is not Podunk High
and these are not kids. If the numbers
don't Jive. It work't work.
Another important consideration
should be educational levels. Putting
50 fourth grade level convicts in with
400 ninth graders is dangerous. If
Integration Is to be successful, officers
must look at every criteria, not Just
size, toughness and orneriness of the
inmates.
By Albert "R ace” S t a p le
As a product of 17 years at a prison
work farm In Texas, and now being on
the other side as a corrections official.
I've seen both sides of the problems
surrounding our prisons today. As a
result. I'm often asked to comment on
ihe system, and give my thoughts on
how to Improve It. While 1 do not
profess to be un expert In the field of
[Mmology. I do have opinions.
Society needs to redefine the purpose
of incarceration — arc we sending
people to prison to be kept, to be
punished, or to a prison program
designed lu help convicts become
better citizens?
If the latter Is the case, we arc falling
badly. Usually, prisons make good
prisoners, not good citizens. Basically,
prisoners learn for the sake of survival
how to "do time." They learn the ropes,
they know what It takes to be a "good
convict." As a result, prisons across the
country arc bursting at the seams,
mostly with recidivists. Many people
say. "Well, If prison Is so tough, why do
we have so many convicts going
back?" There's no readjustment pro
cess for prison re-entry. Inadequately
prepared to function in the free world,
the fear of going back to prison where a
con knows he can "make It” is greatly
diminished.
It also Is not hard to get back In.
Courts and juries are sending convicts
back faster than the parole board can
release them. If the courts keep sending
them, the prisons have to keep taking
them and returning them worse than
before. Thus, the prison's doors con
tinue to revolve.
However, there are those who should
remain In prison forever. Because of the
nature of their crimes, they've forfeited
their rights to live In a free society. The
courts can stipulate this, and jurists
can request It. These kinds of criminals
should be the majority of those In
The Rave sad Have-Net System:
confinement.
1 believe It's lime to shift the
emphasis from "what we gonna do to
you" to "what we gonna do to help
you."
W ork should be required of all
physically and mentally able Individu
als. However, It should be structured to
be both beneficial to the prisoner as
well as to the system, which benefits
from the fruit of the con's labor. Work
should be presented as healthy, helpful
and necessary — not as the most severe
farm of punishment.
Here are some other suggestions:
Overcrowding: Experts in sociology
have studied the effects of overcrowd
ing for years. Depression, anger, violent
behavior and aggression are common
reactions when there Is hardly room to
breathe. When people are crowded In
elbow to elbow, even the most "civi
lized" will scratch, rlaw and fight for
every available Inch of space. Fighting
among prisoners could be greatly
reduced If there weren't so many of
them face-to-face and back lo back.
Classification: Every criteria needs
to be examined when deciding where to
The have and have-not system has
far-reaching, devastating effects that
have plagued prisons for years. It
perpetuates more violence, and more
homosexual activity than all the other
deficiencies combined.
Many convicts and their families are
Indigent. Once Incarcerated, the major
ity of cons are forgotten by their
families and spend years without a visit
or a letter from home. Most only brush
their teeth when they can bum a
"squeezin'' of toothpaste to put on their
linger which they use as a toothbrush.
It's not difficult to start feeling that
nobody gives a damn and begin to
behave accordingly. Who rebels? The
underprivileged.
The prison system must take away
the bartering capabilities of convicts.
The prison-operated commissaries sell
merchandise to all Inmates for about
the same price as In the free world.
While the profits go back Into the
system, the merchandise sold to the
cons Is used to gam ble and Is
exchanged for weapons and sexual
favors. If the have-nots can't beg the
basics, they'll steal them or do "special
favors" lo get them. Don't even think
about what an entire carton of
"squares" (cigarettes) or a pint of lee
cream doth wrought.
It takes guts not to beg or be
somebody's patsy to obtain some of the
prison luxuries. It's tough to watch
other cons smoke cigarettes or .eat
ice-cream purchased from the com
missary without feeling envious or
angry. It’s easy to succumb to want,
especially if you don't have the basics.
The "haves" know this as well as
anybody. Th e "have-nots" without a
t o o t h b r u s h , toothpaste, razor,
razorblades. writing tablet or a stamp
become the prey and subjects of the
"haves." In prison, everything has a
price. If prisons would provide the
necessities to all. It would greatly
impact on violence, homosexuality and
greed. Take away some of the Ine
quities and balance the system.
After all. It doesn’t have to be
luxurious to be humane. The little old
school I went to as a kid certainly had
no luxuries — no toilets, hand-me-down
books from the white schools, the
whole bit. But I can still say my
multiplication tables with both eyes
closed.
O m v 4 Training: If progress is
expected, it must begin with the key
man. the "line boss" or supervisor.
Much like a first-grade teacher, he can
lay the positive ground work and
should be recognized for it. When he Is
trained, teach him how to help also.
Policemen cany guns and are trained
how to make arrests, etc. But they're
also trained in ethnic relations, social
interaction, self-control and courtesy.
Should training be any different for
prison personnel? Ater all. they work
with the same clientele.
We need less T V . more study time,
more time to teach and to learn. If
prisons hope to instill self-betterment
and teach how to get ahead in life, then
extra effort and sacrifice must also be
stressed. The system must control the
environment and make It conducive to
self-betterment. If not. then we d better
close up shop. If there is one speck of
human dignity left, it must be left
Intact. Otherwise, what's left to build
on?
As Goethe wrote. "When we treat a
man as he Is, we make him worse than
he is. If we treat him as if he is already
what he potentially could be. we make
him what he should be.”

Sloppy Publisher To Blame For Books
Mistakes, But Novel Not Ruined By Them
Thank you for the review pertaining

Please allow me to comment on
your observations.
First, let me agree with you 100
percent on the substandard quality of
the editing and spelling throughout
the hook. In general, the carelessness
and sloppiness of the publisher,
compounded my mistakes, rather
than correcting them. At times, com
plete sentences and paragraphs were
omitted. One time. In fact, they
deleted two complete pages. I raised
enough h.... they reinserted these
pages, but It was a frustrating experi
ence!
Meantime, my father passed away

project. An agreement that stipulated
IK) working days, was then stretched
to over 300 days. The cover photo of
the Federal charge and the Inside
photo of a Confederate battle line,
were reversed. These pictures were
taken at one of the Olustce reen
actments. The search for reputable
and competent publishers goes on.
My great-great, grandfather was a
member of Garibaldi's Red Shirt
soldiers. Lincoln did not offer the
Commander and Chief position to
Garibaldi, and I did not say this. I did
say. through Sam Garnett's opinions,
thitt the Job of Command of the
Federal Armies was offered. At that
time. 1863-64. this was the rumor
that was circulated and printed In
l>oth Federal and Southern papers.
The fact that Garibaldi was offered
only a Brigadier. $100,000 In cash,
plus $25,000 per year, was not
revealed for some time. Maybe 1
should have Insisted on footnotes, but
all of these were somehow not printed.
I'm sorry you got the Impression
that Mellonvlllc was near Lake
Harney. I mentioned that Fort Reed
was a mile from Fort Mellon, and Dr.
Algernon Speer's orange grove, also
mentioned. Is certainly nowhere near
Lake Hurncy. I used my 1860 Florida
map. printed by Julius Blen ft Co..
N.Y. for references throughout the
book.
You mentioned that there was no
explanation as to why Sam Garnett
freed his slaves. This was obvious
through the actions of Garnett, his
closeness to his 'people.' and the
assurance that they would not m n
away and leave him with no workers.
He also thought ahead when he
accumulated tools, naval stores, and
hard currency. The freeing and hiring
of slaves was a common action by
some slave owners at this time.
Lincoln had announced the Em an
cipation Proclamation after the battle
of Antletam. This battle was the
closest thing to a victory the North
had yet achieved. The document was
only aimed at the seceded slaveowning slates, other states were
exempt. Even General Lee had volun
tarily freed his slaves. Your article
comments that I had the British Prime
Minister's name wrong. The fact that
Carlton Press omitted the 's' It. his
name, should not have misled you.
You criticized that "women In the
novel exist to be rescued, of course.
They have no thoughts about the war
or their lives or anything else." I'm
afraid you may have read certain
passages too quickly. Ernestine. Flora,
Cora, and Lydia, certainly were opi

not think In 20th century terms.

Whot Medicare
Doesn't Cover
Do you recall my warnings that
Medicare doesn't cover long-term
nursing-home costs?
A reader who discovered that the
hard way wrote me about her situation.
Her husband had a series of strokes
10 years ago. and she eventually had to
place him In a nursing home.
"Between Medicare and m y Insur
ance at my place of employment." she
wrote. "It covered expenses for 90
days. From that time on. I have been on
m y own.
"M y husband has a fairly good
pension. For some time, his pension
plus Social Security paid for his
expenses. Nursing-home costs have
risen faster than his income: therefore.
I am now paying between $200 and
$300 a month from my own salary."
His pension is more than Medicaid
allows, she said, "so I can get no
assistance there.
"I don't mind his Income being used
for his care, but think It Is very unfair
that I should have to make up that big
a difference. Of course, nursing care
will continue rising, and even m y
salary does not go up enough to keep
up.
"I have checked many sources and
no one has a solution, but It seems
there has to be an answer to this
problem somewhere." she said. "One
solution that was offered was to get a
divorce, which Is a terrible thought."
This reader isn't alone In her predic
ament: The impoverishment of one
spouse — usually the wife — because
the other spouse is in a nursing home is
a major and growing Issue.
State laws vary regarding Medicaid
eligibility and who Is responsible for
paying the nursing-home bill. General
ly. however, you can't qualify for
Medicaid unless you have spent all of
your resources down to a set limit —
which may be as low as $1,500. If all
resources are in the name of the person
being placed in a nursing home, they
must be "spent down” by paying for
the nursing-hom e care u n til the
Medicaid-eligibility limit is reached.
This is one way in which a spouse
becomes impoverished.
Even when the spouse in the nursing
home qualifies for Medicaid, his Income
— for example, from Social Security —
is applied toward the nursing-home
costs and Medicaid makes up the
balance. If the spouse left at home has a
low monthly Income, this generally will
be all she has to live on — and it might
amount to only $350 a month. Th is is
another way in which a spouse
becomes Impoverished.
Lawyers have begun to specialize in
this area of planning for disability and
long-term care, and they recommend
several strategies. However, these
demand advance planning, since most
states require that a transfer of assets
take place two years before one applies
for Medicaid.
All husbands and wives should con
tact the state's nursing-home (long
term care) ombusdman's office for
Information regarding state Medicaid
laws and their rights under the law.
In addition, more states should adopt
laws that treat spouses more fairly,
such as those In California and
Washington.
Since 1981. California has permitted
couples to divide community property
into equal halves, so that half of the
assets can be preserved for the spouse
at home. The spouse In the nursing
home would use his half to pay for care
and would apply for public assistance If
that money ran out. California also
allows a spouse to transfer his Interest
in the house to the at-home spouse,
either before or after entering a nursing
home.
The Washington state law, passed in
1981. Is even more generous: When the
transfer of assets is between spouses,
there Is no requirement that the
transfer be made two years before
applying for Medicaid. The spouse In
the nursing home may transfer assets
to the at-home spouse, who Is allowed
to keep his or her assets.
Unique American Heroes
Many Who Earned Top U.S. Honor Were Foreign Born
Freedoms Foundation Features
The Medal of Honor. It Is the highest award this
nation confers on those mllttay heroes who
perform above and beyond the call of duty In the
service of their country. The patriotism of those
who have earned It is unquestionable: the love
they shared for their homeland has never been in
doubt.
One of the startling facts about the Medal of
Honor, however, is that fully 728 of the 3.414
who have earned It were not born on American
soil. Like millions of other Immigrants, they
arrived from distant lunds: from Denmark and
Norway: England. Ireland and Scotland: West
Prussia. Germany. Belgium. To the great Ameri
can melting pot they added names like Kclicn.
Hansen. Seaeh. Jardlne. Strich. Kraus. McCarthy
and Vtfquain. But all had one thing in common.
They went to baltle for their new country, some
perhaps without even understanding Its language
or Its cause, and In some extraordinary way they
demonstrated that personal courage has nothing
to do with nationality.
Many of these foreign-born heroes fought
during the Civil War. Of the hundreds of Irish
who Joined the Irish Brtgude. 254 merited the

and his comrades defended for several hours
against repeated attack to prevent the enemy
from flanking the Union's position. Later In the
day he and 127 others were taken prison and
suffered untold hardships for 23 months In
Andersonvllle prison. He was honorably dis
charged June 27. 1865. his health shattered from
long confinement and starvation.
Mons Monsoon, born in Bergen. Norway. Is
another example of a valiant foreign-bom hero.
He was aboard the USS Missouri when there was
an explosion on board. Realizing that the ship
would be destroyed if the flames reached the
great mass of powder and ammunition, he acted
quickly. Dashing into the magazine, he closed the
doors behind him and battled the flames. His
successful extinguishing of the fire saved the ship
and Its crew.
While Monsoon’s act was certainly one of the
most heroic on record, other brave deeds by men
of foreign birth are legion. Russian bom Alex
ander Peters, shipwrecked off the Azores. Joined
the US Navy after his rescue and later earned the
Medal of Honor. Others were Robert Klein, of
Germany: Hans Antou Hansen, of Denmark:
Frank Anton Strich. of West Prussia. Alexander
Jardlne of Scotland. Ernest Kraus, of Germany.
All were valiant men Irom foreign lands who left
home and family to seek a new .life and
opportunity In America, became members of our
armed forces and wrote new chapters In the book
of freedom.

In Prison For Th e 'Hell* O f It

like a cry for sympathy. But in
other ways It makes you think of

man in hell.

come to the place of torment to

man in desperation asks that
someone go to his family to warn
them about what hell is like.

Pope Deplores A irp o rt Attacks
By Charles Ridley
ROME (UPI) •Pope John Paul II. deploring the
shedding of Innocent blood during the Christmas
season In the terrorist attacks at the Rome and
Vienna airports, has called on people to unite
their efforts to break the senseless spiral of
violence.”
"Once again In this year that Is ending, there
have been not a few episodes of violence that
have disturbed the life of the city.’ the pope said
Tuesday In a homily at a traditional year-end Te
Deum Mass attended by clergy and city officials
of Rome at the Church of Jesus.
"It Is necessary to unite forces to break the
senseless spiral of violence and to heal at the
roots these manifestations of criminality and
terrorism that disfigure the face of our epoch,
the pope said.
Moat of the pope's address was dedicated to
religious themes, and he called on Romans to
"examine their conscience" on modem attitudes
toward (he church.
_
„
_ , .
Referring to "religious Indifference reflected
by poor attendances at Mass on Sundays and
religious holidays, the pontiff urged parents to
consider It "a serious moral duty” to see that
their children benefit from religious education In
Italian schools. The new Condordat signed earlier
this year between the Catholic church and Italy
no longer makes such attendance compulsory.
For the second time in three days, he used an
uddress to express his horror over the Palestinian
terrorist attack that left 18 dead and 112
wounded In the Vienna and Rome airports.
"Innocent blood has been shed, even during
this Christmas period, with a massacre that has
particularly shaken public opinion and has
caused dismay In every part of the world." he
said.
"Unspeakable sufferings have been Inflicted on
numerous families, and a sense of anxiety and
Insecurity has been spread among the popula
tion."
Sunday, the pope told 30.000 pilgrims and
tourists in St. Peter's square that "sufficiently
strong words do not exist to deplore such
criminal misdeeds, before which the conscience
of every civilized person Is stricken with horror."

trafficking. It was Reed's first
conviction as a felon and his first
experience with prison life.
"Prison." he wrote West. "Is
where one ceases to live and
merely tries to exist as best he
can In an unbearably noisy
atmosphere. It is a place of
frustration and futility, a place of
little hope and much hope
lessness.
"Prison Is loo many days
without beauty or the sound of
honest laughter, l o o much time
in emotional and spiritual dark
ness. a place where true smiles
are rare and kindness almost
non-existent. It is the vacant,
sick feeling that grows within
the minds of those who wait for
letters that never come, for
visitors who never appear.
"Prison Is a narrow steel cell
where one has no privacy, a box
which magnifies the constant,
ungodly noise. It is living locked
In a steel box, listening to the
strains of an old song on the
radio, a song that brings back
memories of happier days that
are lost forever.
"Prison Is a nothingness of
days and nights that never
change, a place where only those
who have existed there can ever
know what a living hell it Is."
This could be considered a
vivid, modern description of hell.
We have pretty much given up
our belief in hell as a place of
everlasting fire. What has hap
pened. though. Is that we have
thrown out hell with the fire. We
no longer believe In hell. Or we
agree with those theologians
who say that, while there is a
hell, there will be nobody in It.
God in his loving kindness will
eventually save everybody.
Others who don't believe In
hell don't mean to imply that
everyone will go to heaven.
Those who don’t go to heaven
will merely cease to exist. Their
"eternal damnation" will be
"eternal death" — non
existence.
But there are a gr owi ng
number of people today who
reject the orthodox belief In hell,
while holding to a belief In
post - mo r t em, non- physi cal
existence In which many will
experience the things Reed
speaks of In his letter from
prison.
For Reed, the "living hell" Is
not physical suffering. He does
not complain ot torture or lack of
food. What is hell is being in a
place "where there is little hope
and much hopelessness... where
there are too many days without
beauty or the sound of honest
laughter... a nothingness of days
and nights that never change."
Read his letter again and
substitute the world "hell" every •«'
time he uses the world "prison.”
According to this view of hell.'*
the sensual person will find
there no gratification of physical craving.
"Th e best analogy of what itwill be like for such a person," ’
says a writer on the subject. '■
"can be found in the frustration
dream we are all familiar wlth..In such dreams, our desires — •
often sexual, but they can be of other kinds — find no fulfill- •
ment."
If It Is true that hell for some •
will be like a never-ending bad ■
dream, the churches that no •
longer talk about hell might d o ]
well to read the description o f ■
hell given by William Reed. No. ,

too late.

U m S s y . Ja n . J, If M
Strongman Pinochet Takes Up Weight Lifting, Jogging
S A N TIA G O . Chile (UPI) .President Augusto Pln#chct. one
of South America’s two surviv
in g m ilita ry strongm en. Is
starting to get in shape for his
next campaign — even though
the election Isn’t until 1989.
Th e 70-year-old army general,
who took power 12 years ago.
has begun Jogging and weight
lining to show his people he’s
still got what it takes to govern.
T h e get-fit campaign was
launched on his 70th birthday.
N o v. 25. Chilean television
showed film of the president
working out In a blue sweat suit
doing slt-ups and lifting weights.
Newspapers the next day
published front-page photo of
him Jogging around the park at
the Pacific-coast presidential re
treat In Vina del Mar.
"Th e president went for a Jog
at 8 o’clock and then did 45
minutes of excercises in the
gym.” said an official communi
que.
The campaign has a clear
objective: T o Inject vitality Into
the aging president’s public
Image and make him look strong
and dynamic enough po govern
to the end of the decade. And
beyond.
Pinochet's term runs out In
1989.
Unlike Paraguay’s Alfredo
Stroessner. who with 31 years In
power is the region’s longestlasting ruler. Pinochet will have
to convince the country that he
Is the man needed for another
eight-year term.
Th e ruling four-man Junta,
which acts as Chile’s Legislature
in the absence of a congress, will
pick a candidate In 1989 who
must then be approved In a
national plebiscite.
Opposition parties,
meanwhile, are pressing for free
presidential elections in 1989.
and even government advisors
recommend an open race be
tween more than one candidate
In order to split anti-Pinochet
forces.
The strong Catholic Church
and the U.S. State Department
are also giving out Increasingly
clear signals that they favor an
orderly return to representative
democracy In 1989.
Pinochet, however. Is In no
hurry to leave the presidential
palace.
The man who led the military
coup against Marxist President
Salvador Allende In 1973 con
tinues to enjoy the full backing
of C h il e ’s w e ll-tls c lp lln e d
Prussian-styled army.
When rumors of rumblings In
the Navy and Air Force echoed
through the capital two months
ago. Pinochet was quick to
answer: "Th e only person capa
ble of leading a revolt in this
country is me.”
Pinochet’s health Is not likely
to stop him from being the Junta
candidate In 1989.
He doesn’t smoke or drink,
and takes ginseng tea daily.

Alternate Waste Disposal Site Unsuitable, City Told
By Korea Telia j
Herald Staff Writer
A recently completed engineering study has
failed to bring Sanford any closer to solving its
wastewater management woes, although It has
demonstrated a willingness on the city’s part to
purse sites other than Yankee Lake as location for
Its effluent disposal system.
In late December, a 2.250-acre tract of property
lying east of Sanford. ofT Lake Jessup, wus tested
by the city's engineers. Conklin. Porter and
Holmes, as possible site for the same type of rapid
Infiltration system the city wants to locate at
Yankee Lake.
However, test results the city received last week
indicate the site’s soil and water densities render
It Incapable of absorbing the 7.2-mllllon dally
gallons or eflluent that Yankee Lake can handle.
City Planning and Engineering Director BUI
Simmons said today.
Sanford’s efforts to acquire a site for effluent
disposal arc to comply with a state Department of
Environmental Regulation mandate to cease
disposing wastewater In Lake Monroe. Describing
the city as ’’a victim or circumstance" In light of
the decree. Simmons said the Lake Jessup survey
"was another try (at compliance) that unfortu
nately didn't workout."
A Sanford resident representing a group of
Orlando businessmen offered the city the Lake
Jessup land In early December for approximately
$5,285,000. Sanford was attracted by the pro
perty’s size, price and distance from the city, all
of which are comprable to the Yankee Lake site.
The 2.867-acre Yankee Lake property Is located
approximately seven miles west of Sanford. ofT
State Road 46. The Lake Jessup land also lies ofT
State Road 46. an estimated six miles east of the
city.
The similarities between the two sites vanished,
however, when engineering test results were
received, according to Simmons. Although he

declined to offer a specific capacity figure for the
Lake Jessup site, Simmons did say Its dense soil
and high water table "took the land right out of
our ballpark as far as disposal Is concerned. Its
ability to absorb effluent didn’t come close to
what we could send out to Yankee Lake."
Sanford made two offers. $5,676,000 and $6.1
million. In efforts to purchase the Yankee Lake
property last fall. The land, however, was sold by

for $7.5-mlllion.

attempt when the countdown stopped 15
seconds before blastoff because of electrical
problems. That launch bid already was 24
hours behind schedule.
"Il was u lextbook-perfect countdown up
u n til th e fin a l nine m in u te s ." N ASA
spokesman James Ball said of today's launch
attempt.
The final blow came when officials in charge
of the RCA television-relay satellite In the
ship's cargo bay said they had to be off by 8:47
a.m. In order to have the satellite deployed
under the proper conditions. NASA did not
have enough time to meet that deadline.
BlastolT had been scheduled for 7:05 a.m.
EST but a series o f snags delayed the
countdown as engineers scrambled to come up
with a way to get Columbia airborne before Its
"launch window” closed.
The request to postpone blastoff came from
RCA American Comrnuulrntlnns lm\. owner of
the $50 million RCA Satcom communications
satellite.

Reagan's N e w Year Brings O ld
Challenge: Anti-Terrorism
WASHINGTON (UPI) — For President Reagan, back to
work after a wccklong vacation, the start o f the new year
brings bark a familiar challenge: a test of his vow against
terrorism Just days after taking ofTlcc In 1981.
Reagan spent a quiet weekend at the White House as
Washington buzzed with speculation on whether his
5-year-old pledge of "swift and effective retribution"
against terrorism would be backed up with action.
The target of this speculation was Libya's radical leader.
Col. Moammar Khadafy. who through words and deeds has
been a constant thorn in the side of the United States
almost since the start of the Reagan presidency.
Khadafv leveled new threats against the United States as
Reagan cased into tin* first full week of the new year. His
only public appointments today were meetings with
Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Henson and his senior
aides.
Behind the scenes, administration officials said a review
of possible action against Libya, branded as a backer of the
Palestinian group responsible for twin Dec. 27 terrorist
attacks in Rome and Vienna, still was underway.
Hart Prefers Presidency
DENVER (UPII — Sen. Gary Hart. D*Colo.. has told his
supporters that his decision not to seek a third term this
year does not mean he will again run for president in 1988.
but he left no doubt he finds the prospect attractive.
"Mere in Colorado, we've seen sendee In the Senate as a
temporary opportunity, not a permanent occupation," Hart
said. ' So now it's time for me to express my commitment
to our st.ite and our nation In other ways, and perhaps on a
farther horizon."
Hart, who lost the Democratic presidential nomination to
Walter Mondale in 1984. announced Saturday he will not
seek re-election to the Senate.

presidential campaign, and It had been widely speculated
he would forego a Senate campaign In order to pay off the
debt and prepare for another presidential campaign In

Few Issues are likely to raise so much
rhetoric In 1986 as the constitutional
amendment to permit casino gambling In
the state of Florida.
This will be especially (rue In SXrmlnoIr
and other Central Florida counties with the
realization that, if passed as written. 25 area
hotels will qualify as casinos • many more
than any other area of the state.
Barely a week after slate election officials
validated the petitions placing casino
gambling on the Nov. 4 ballot, opponents of
legalized gam bling — and even some
supporters — were lined up to voice their
opposition to the measure.
T m definitely against It.” Dr. Freddie
Smith, pastor of the Central Baptist Church.
Sanford, said. "Seemingly everywhere it has
gone there's been crime associated with It. I
would be fearful of the way which families
would sufTcr financially because of its being
so habit forming and addictive. A quick
buck is never a good buck. I have preached
In the Rescue Mission in Atlantic City and
seen first hand how casino gambling leaves
people with nothing. The mission was
packed every night with people who had
gambled away everything and were left
absolutely destitute."
"United Methodist Cliurrh is opposed to
gambling In any form and our Methodist
bishop and the church overall are strongly
opposed to introducing casino gambling In
our state.'* the Rev. George A. Buie, pastor
of First Methodist Church. Sanlord. said. "1
feci like It Isn't anything that would be
helpful to our state or family life. I hope
people In thr different churches and citizens
In the community wilt stand up against it."
Miami Archbishop Edward McCarthy.
Florida*" highest ranking Roman Catholic
bishop sald:"Thc casino atmosphere Invites
unsavory companions Into a community
and an Increase In street crime, open
prostitution, loansharking, corruption of
officials, alcohol and drug abuse, undesira
ble visitors, opportunity for crime syn
dicates to flourish and community de
terioration."
McCarthy had plenty of
company In his opposition to the casino
measure:
—The Rev. D. J. Abernathy, director of
United Christian Action of the Florida
Baptist Convention called attention to reso
lutions unanimously passed by messengers
to the annual sessions of Florida Baptists
opposing all forms of gambling, whether
casinos, lotteries or pari- mutucls.
—Sen. Paula Hawkins. R-Fla.. warned
earlier of u "relationship between casino
gambling and organized crim e" that would
provide "a new opportunity for narcotics
traffickers to launder drug money."
—State Education Commissioner Ralph
Turlington is leading the fight to place a
statewide lottery on the ballot, but said he
would oppose cuslno gambling even If It
means the defeat of his lottery proposal.
—Gov. Boh Graham, who spearheaded
previous efforts to keep the casino Issue off
the ballot, has said he would play a lest
prominent role against the referendum thli
year, but remained firmly-committed to lit
defeat. Graham is expected to oppose
Hawkins in this year's Senate race.
McCarthy said he would ask the Greatci
Miami Religious Leaders Coalition to con
sider the issue at a meeting later this
month. The coalition Is composed of leaders
or Catholic. Protestant and Jewish denomi
nations.
The archbishop also said he may ask
priests In the archdiocese to speak out
against raslno gambling from the pulpit.
McCarthy said gambling was not Immoral
of Itself, but he said casino gambling tended
to strip people of their life savings and to
support society's "criminal element."
Political observers believe that no Issue Is
likely to gain so much attention during the
1986 campaign as the casino amendment.
Supporters — particularly a grntip called
Citizens for Jobs and Tourism — already
have raised In excess of 8600.000 to
promote the amendment.
Andrew Rubin, a lawyer from North
Miami Beach who headed the petition drive
lo place casino gambling on the ballot, said
Cltzens for Jobs and Tourism is lining up Its
own group of public figures who support the
measure.
Nov. 4 will mark the seeond vote byFlorida residents on casino gambling. The
Issur failed by more than a 2-1 margin —
1.720.275 lo 687.460 - In 1978 as

Time Running Out For Halley Viewing
William Harwood
UPI Science Writer
If you live In the United States,
especially in the north, this week
and next will be your last good
chance to see Halley’s come!
unless you plan a trip to the
Soulhcrn Hemisphere in a cou
ple of months.
Comet Hallry Is racing toward
the sun at better than 56.000
mph. sinking lower and setting
six minutes earlier each evening
in January as it heads for its
close encounter with Earth's star
on Feb. 9.
The comet will be lost in the
glare of the sun next month and
on Jan. 17 the moon reaches
first quarter and its light will
increasingly overpower the dim
comet.
After looping around the sun
In February. Comet Halley will
head back toward Earth on Us
way back out to the depths of
the solar system In Its 76-vear
orbit of the sun.
Halley will return to view for
observers In the United States In
the predawn sky of late March
and while ll will be brighter than
it is now. it will be extremely
close lo the horizon and difficult
to observe through atmospheric
murk. On April 11. it makes its
closest approach to Earth —
about 39 million miles.
By mid-April, the comet will
again be visible from the United
States in the evening sky. but It
will be fading quickly as ll leaves
the warm embrace of the sun.
V ie w e rs in tin- S ou th ern
Hemisphere can expect a much
better show.
Many amateur stargazers arttaking advantage ol the January
viewing period. Hocking In ob
servatories and plam-tariums to
peer through telescopes and talk
to astronomers about history's
most storied comet.
Astronomer Robert Wood at
Brevard Community College in

express disappointment after
looking at the deep space wan

servatory.
"'Y ou can't get it any better
than that?’ " he mimicked a
typical observer hxikiug through
the school's 24-inch telescope.
"'You mean I stood In line an
hour for this?’ They expert to
see a blazing object streaking
across the sky."
The 1985-1986 apparition of
Comet Halley Is one of the worst
In the past 2.000 years because
of the relative positions of the
comet and Earth in its orbit.
Even though the view o f
Comet Halley does not match its
reputation, many observers say
being able in sec- it at all is
reward enough for the time
spent.
"1 think ll was th rillin g

TALLAHASSEE (UPI) - Auditor General
Ernest Ellison Friday said two slate agencies
wasted millions of taxpayers' dollars and
locked the state into a costly long-term
contract when they converted two boilers at
Florida Stale Hospital to burn wood in
addition to oil.
Ellison said in an audit that the depart
ments of Health and Rehabilitative Services
and General Services "spent millions of
dollars and wilt likely spend millions more
for a project whieli has to date resulted in
little or no economic benefit."
He recommended the Legislature consider
dropping the project at the Chattahoochee
hospital.
The audit says department staff "grossly
u n d e rs ta te d " the b oiler c o n ve rs io n 's
pricelag and considerably underestimated
the cost of the wood chip fuel.
The final 85.5 million cost of ltie con
version was 83.5 million more than HRS
predicted in 1980, the audit states, while the
six-year. 817 million fuel contract the two
agencies signed exceeded 1981 estimates by
86 million.
The audit does not estimate the total loss
to taxpayers.
"DGS and HRS personnel decided to
continue the project even though data
available to them ... indicated the project
was significantly underfunded and nt litte
economic value lo the stale." the audit said.
The Legislature compounded tlit- problem
in 1984 when it set limits on the amount of
wood fuel it would buy and the price it
would pay. the audit says. Built limits were
lower than was called for in the stale's
eon tract with its wood fuel supplier.
In December 1984, tile wood suppliers
sued iin- state for breach of contract. A
circuit court last month awarded Guaranty
Fuels. Inc., ol Independence, Kan.. 87 95
million in damages. The state is appealing
that decision.
Department staff and the Legislature,
which approved the project 111 1980, also
failed to anticipate declining oil prices would
make wood a more expensive fuel than oil.
the audit states.
In March 1984. stalf told lawmakers that
burning wood instead of oil would cost 81
million more per year. Oil prices have fallen
since that estimate, meaning wood burning
is now an even more costly alternative.
In a written response to the audit. HRS
Secretary David Plngrec said converting to
an alternative fuel supply during the oil
shortages o f 1980 seemed a prudent move.
Both Pingree and General Services Execu
tive Director Ronald Thomas said Ihe
expensive delays were almost inevitable
because the technology involved was still
being developed.
"T h is design was the first of Its kind."
Thomas noted. "A n y research and devel
opm ent p ro ject in v o lv e s results and
expenses which are unpredictable."

Suicide Squads Threatened
By James M. Dorsey
WADDI Al. KH AIR. Libya
(UPI) — Libyan leader Moammar
Khadafv has threatened to send
suicide squads lo "American
streets" II President Reagan or
ders a strike against Libya for lls
alleged support of terrorists.
Khadalv called on the United
States to help ease tension
resulting from the guerrilla utlacks on Rome and Vienna
airports, but said Sunday U.S.
military moves In the Mediterra
nean had pushed the nations to
the brink of war.
"America can hit any place
with lls aircraft carriers and
strategic bom bers." Khadafy
said at a news conference on a
stall1 farm 35 miles west of
Tripoli.
"W e don’ t have aircraft carri
ers or bombers bill suicide
groups." said Khadafy. his head
wrapped In a linen cloth. "W e
would act Inside Am erican
streets but. 1 think II Is a
dangerous turn, madness."
Friday, the U.S. aircraft carrier
( ‘oral Sea left Naples. Italy, on a
course that will take it near the
Libyan coast. Navy planes ar
rived at a base in Sicily, and U.S
warplanes In Britain reporiedly
were pul on alert.
Khadalv again defended the
airport attacks Dee. 27 hut
denied Libya gave support to the
P a le s tin ia n te r r o r fa c tio n
believed responsible.
Khadafy. who was protected
by about a dozen guards will)
machine guns as he spoke, said
the attacks w e re "d ire c te d
against the Israelis." not Am eri
cans.
Authorities investigating the
raids believe they were carried
out by a breakaway Palestinian
faction led by Subrt al-Bannu.
iK'tter known by Ills code name,
Abu Nldal. Khadafy told report
ers hr met Abu Nldal last year.
But the London Sunday Times
q u o te d Is r a e li In te llig e n c e
sources us saving Abu Nldal Is so
ill from liver cancer that he was
Incapable of masterminding the
attacks. The newspaper said the
sources believe the attacks were
carried out by Libyan and Syrian
government agents, using Abu
Nidal's group as a cover.
At least 19 people — including
five Americans — were killed
and more than IOO wounded In
twin Palestinian terrorist attacks
at El Al Israel airline counters al
the two airports.
"We thought this was a stale
ol war." Khadafy said ol the U.S.
military moves. "Therefore we
put Ihe air force, air defenses
and navy on full alert because
Saturday we were prepared to
light without too much noise or
propaganda.
‘ ’ A m e r ic a is p l a y i n g a
dangerous game." he warned.
He also said. "I think It's best
to understand each other and
disengage."
Khadafy said that II war were
to erupt over the Incident, it
would be the fault of the United
States and Israel "because the
Arab nation will refuse to live
continuously under threat. This
Is terrorism in Its true sense.”
Khadafy said last week that
any attack against Libya to
avenge the attacks would trigger
a war In the Middle East and
Mediterranean.
He said Ltbyun officials "In the
past few days" had met with an
American diplomat In a bid to
reduce tension between the
United States and Libya.
Libya and the United States
broke diplomatic relations in
1980 after the U.S. Embassy In
T r ip o li w as a tta c k e d an d
burned.
" lie (the diplomat) suggested
the situation should be defused
and we should start with re
suming commercial relations."
Khadafy said.
Adm inistration officials In
Washington denied that it U.S.
official had niel wllh Libyan
officials or that the United States
w a s m a k I ii g d 1p I o m a I I c
overtures to reduce tension be
tween the two nations.
"W e are not aware of any such

spokesman Bill Hart said.
A rm y Brig. Gen. Mlnnaar
Fourle said fresh tracks were
found Sunday crossin g the
Limpopo River border between
Botswana and South Africa and
"the army docs not doubt that
ANC guerrillas are responsible
for the explosion."
In Pretoria, police said a black
tribal chief. Albert Dlose. was
killed Sunday. He was hacked to
death by unknown attacker.

Selective Policy
Assuages Fears
A Reagan adm inistration polygraph policy
that began as one thing has now becom e
som eth in g rather different. N o problem there,
inasm uch as the latter, m ore lim ited m ethod
o f using p olygraph (lie-detector) tests to
com bat espionage is a m arked Im provem ent
overs its too-pervasivc predecessor. W hat
should bother those in the adm inistration,
how ever, is the m essy, unseem ly w ay it got
from policy A to policy B.
P olicy A. readers m ay rem em ber, was set
forth Iti a Nov. 1 directive signed by President
Reagan. It expanded the definition o f w h o
w o u ld be subject to p o ly gra p h te stin g ,
declarin g in effect that testing w ould apply to
an yone with access to classified inform ation.
M oreover, the directive clearly suggested that
polygraph testing would be used on a random
basis as a deterrent to espionage.
In other words, the governm ent would
attem pt to discourage spyin g by m aking
anyone with access to secrets subject to
random polygraph testing. S ignifican tly, no
suspicion o f espionage would be needed to
initiate a polygraph exam ination.
T h is random use o f p o ly gra p h s as a
deterrent to sp yin g has been used for m any
years by the Central Intelligen ce A gen cy and
the National Security A gen cy. T h e Nov. 1
directive, said to have been drafted at the
instigation o f W hite House C h ief o f S taff
Donald Regan, would in effect have extended
the C IA and N SA policy on polygraphs
throughout most o f the govern m ent.
C ivil libertarians w ere not alone in ob ject
ing to the d irective on grounds that random
polygraphs could invade privacy and Infringe
upon c iv il lib erties. T h e a d m in is tra tio n
countered that polygraphs would be used
on ly to detect espionage. Many in the State
D e p a r t m e n t lin e d u p w it h th e c i v i l
libertarians. T h e Defense Departm ent and the
C IA lined up with the W h ite House. Defense
S e c r e t a r y C a s p a r W e in b e r g e r an d C IA
director W illiam Casey said they would be
delighted to take polygraphs.
T h a t is w h ere the debate stood until
Secretary o f State G eorge Shultz went public
with his ow n em otional dissent from the new
policy. Mr. Shultz declared an grily that he
w o u ld re s ig n th e d ay his lo y a lty w a s
questioned. That effectively exem pted him
from any polygraph and Just as effectively
underm ined a policy o f random polygraphs
lor others in the State Departm ent. H ow could
Mr. Shultz require his subordinates to do
what the boss him self regarded as an affront
to his honor'.’
Faced with open revolt and a possible
Sh u ltz resignation, the W h ite House re
treated President Reagan said neither he nor
S ecretary Sh u ltz w ould have to take a
polygraph test. M ore sign ificantly. W hite
Mouse aides added that only those g o v e rn
ment em ployees suspected of sp yin g would
tie strapped to polygraphs.
T h is w h olesale red efin itio n o f the a d
m inistration's policy is. as we noted, not
without considerable m erit. It retains the
polygraph as a useful, if m ore lim ited, tool in
cou n terin g espionage. At the sam e tim e, a
m ore selective polygraph policy should reas
sure critics and dim inish fears that polygraph
testing would lead to abuses o f individual
rights.
But this reasonable outcom e to the ad
m in istration ’s polygraph dispute hardly va li
d a tes th e h a p h a za rd , e v e n d e s tru c tiv e ,
m ann er in w hich the policy was m ade. T h ere
is som eth in g w ron g when a policy regarded
by the W h ite House, the Defense Departm ent,
and the intelligence com m u n ity as im portant
to national security is form ulated and a n
nounced. only to be publicly opposed, and
eflec tlv e ly vetoed, by the secretary o f state.
A s it happened, rew ritin g the policy to salve
Mr S h u ltz papered o v e r this p articu lar
disagreem ent and its attendant con troversy.
But unless the adm inistration, begin ning
with the president and Mr. Regan, recognize
what went w ron g in this instance, additional
em barassm ents can be safely anticipated.

M cG o v e r n
The Family Farm Is Worth Preserving
Wc. an a nation, have arrived at the point
where a major policy decision must be made
about the future of rural America. At stake is the
question of whether the traditional family farm
structure is worth preserving. If the answer is
yes. then a major commitment must be made to
strengthen the farm economy In ways that are
geared to the prosperity of family operated
farms.
From the beginning of our national history,
most of our farm production has come from
individually owned and operated farms. A
family farm may be defined as one that can be
worked with the labor o f a single family, with
perhaps a hired man or some limited seasonal
help. The one major departure from this system
of agricultural production was the cotton
plantation economy based on slavery In the old
South. In more recent decades, both corporate
farming and absentee ownership farms have
made some strides. But most of our farm
production is still in the hands of familv farm
units.
It has been the belief of most Americans since
the days of Thomas Jefferson that the family
farm unit is essential — not only economically,
but politically and socially, as a basic ingredient
in the American way* of life. "T h e small
land-holder is the most precious part of the
state." observed Jellcrson.
To Jefferson and other agrarian-minded
Americans, the family owned and operated farm
produced a sturdy, stable, independent citizenry
that was necessary for a vital democracy and n
society of opportunity and equality.
It was this faith in the family farm system that
led to the passage of the Homestead Act of 1861
— a measure that made it possible for westward
moving settlers to acqulrr 160 acres of govern
ment land for each qualified homesteader.
These quarter-ot-a-sectlon units defined the
family farm for the next half-century. Later,
with the mechanization and electrification of
farms in the 20lh century-, the size of farm units
grew.
The energy and motivation of the owneroperator. plus the abundance of good land,
technical help from the land-grant colleges and
the Department of Agriculture, adequate credit
and an ideal climate all made the American
family farm the envy o f farm producers around
the world.
But today, the entire structure of the family
farm is under painful pressure. The vaunted
productivity of American farmers has created
more produce than the market can absorb at a
price profitable I d the farmer. An inflated
American dollar, driven by unprecedented
government deficits, has made it difficult to
export U.S. farm products. High interest rales
have further complicated the cost of farming. On
top of all this, recent government studies show
that Third World countries, once believed to be
huge long-term markets for American produce,
are now dramatically increasing their own
agricultural production, thus diminishing op
portunities for American shipments abroad.
What then can be done? First, we must, as a
nation, recognize that If the family farm unit is
worth preserving — and I strongly believe that It
is — we must set up devices to guarantee a
decent return on labor and Investment to our
family-type farmers. There Is no labor union or
price-setting mechanism now available to farm
ers. Only a strong, adequately funded govern
ment system of guarantees can assure farmers
that they will be fairly compensated for their
efficiency and productivity. A second step that
will assist the American farmer is a more
vigorous and imaginative effort to use our farm
surpluses In the battle against world hunger.
Saving the family farms of America Is good
public policy — not only for the farmers, but for
rural businesses, rural banks and rural commu
nities. And prosperous farm families are good
customers for the consumer goods produced In
urban America.

The decision of the British gov

Defense Initiative research is im
portant evidence of the continuing
close relationship between two
allied nations.
This action on the part of I lie
British is more than a wwlcomc
diplomatic development. While Britian is a small country compared to
some states in the world today, it is
rlvh in scientific brain power. It has
a history of innovative research In

Not only has Britain important
science resources but it has men
and women in public life who have
a very clear understanding of the
Imperatives of our time and the
political courage to give the L’nltcd
Slates but who deserves special
praise for his insights Into defense
matters and his persistence in
sounding alarms is MaJ. Sir Patrick
Wall, the outgoing president of the
North Atlantic Assemble.
Sir Patrick, who won the Military
Cross as a Royal Marine in World
War II. has spent the past quarter
century attempting to focus British
and allied attention on defense
necds. He was a pioneer in warning
o f the c o m m u n is t th r e a t in
Southern Africa and in stressing the
need for the NATO alliance to deal
with the danger in the Southern
Hemisphere. He edited two notable
books on the strategic importance of
the Indian Ocean, which the Soviets
long have desired to turn into a Red
lake. One suspects he is too out
spoken to be a Cabinet member, but
Ids speeches and writings over the
years have made a contribution far
greater than that made by any
British Cabinet member, but his
speeches and writings over the
years have made a contribution far
greater than that made by any
British Cabinet member responsible
for defense matters.
Moscow lias launched a global
disinformation campaign to prevent
the NATO nations from creating a
non-nuclear defensive shield that
would protect North America and
Western Europe. The Soviets have
en d eavored to persuade West
Europeans, including Britons, that
they don't have a stake in the
success of SOI.

Iran Runs 'School' For Terrorists
By Jack Anderaon
And Dale Van Atta
WASHINGTON — Iran is training
terrorists to hijack airliners and
kidnap hostages, w’lth special ven
geance toward Americans This
underground warfare, directed by
the Iranian foreign ministry, has
accounted for the deaths of at least
262 Americans since 1983.
Encouraged by the absence of an
effective U.S. response, the Iranians
not only remain unrepentant but
have made Americans their prin
cipal targets.
U.S. Intelligence has pinpointed
two hijacker-training centers in
Iran: one near Mchrabad airport
outside Tehran, the other near the
holy city of Quin. W e've seen secret
satellite photos, which clearly show
commercial airliners jiarked at the
training camps: they are used by
the recruits as "hands-on” instruc
tion material in the methods of
hijacking modern airliners.
The training courses include fa
miliarization with the Instruments,
fuel consumption and other features
of Boeing 727s and 747s. as well as
Airbus 3(X)s. Some of the planes are
on loan from Mchrabad airport
during "down time" between in
ternational Rights
Part of the training is in the
psychology of hijacking and hostage
treatment. The Iranian instructors
teach a cynical mix of techniques
that alternate between brutality to
Americans (to inslill fear in the
captive passengers) and occasional
small kindnesses (to prevent any
desperate resistance by the hoslages).
The CIA has no clear idea how
many potential hijackers are cur
rently taking the deadly training,
hut a Saudi Arabian intelligence
report, which the CIA believes to be
credible, estimates that 55 student
terrorists studied hijacking In Iran
in late 1984 alone. They Included
Iranians. Iraqis. Tunisians, Moroc
cans and Egyptians — and at least
one Saudi. The report identified the
chief Instructor as a Palestinian
guerrilla who had participated
personally in airliner hijackings.
Al present, there are about half a
dozen other terrorist training camps
located In Iran. Several arc reserved
for foreigners recruited by the
Ayatollah Khomeini s agents from
a m o n g M oslem s tu d e n ts and
workers throughout the Middle
East. Asia Western Europe and
even the United States.
Students at the camps get three
months' Indoctrination in Moslem
fundamentalist Ideology as well as
in the nuts and holts of terrorist
operations, ineluding construction
and placement of sophisticated
d e m o I I t i o ii d e v i c e s .

reports of an estimated 30 groups of
women terrorists taking similar
training at segregated camps In

Dolphins Repeat...Barely
MIAMI (UPI) — The Miami Dolphins are in
the AFC championship game for the second
straight year, but the road they look to the
conference title game is quite different from
thr one they followed a year ago.
Last season, the Dolphins were a finely
tuned machine, ripping through the regular
season and first two playoff games before
tH-lng derailed by San Francisco in the
Super Bowl. This season, the Dolphins, who
will play the New England Patriots lor the
right to go to Super Bowl XX. have had to
scratch and claw for every win.
"Last year was almost like a dream." said
running back Tony Nathan, whose 10
catches for 101 yards helped the Dolphins
overcome an 18-point deficit and defeat
Cleveland 24-21 In a divisional playoff game
Saturday. "I'v e never been on a team like
that. It was like 'wham, bam thank you
ma'am.' This year, we’ve had to earn
everthing we’ve gotten ... Sometimes It's
like we dig our own grave, and then we say.
Hey, we don't want to go there yet.'"
The Browns put the Dolphins in a deep
hole Saturday. Jumping to a 21-3 lead with
3:38 gone in the third quarter on a 66-yard
run by Earnest Bvner. That apparently is
when the Dolphins woke up and said "h ey ."
Miami scored the next 21 points to
improve, their home record to 9-0 this
season and advance to the AFC title game
for the sixth time. The Dolphins have never

"W e felt at halftime that we werr going to

Miami coach Don Shula. who celebrated his
56th birthday Saturday. "It was u gut-check
for tts, but our team continued to believe.
That was as tough a situation as we've been
in. We kept our poise and got some drives
going.
"W e felt that to come as far as we've
come, it (a loss! would have been very tough
lo live with in the off-season." Shula said.
"Now we're in the AFC championship game
anti we need two more wins."
Miami quarterback Dan Marino, who
finished the day 25-of-45 for 238 yards, a
touchdown anti an interception, said the
Dolphins panicked a bit. but knew there was
enough time left to come back.
"W e were panicked because we knew we
had to score points, but we knew we had

complete only one pass to wide receiver
Mark Clayton and none to Mark Dupcr.
"There was no need to rush and try to get it

we had to score three touchdowns.
"You Just do the best you can and hope
that it’s good enough.” he said. "Today, it

Happy Rams Are Looking
Forward To Cold Chicago
STAHKV1LLE. Miss. (L’Pl) — Mississippi State University
is expected to name a new head football coach today
fnllowing an intensive search for a successor to Emorv
Beltard.
Athletic Director Charlie Carr, who succeeded Charlie
Scot i Dec. 15. says he will hold a news conference,
probably early this evening, to name Mississippi State's
29th football coach.
Carr is expected to select one of three finalists —
Alabama assistant coach Hockey Fclker. UCLA codelensive coordinator Bob Field or Arizona State defensive
coordinator Larrv Marnile.
ANAHEIM. Calif. (UPI) - The
Los Angeles Rams are as happy
a bunch of guys you will ever
find to be going from Southern
California to frigid Chicago in
mid-January
"Everybody should play at
least one game in the cold."
Rants corncrback LcKov Irvin
said in reference lo the NFC
championship game against the
Hears next Sunday.
The Rams advanced with a
20-0 victory over the Dallas
Cowboys Saturday and watched
the Bears lop the New York
Giants 21-0 Sunday in Chicago.
The Bears played in 20 inpli
winds and the wind chill factor
was 13 below. The Rams can
expect more ol the same next
week
"I think it would be great to go
back to Chicago and have people
say you got no chance."' Rams
coach John Robinson said.
"T h ey didn't think we did at San
Francisco either."
"It's a great feeling to be one
game away from the Super
Bowl." guard Kent Hill said
"But we can't forget about that
one game "
That one game will be against
a team that went 13-1 during the
regular season and bowled over
the Giants Sunday But the
Rams did some bowling of their
own Saturday. Impressing the
Cowboys in the process.
"I'm much more impressed
with the Rams now," Cowboys
quarterback Danny White said.
"Maybe coming in 1 didn't give
them enough credit. They have a
chance to beat anyone. It will be
an interesting game."
The Rams won the same way
they did during the regular
season — with Eric Dickerson,
defense and special teams.
The shutout was the first for
the Cowboys in 36 playoff ap
pearances and the third in club
history. The Los Angeles special
teams forced two ol Dallas' six
turnovers.
Dickerson broke loose tor an
NFL-playnfi record 248 yards on
34 carries, including TD runs ol
55 and 40 yards. It was the
finest moment of a frustrating
season for Dickerson, who fell
from a league record 2.105 yards
In 1984 to 1.234 this season.
Part of Dickerson's problem was
a preseason holdout that kept
him inactive until the third
game of the scaon.
"I think it's a great tribute to
Eric as a man." Robinson said.
"It hasn't been the easiest year
for him. Sometimes you see an
athlete as a man. He fought

Giants' renter Bart Oates snapped
the hall buck to him where he was

23-year-old Landetta reached out for
the hall and brought up his right leg to
punt it the same way he has been
doing since he was a little boy nrst

M ia m i N eglects Street People,
Governor's Task Force Reports
MIAMI (UPI) — Miami, portrayed as one of the nation's
stingiest cities for neglecting Its homeless street people,
will probably remain that way until the public demands
state assistance funds, a state official said.
"There's going to have to be a major public outcry Itefore
the Legislature deals with It In a substantive way." said V.
Sheffield Kenyon, who chaired a governor's task force
which investigated aid for street people.
"Nowhere is the negligence as evident as in Miami." said
Cynthia Hogner. co-director of the nonprofit advocacy
group in New York City. "N o level of government has done
very much to help the homeless in Miami."
The statewide task force created last year bv Gov. Hob
Graham recommended a SUX) million array o f programs to
aid runaways, unemployed parents with children, migrant
workers, mental patients and others likely to live on the
streets. Hot when the Florida Legislature meets in April, it
will consider only S I.2 million of the $IOO million In

Crash Victims Identified
LAKE CITY (UPI) — Columbia County sheriffs deputies
say the victims of a plane crash Saturday have been
identified as two Michigan residents who were returning
home altera vacation In Florida.
Deputies identified the dead as Yevonc Erdnan. 23. of
Fairhaven. Mich . and Theodore Horeftls. 32. ol Algonae.

The two were killed Saturday afternoon when their
single-engine Cessna crashed 14 miles north of Lake City.

to obtain the property, and its representatives
have frequently expressed confidence the action
will succeed, recent measures taken by the city
indicate it evidently has not closed the door on
other disposal options. However, after panning
these alternatives out, all roads lead the city back
to Yankee Lake. Simmons said.
"It's not as though were adverse to anything
else. It's Just that nothing w e've looked into is ns
cost effective," he said. "W e still feel Yankee Lake
Is the only viable disposal site we have within the
north end of the county."
In addition to the Lake Jessup offer, last month
a group of local entrepreneurs approached the
city regarding a methane-agriculture treatment
and disposal system they want In build at Yankee
Lake with private funds. Simmons, as well as City
Manager Frank Faison, have expressed Interest in
the system, although without Yankee Lake and
comprehensive engineering studies, the proposal
remains Just that.
What Sanford docs have in hand are engineer
ing studies that have ascertained property
presently owned by the city eoidd at best dispose

Two million gallons could bo spray irrigated at
the city's airport and. with additional purification

mons said it would probably prove fndtless for
the city to head south, because "T h e farther you
go toward Orlando, the more development you
encounter. It's very doubtful there Is anything out

Columbia Postponed, Again
CAPE CANAVERAL. Fla. (UPI) - The launch of
Ihc hard-luck shuttle Columbia and Its crew of
seven was postponed a record fourth time today
for at least two days because of clouds obscuring
emergency landing strips.
It was a frustrating disappointment to Col
umbia's crew members, who have been on an
emotional roller coaster with repeated last-minute
delays. A fifth launch try was tentatively
scheduled for Thursday.
The crew. Including congressional observer
Hep. Bill Nelson. D-Fla.. had been scheduled to
lake ofT on a five-day mission at 7:05 a.m. EST to
launch a 850 million RCA Satcom television
satellite and carry out a series of experiments.
Nelson's crewmates for the first of 15 shuttle
missions planned for 1986 are commander
Robert "H o ot" Gibson, co-pllot Charles Bolden.
George Nelson. Steven Hawley. RCA engineer
Robert Cenkcr and Franklin Chang-Dlaz. the first
Amcrlcan-Hlspanlc NASA astronaut.
They were strapped In the shuttle's cockpit
more than four hours while they waited for a
break In the weather.
Launch could not be rescheduled for Wednes
day because engineers arr required to Inspect
Columbia's main engines for Insulation damage
uftcr they have been exposed to supercold
propellants two days In a row.

Some might say Steve Davis spreads it on

coating just right when you're resurfacing
tennis courts. Davis and pal Robert
Dickerson, began smoothing out the courts
Monday at Ft. Mellon Park in Sanford.
They'll finish today, weather permitting,

San ford 's probe Into Seminole
County's Yankee Lake land purchase
In relation to the state Government In
the Sunshine law has prompted the
city to ask the county's five commis
sioners and its adm inistrator to
submit detailed personal records re
lating to the purchase and sewer
service
agreement with Heathrow Utilities.
In a 39-Item request submitted In
the county last week. City Attorney
William Colbert called for the officials
to produce all travel vouchers,
personal leave requests, desk calen
dars. telephone logsund appointment
books "dealing with, leading up to. nr
touching upon" Yankee Lake site
acquisition.
The city attorney and co-counsel
Ken McIntosh will review the in
formation with county officials and
attorn eys Friday at the county
services building.
Colbert today declined to discuss
the requests Individually, saying tite
list .“In Us entirety" represents the
unset " o f a very, very thorough
examination of steps the county took
to obtain Yankee Lake."
The documentation was called for.
he said, to provide leads Into the
c it y 's in v e s t ig a t io n o f c o u n ty
purchase* practices and will serve as
springboard for questions the city
attorneys will raise when taking the
d e p o s it io n s of c o u n t y r e p r e
sentatives.
‘...If the county
didn't acquire the
property legally,
then the "sale"
Is Invalid
-City Attorney
William Colbort
"We told the city commission we
would get some answers (regarding
the county's Yankee Lake acquisi
tion) and we're following through."
Colbert sold.
In addition to county officials'
personal records, the city would like
to review the minutes, notices and
agendas of commission meetings that
addressed Yankee Lake acquisition.
Also requested are documents on all
financial considerations made to ob
tain the property. Colhert said.
For u n re c o rd e d v e rb a l c o m
munication regarding Yankee Lake.
Colbert has asked the county repre
sentatives to submit "notes memori
alizing the conversations." .
"W e’re covering all bases." the city
attorney said. "W e’ ve got a lot of
questions and this Is our way o f
getting the answers."
For Its own part, the city com
mission on Monday night Is expected
to holster its efforts to obtain the
property through condemnation by
hiring an attorney who specializes In
prosecuting Sunshine Law violations.
According to Colbert. "Although
the elty hasn't made u formal ac
cusation yet. If the county didn't

Union Chief: F A A Budget Cuts
To Hold Travelers Hostage '
WASHINGTON (UPI) — Proposed budget cuts for the
Federal Aviation Administration will result in declining
levels of alrsafcty that "w ill hold the entire American air
traveling public as hostage." a union official says.
Howard Johannssen. president of the Professional
Airw ay System Specialists, which represents F A A
electronics technicians, said Monday the agency should be
exempt from the mandatory cuts in order to maintain
alrsafcty standards.
The proposed cuts, which could total S I 35 million, are
called for under the Grnmtn-Rudman Act which requires
progressive cuts in spending levels to reach a balanced
budget by 1991.
Johannssen said Congress pared the F A A ’s 84.9 billion
1986 budget by 855 million and another 5 percent cut in
March, as required under Gramm-Kudman. would be a
"fiscal act of terrorism."
"T h e effect of the cuts forced on F AA by the
Gramm-Kudmann law will hold the entire American air
traveling public as hostage." Johannssen said. "T o go
ahead with the planned severe cut in expenditures is an act
of appalling irresponsibility."
Johannssen said the agency's technician workforce is so
short-staffed that he suspects routine maintenance pro
cedures and records are being "pencil-whipped" —

Rail Competition
Benefits Public
C on gress created Conrall Corp. In 1976
from tin* rem nants fo tin* bankrupt Penn
C en tral Railroad and other failing railroad
lines in the Northeast and Midwest. Since
then, the governm ent-subsidized corporation
lias m ade such a dram atic financial recovery
that W ash ington is ready to sell the railroad
to th e highest private bidder. Problem is.
C ongress cannot decide which o f tw o offers to
accept.
T e n m onths ago. the U.S. Department o f
Transportation recom m ended that Conrall be
sold to Norfolk Southern. T h e Virginia-based
con glom erate is offering S I .2 billion and
plans to fold the governm ent-ow ned freight
carrier into its operations that extend east o f
the Mississippi River. M eanwhile, the investm ent firm of Morgan Stanley A Co. is
iffering S I .2 billion for Conrall and plans to
p reserve the ra 'lro a d ’ s indep en d en ce b y
m a k in g it a publicly ow n ed corporation
within tin next five years.
Although the proposed purchase prices are
identical, a closer look discloses that Morgan
S ta n ley’s i> the better offer.
T o begin w ith . Conrall is one o f three large,
profitable railroads in the eastern half o f the
United Stales, with a book value o f in excess
it $4 billion T h e corporation has turned a
consistent profit during the last four years
and has S I .05 billion cash on hand, including
$850 m illion in a cash reserve and ap p roxi
mately $200 m illion in excess funding for the
corp oration 's pension com m itm ents. Conrail's financial com eback clearly d e m o n
strates its litness to remain as an independent
entity.
T h e U.S. R a ilw a y A s s o c ia tio n , w h ich
m onitors Conrail for Congress, concluded as
much earlier this year. Its com prehensive
study predicted the carrier would m ake a
Sl.-f billion prnlit during the next four years,
even allo w in g for a recession that could cause
a dow nturn in traffic and revenue. Numerous
econom ists are even m ore optim istic about
C onrad's future, projecting a S I.94 billion
profit for the corporation through 1989.
N evertheless, the Departm ent o f T ran sp or
tation con tends that Norfolk Southern has the
deep pockets to see Conrall through any
econom ic downturns. But the deep-pockets
prem ise is Hawed because it assumes that
once a business turns sour, the investor will
keep pouring m on ey into the investm ent. In
tact. N orfolk and Southern has not hesitated
to liquidate its subsidiaries when they fail to
turn a profit
A m erger betw een Norfolk Southern and
Conrad would create the nation's largest
railroad system and reduce the num ber o f
major roads east of the Mississippi from three
to two. resulting in a virtual m onopoly. If
Morgan S tan ley's investors bought Conrail.
there w ould be no worry about a giant eastern
■ail m on opoly because the publicly ow ned
orporation w ou ld strengthen com petition
hroughout the region.
An indept ndent Conrail would also pre
serve jo b s and pension b en efits for its
em p lo yees w h o initially m ade considerable
financial sti nin es to m ake the corporation
solvent. On the other hand. Norfolk and
Southern estim ates that 1.800 job s would be
elim in ated follow in g the m erger. Industry
an alysts predict that as m any as 9.000
persons could lost their jobs.
The M organ S tan ley offer, m oreover, would
p e r m it tlit* g o v e r n m e n t to re c o u p an
estim ated $000 m illion in tax revenues by
p re v e n tin g N orfo lk South ern from using
ConraN's valu able tax and financial benefits
to shelter non-Conrail incom e from federal
taxes.
C ongress and the Reagan adm inistration
should th erefore ensure that Conrail becom es
a public ly ow n ed corporation. T his would
p e r m it th e c o r p o r a t io n 's m a n a g e m e n t
structure to rem ain intact, allow the investors
to m ake m oney, encou rage the public to reap
tite benefit In in vestin g in C onrail stock, and

DICK WEST
Canada Rules The Waves (Of Nausea)
WASHINGTON (UPI) — You might think the
rcuscable shuttle program serves no useful
purpose other than cluttering up the sky with a
few more communication satellites, but you
would be wrong.
From out of outer space may come the world's
first hangover-free alcoholic drink. Judging from
the holiday season Just passed, that would
certainly be a blessing.
A fter a study ot spaccslekness. one of
Canada's first astronaut trainees concluded that
the dizziness, nausea and disorientation that
sometimes atTliet the crews o f space ships have
a lot in common with hitting the bottle too hard.
“ His research shows that spaccslekness and
the ill effects o f too much alcohol may be
related." savs one report.
In other words, develop a substance that
protects astronauts from such attacks and
science may give bottlers a substance that
precludes that morning-after feeling.
If so. the space program surely would be
ranked as a commercial and humanitarian
success, regardless of what other spinoffs it
might have.
One reason research of that nature is so timely
right now Is an annual survey indicating that
more corporate em ployees attended office
parties this season than last.
It may be. of course, that some of the convivial
workers were motivated more by health con
cerns than by festive spirits.
According to another recent study, drinkers
arc healthier than non-lndulgcnt types, with
becr-swlllers the healthiest of all.
As one college professor put It. "Either
drinking beer is healthier or attracts healthier
drinkers."
I knew beer could put roses In your cheeks,
not to mention the coloration of the nose, but
this survey found that wine drinkers likewise
reported In sick less often than teetotlers as did
those who favor the hard stuff.
Keep in mind, however, that the latter study
was conducted in Canada, as was the study of
spaccslekness. Those Canadians appear to come
up with survey conclusions that might seem a
mite strange to the rest of the North American
continent, and parts of South America as well.
Keep In mind. also, that the study was
financed in part by the* brewery Industry.
Even so. the prospect of attending holiday
parties without experiencing dizziness, nausea
and disorientation the next morning is bound to
make future invitations brighter.
Meanwhile, fortunately, most companies give
their employees ample time In which to recover.
Of tile companies responding to a survey
conducted by the makers o f Bell's scotch
whiskey, all were closed on New Year's Day last
Wednesday.
Perhaps unfortunately, only about 6 percent
gave their employees Jan. 2 olT as well.
That lapse could be made less noticable by
serving hangover-free drinks.
What science needs to develop now Is a
substance that would prevent office party
attendees from being made to feel dizzy,
nauseous or disoriented by their fellow
employees.
If the space program can accomplish that feat,
it truly will 1m- performing a remarkable service
for mankind.

Supports
Decision
Shop The
Federal
Flea Mart
By Arnold Sawlalak
UPI Senior Editor
WASHINGTON |UIM) - When Ted
Kennedy announced he would not
seek the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1988. all sorts ol
reasons were advanced to explain
why tin* Massachusetts senator was
bowing out.
Here’s another. Maybe Kennedy
was thumbing through the history
o f the D em ocratic Party and,
lingering over the pathetic story ol
William Jennings Bryan, decided. "I
don't want to end up like that."
Tite way Bryan ended up was
being humiliated at tlit- 1924 na
tional convention. A year later, after
the Scopes monkey trial that fixed
his p u b lic im age as a B ib lethumping windbag, he was dead.
Political parties make much of
their dead heroes. Pictures o f
Abraham Lincoln. Teddy Roosevelt
and Dwight Elsenhower often are
the backdrop at Republican gather
ings; Thomas Jefferson. Andrew
Jackson. Franklin Roosevelt and
John Kennedy look down on Demo
cratic conclaves. But not William
Jennings Brvan.
Yet. In his day. Bryan stood
astride the Democratic Party, as the
saying goes, like a colossus. It
nominated him for president three
limes, twice by acclamation, and he
was a potent force in national party
affairs for more than two decades.
In 1896. with one speech — "You
shall not crucify mankind on a cross
of gold' — tite 36->ear-old obscure
former congressman from Nebraska
stampeded a national convention
that was expected to nominate a
senator who had been in Congress
for more than 20 years, in 1900.
despite a thorough drubbing four
years earlier, "the boy orator of the
Plane" won the nomination on the
lirst ballot, and did it again in 1908.
In 1920. he was active in tlie
drafting of the party platform, but
his influence was waning. At the
marathon 1924 convention (103
ballots over 11 days), the man
whose voice once held the Demo
cratic Party captive rose to explain
tils opposition to Alfred FT Smith
and was drowned out in a chorus of
hones and catcalls.
So in ilie premise of tills piece.
Maybe, pist maybe. Ted Kennedy
looked at the Democratic Party and
the nation as they are In ihc fifth
year of Ronald Rcagai.'s presidency
and made the cold, hard decision
i hat ills chance to make a credible
run lor the presidency iiad come
and gone.

DONALD LAMBRO
As Farmers View It
WASHINGTON - Writing a col
umn on a broad range of con
troversial Issues, from Social Securi
ty benefits to corporate welfare,
stimulates a lot of letters — not ail of
them complimentary. But no recent
column has produced as much
angry mail as last month's exami
nation or the plight of some Ameri
can farmers.
In that piece. I complied statistics
from various government agencies
showing that the vast majority of
(lit- nation's 2.3 million farmers are
doing fairly well, thank you. It's that
15 percent or so of farmers who
have borrowed recklessly to buy
more land and equipment who are
tottering on the edge of bankruptcy
— and many will go under this year.
(I is they who are getting all the
ultention from ilie national news
media, and perhaps deservedly so.
Well, farmers — and especially
their wives — wrote letters, and. in
the interest of fairness, here's a
sampling ill tlie ones I've received
from around tlit- country.
Mrs. Elmer Dobherstein of Ellendale. Minn., says that she and iter
husband have been farming lor 37
years, and hmh of their families
farmed as well. They have three
sons and a daughter, and she writes
that "til spite of the oil-Ihe-larm
Jobs, we are barely hanging on. We
are Mill more fortunate, though,
than a good number of people in our
area who have 'gone down the
tube.'
"W h y do we hang on ?" Mrs
Dobherstein asks. "W e hang in
there because we have a deep sense
of responsibility for feeding lh^
world.”
Bui she savs that the nation's
troubled farmers "(at least most ot
us) are not asking lor a government
bailout. We are asking for decent
prices in the marketplace. Then we
could take care of our debts. We
have sold our grain and livestock lor
years without a profit, or a very low
profit. This fall, the price received
for corn and beaus does not cover
the cost ol raising it. Please- rewrite
your article."
Mrs Kemieili Cudel. 61. of Pcrrvton. Texas, lias hern a farmer's
wile for -It) years anti raised three
children, all of whom are college
graduates "hill (they are) not hi
farming?" she writes, apparently
grateful.
Mrs. t ’ udd sent me copies ol two
grain-sale statements, one lor grain
sold in 1973. which earned them
$5.35 a bushel, and the other dated
June 1 1. 1985. when wheat hrnughi
in only $2.90 a bushel
On tite other hand. AT). Cowley ol
Hereford. Texas, a retired farmer,
sees things a little differently. He
writes to sav. "I have just read your
article (and) you're KM) percent
riglil. Our govern men I made it too
easy for some ol these so-called
farmers to gel big loans which thev
knew they couldn't pay hack."
W A SH IN G TO N (N E A ) - The
conservative philosophy Is that the
private sector is good and govern
ment is bad. This leads to tile l>cllcl
that private Industry can perform
nearly any government function
more efficiently, at lower cost and
with h elle r qu ality — except,
perhaps, for defense and law en
forcement.
A llo w in g p rivate Industry to
perform tasks previously carried out
by government Is railed "privatiz
in g "
The federal government already
does tills in a limited way by
contracting out such things as food
ami security services to federal
buildings State and local govern
ments have been even more ag
gressive in contracting mil such
services as trash collection and
public- hospital administration.
When President Reagan was hrsl
elected in 1980. It was expected that
Ids administration would zealously
follow a policy of privatization —
bill tlie Issue was relegated to u
buck burlier.
One o f the few privatization
measures to come out of the first
Reagan administration was the de
cision to sell i lie government-owned
Conrall rail- freight system to the
Norfolk Southern Corp. However,
tills effort was stymied by Congress,
which must approve t lie sale.
Bui now. in the second Reagan
administration, privatization lias
become a major Issue. Dozens ot
individual privatization plans arc
being floated, some serious and
some fanciful. Among Hie proposals;
— Eliminate the present Social
Security System and. instead, re
quire that workers and employers
pay into Individual retirement ac
counts established by financial in
stiiuiioiis and Insurance companies.
— Replace the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation and the Fed

Corporation with a private insur

— Sell to private industry the U.S.

"I'm very pleased with our

Payne singled out Orlando

two players who have surprised
him the most. "W e didn't think
James was as quick or as good of
a defensive player." he said.
"W e knew Efrem was good hut

Improvement, too. has been

but had what Elssele said looked
like a pair of goals called back.
"One goal was called back on a
hand ball and the other it hit the
football crossbar, not the soccer

They weren't bad calls but it was
kind o f a letdown after those two

Marcos for her lack of experience. •
The U.S.-educated Aquino said she would
vigorously press the International Monetary Fund

more goods from abroad while saddling the
people with taxes.
She vowed to dismantle coconut and sugar
monopolies, stimulate Investment tn "laborintensive. rural-based, and small- and mediumscale enterprises." preferably in food production,
and withdraw government from private business.
She told the businessmen their choice Is limited
to "a regime with a record o f rapacity and ruin"
or a "free, open and accountable government that

Aquino, who Is attempting to unseat*President

The most noticeable changes on the new forms
arc In the exemption areas Involving dependents
and alimony payments, according to Art Altman,
assistant director of tax forms for the agency.
The IRS Is now asking non-custodtal parents to
list the first names of children that did not live
with them In 1985 to ensure the children are only
claimed by one party as a dependent. For alimony
payments, taxpayers must give the name and
Social Security number of any person that
received payments.
Both changes, as well as similar provisions for
Social Security income and charitable contribu
tions. were made to ensure that taxpayers are
honestly claiming deductions and listing all of
their Income.
"N ow we have the ability to cheek both the
deductions and the reporting of Income to see If
hoth parts match." Allman said.

"More people this year will be processing forms
... and less Is expected from each employee."
Purdue said, referring to employee complaints of
"quotas” last year that led in some Instances lo
shredding of returns. The IRS last week sent out
87.3 million tax form packages, as always
advising taxpayers to file early and avoid the
common mistakes that yearly plague about 20
million filers and delay processing.

Last year there were hitches with a new
computer, as well as considerable delays In
processing returns at service centers — notably in
Philadelphia where many returns were lost and
tremendous backlogs built up. But this year.
Purdue said, the problems arc under control with
earlier hiring and more training of employees, as
well as new computer programs expected to
greatly enhance processing.
Purdue attributed last year's difficulties to
being "woefully understaffed" at service centers,
as well as tardy training and hiring of employees.
This year's 83.6 billion budget — 831 million
more than requested — should assure "w e won't
have the same problems." he said.

Calls K hadafy 'Flaky'
3-County Zoo
Vote Endorsed
By Seminole
President Outlaws
Business With Libya
By Barak N u i
Herald Staff Writer
Sem inole County Com m is
sioners have come out In favor of
a referendum on a proposal to
finance a new Central Florida
zoo with property taxes from
three counties.
Commissioners voted unani
mously Tuesday night to en
dorse the plan by the Central
Florida Zoological Society to
seek legislation which would
enable a zoo referendum In
Seminole. Orange and Osceola
Counties.
C om m ission ers decided to
back the plan after a group of
local zoo supporters backed off
from Its proposal to seek legisla
tion for a property tax referen
dum to m ain tain a zoo In
Seminole County.
S a n f o r d r e s i d e n t A .B .
'T o m m y ” Peterson said those
who favor keeping the zoo In
Seminole County would delay
seeking a referendum until after
the trt-county proposal goes be
fore the voters.
The group had said It would
ask the county commission to
endorse Its plan, which would
call for a 15 cents-per $ 1,000
p r o p e r ty v a lu a tio n tax In
Seminole County to finance a
zoo at the site off Lake Monroe.
Peterson told commissioners
at their Tuesday afternoon work
session, however, that the group
feels It would be "too confusing"
to put two referendum* before
the voters at one time. Me asked
the commission to delay a de
cision on the group s request to
endorse their plan.
"W e don't think the voters will
do both, and we are asking the
commission to leave the door
open for us.” he said.
If the zoological society’s plan
Is .endorsed through a referen
dum. Peterson said there Is a
possibility that the plans for a
zoo In Seminole County may be
"dead at that p oll*:"
"H owever, the chances are
that the voters will support a
referendum for a local zoo." he

WASHINGTON (UPI) — A new law aimed al taking the
profit out of crime helped the U.S. Marshals Service lock up
32 percent more criminals and seize 8313 million In Illicit
goods last year, the head of the service told Congress
today.
But In a report to Rep. Robert Kastenmcler. D-Wls..
chairman of a House Judiciary subcommittee, marshals
Director Stanley Morris said the 1984 law works so well It
has created "a crisis" for his agency and the federal Bureau
of Prisons.
The federal government Is now forced to hold more of its
own prisoners awaiting trial and sentencing because
already overcrowded state and local Jails no longer have
•room for them.
The result Is more pressure on the federal prison system.
In fiscal 1985 the number of marshals service prisoners
housed at Bureau of Prisons facilities Increased by 16
percent, and by the end of the year the federal system was
42 percent overcapacity, he said.
As a result, "m any unanticipated Impacts must be
addressed If the act's Initial success is to be continued."
Morris said.
The.Comprehensive Crime Control Act. signed Into law
in October 1984. established what Is considered by many
to be the most sweeping changes ever In federal criminal
codes.
The law. Intended to increase arrests of "significant
criminals." deny ball to offenders who present a danger to
the community or might flee, and lake the profit out o f
crime, has been very effective, Morris said.
Cities' Economic Outlook M odest
|
WASHINGTON (UPI) — Although the economic recovery
is still alive in the nation's cities, it is less robust and less
uniform than a year ago and municipal officials fear It may
peter out. the National League of Cities said today.
A survey of 371 cities showed "the momentum of
economic recovery Is flattening out in most of the nation’s
cities and the concern of local government leaders Is to
keep It from stalling." said Alan Beals, executive director o f
the League.
"Their economic outlook for this year Is a good deal more
modest than what our survey found out a year ago — in
terms of their own city outlook and their outlook for the
national economy." Beals said.
Only In credit-related areas — local mortgage conditions
and Interest rates on city borrowing — did municipal
leaders report improvement over the past year.
In other areas, such as unemployment, crime and overall
economic climate, city officials reported either worse
conditions or no positive changes. Beals said.
Only 5 percent of the survey group reported improve
ment in the problem of homelessness, down from 10
percent a year ago. The number reporting an easing of
poverty in general dropped from 12 percent to 10 percent.

WASHINGTON (UPI) — Authorities are investigating
whether a top federal housing administrator picked up at
least 880.000 for private lectures on how to make money In
real estate while traveling on government business.
Allegations of improper conduct by Gordon Walker, a
deputy undersecretary of the Housing and Urban Bevelopment Department, are under investigation by the
agency's Inspector general, al the request of Secretary
Samuel Pierce, a spokesman said Tuesday. He declined to
comment further because the investigation Is continuing.
The investigation is trying to determine whether Walker
billed HUD for trips on which he did little or no offietal
business and whether the trips were scheduled to
accommodate his private appearances at paid seminars.
Justice Department spokesman John Russell said the
matter had also been turned over to the department’s
public integrity section for possible prosecution. Walker,
who makes 872.300 a year at MUD. would face a S10.000

Block himself led a list of
people who refused to blame the
departing agriculture secretary
for the bust of the 1980s; the 29
percent decline In farm exports
from 1981 to 1985. land values
that fell by as much as 50
percent over the same period,
dismal commodity prices and
I he loss of thousands o f farmers.
"Anyone close to agriculture
has been disappointed In the
farm economy In the last three
or four years." Block said at hls
news conference. "A t the same
time, as I've said before, most of
these problems tended to be out
of the reach of the secretary of
agriculture."
John Lewis of the American
Farm Bureau Federation, the
nation’s largest farm organiza
tion. said. "A n y failures he had
were Ihe result of one of the
most horrendous times In agri
cultural history."
Chuck Frazier of Ihe National
Farmers Organization said, "I
rather doubt Just changing the
man In the chair over at the
Department of Agriculture will
cure these woes."
Block saw his own wealth
erode due to the farm crisis and
once said hls farm assets had
fallen by 50 percent.

Van Ore confirmed the ser
iousness ol the disease. "She
(Aretha) Is a very sick little girl."
Van Ore said Tuesday afternoon.
“ W e know what the symptnns
are. hut don't know what causes
them. No one does."
Van Ore said Riggins came it*
the hospital with a flu-like Illness

diagnosed the condition as the
Landry-Gulllaln-Barre Syndrome
and a neurologist confirmed it.
Riggins, wilt) will )«• 15 on
Jan. 1H. then becam e pro
gressively weaker over the next
24 hours. Monday evening, she
was placed on a respirator. Van
Ore said Riggins Is paralyzed
from the waist down and "can
barely move her arms."
Van Ore said Riggins' condi
tion should stabilize during the
next few days.
"W e have made the diagnosis
early, we arc supporting her
(with the respirator) and we are
giving her plasmapheresis." he
said. "Now, all we can do Is keep
our fingers crossed." Van Ore
said the plasmapheresis process
is the removal of certain materi
als from the plasma and pro
motes recover)’ .
Van Ore said although the
medical profession doesn't know
what causes the syndrome, "it is
usually the result of a bacterial
or viral infection." He said it
comes after a one- to two-week
Illness. "It has a history of
following an upper respiratory
Illness." Van Ore said, 'll has
been known to follow mumps,

mononucleosis. Hut it also some
times follows a cat scratch or a
dog bile."
Van Ore likened the disease to
the epidemic which followed the

Flu" innoculatlons in 1976.
"It starts out slowly. Only a
small number will have head
aches or stiff necks." lie said.
"S he (Higgins) doesn't have any
of that. She had the weakness It
starts out In the lower extremity.
It moves from the feet to the hips
to the shoulders and the arms.”
Riggins, who injured her knee
and underwent orthoscopic knee
surgery shortly after the season
started, was suffering from the
llu before she was taken to the
hospital, according to Joe Rig
gins.
" T h e d isease reaches Us
plateau in a week." Van Ore
said. "Hut. II can last for weeks.
Facial weakness can occur. The
reason she (Riggins) was having
trouble breathing was because
the respiratory muscles were
having trouble.
"Aretha didn't need oxygen,
but she needed help in breathing
because of her weakened condi
tion. You have to maintain
airw ay and ven tilation ." he
added.
Van Ore said the danger of a
lingering Illness at the plateau
could result In atrophy of the
muscles. lie added, though. It
was too early to tell what lasting
effect the syndrome may have
on Riggins.
"W e have multiple people

affect her career."
Dr. Jim Quinn, u Sanford

G o v e r n m e n t P la n s T o
B uy S e c o n d M o rtg a g e s
WASHINGTON (UPI) - The
Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. announced Tuesday It will
start buying second mortgages
next week in a new program that
will offer millions o f homeown
ers a cheaper way to borrow
against their home equity.
The corporation — a publicly
chartered company known as
Freddie Mac that is owned by the
nation's, savings Institutions —
announced that beginning next
M onday it w ill buy second
mortgages in amounts up to
$66.6525 — half o f the m ax
im um am oun t o f the firs t
mortgages its buys. The loans
will be for five to 15 years.
The second mortgage loans
will be made on owner-occupied,
one-to-four family properties on
which the first mortgage does
not have a negative amortization
In which the principal Increases
each year.
Homeowners who participate
In the new program will not be
restricted in how they use the
money they borrow, the cor
poration said at a press confer
ence.
Michael Colley. Freddie Mac's
acting executive vice president
for marketing and sales, satd
that based on current interest
rates, the corporation will buy
second mortgages for about 10.5
percent, meaning homeowners
can expect to pay about 11
percent for second mortgages.
A Freddie Mac staffer added
that Its second mortgage Interest
rate will be lower than the 13 to
19 percent interest on home
equity loans being offered by
consumer credit companies. In
terest rates offered by those
companies can vary and their
loans arc not necessarily payable
in a fixed period of lime.
Coffey said the new program
"can have a longterm downward
trend on (second mortgage) In
terest rates" by forcing credit
companies to lower their rates.
He said the program offers
"far-reaching benefits" both for
homeowners, who might use
their equity to finance home
improvements or an education
for their chlldrrn. and for In
vestors who purchase second
mortgages.
W h e n th e n e w s e c o n d
mortgage program begins. Cof
fey satd Freddie Mac wtl! stop
b u y in g h om e im p ro vem en t
loans, which lim ited use o f
borrowed funds to home repair.
For someone whose property
is worth $ 100,000 but whose
first mortgage payoff amount Is
only 940.000, the new program
would allow that homeowner to
borrow $40,000 on the equity.
The maximum loan amount Is
determined by a formula under
which the first and second
mortgage could not amount to
more than 80 percent of the
property's value.
If the original balance of the
first mortgage Is over $150,000.
the ratio Is limited to 70 percent.
To qualify for one of the new
second mortgages, total monthly
debt payment including prin
cipal and Interest payments for
both first and second mortgages,
hazard Insurance premiums,
real estate taxes, any Installment
debt with 10 or more payments,
mortgage Insurance premiums,
homeowner association dues,
condominium maintenance fees,
a lim o n y and ch ild su p p ort
payments should not exceed 33
to 36 percent of the borrower’s
gross monthly income, the cor
poration said.

While the officers chased the
suspect, a police helicopter and
canine teams closed in on the
area. P olice found the boy
huddled in the stairwell of an
apartment building. Carson said
the boy's clothes were recovered
from the woman's apartment.
Victims of what had come to
be known as "T h e Riverside
Rapist" said their assailant was
20 to 25 years, but Carson said
the captured suspect looks like
an adult.

No m atter what you call it. the tax on
foreign oil is a tariff. It is a step into
protectionism and aw ay from free trade. It
would cost consum ers much m ore than the
U.S. Treasury would collect in n ew revenues,
because it would affect the price o f e v e ry

T h e U.S. oil com panies stand to gain

Let's Put Our Money Where Our Mouth Is
" I f Nicaragua can get material support from
communist states and terrorist regimes and
prop up a hated communist dictatorship, should
not the forces fighting for liberation ... be
entitled to more effective help?”
Ronald Reagan put that question to Congress
and the American people, and the answer he
\%ants back Is "Y e s !”
The question is purely rhetorical and the
answer is expected: more support for the
contras attacking Nicaragua. There’s an unwrit
ten blueprint for action against countries that
won't walk the Reagan line.
Nicaragua is one. Angola is another. Reps.
Jack Kemp. R-N.Y, and Claude Pepper. D-Fla..
have introduced legislation to give 927 million
rri non-Iefhal aid to UN1TA. the South Africansponsored terrorists who have failed for 10 years
to topple Angola’s government.
Non-lethal aid frees money for guns that
otherwise would be spent for butter.
Angola's crime is that it harbors Cuban
troops, who keep South Africa's army from
extending Us occupation of Angola's southern
region to the entire country.
Nicaragua's crime la that it has achieved the
first successful revolution since Fidel Castro’s
forces came to power. The Sandinlstas could
establish a precedent for land reform, education,
health care, nbn-ailgnment and general In
dependence that will upset the traditional
relationship between the United States and
various client states In Central and South
America.
Our non-lethal aid proved fatal in 1989 for
almost 1,900 Nicaraguans, including 281 civil
ians killed by the contras and 1.143 government
soldiers.
Despite the reluctance most Americans have
for adventurism abroad, perhaps President
Reagan would succeed if he aimed a t a different
target.
Supoac he asked: ‘‘If South Africa can get
material support from the United States and
prop up a hated, race-based dictatorship, should
not the forces fighting for liberation, now
numbering over 20 million, be entitled to more
effective help?”
Put that question to Congress or to the
American people, and the answer would be an
overwhelming "YES!"
The aid recipient in this case wouldn't be the
contras or UNTTA: They would be real freedom
fighters In the oldest national liberation group In
Africa.
The group, the African National Congress, is
considered most representative of all the forces
fighting South Africa's white supremacy gov
ernment. Founded In 1912. the ANC followed a
policy of peaceful resistance until police massa
cred 69 men. wom en and ch ild ren In
Sharpeville In 1980. They then abandoned
non-violence and adopted armed struggle. They

police, station j>r power, plant, and seem wellsituated to receive the kind of assistance
President Reagan wants to spread so freely
south of our bolder. 1 nominate the ANC as the
first recipient in I960 of assistance from
freedom-loving Americans. They've fought
longer and harder and made greater sacrifices
than any other group currently seeking freedom

Overall,
It Was A
Fair Year
WASHINGTON (UPI) - Judging
from all the year-end pieces IVc
read, most people regard 1985 as a
pretty bum period.
These must be the same people
who are alw ays bad-m outhing
Ebenczcr Scrooge.
I've read Charles Dirkens’ short
story on a number of occasions and
each time I’ve found something new
lo admire about Scrooge. Yet. a big
'majority seems to regard Tiny Tim
as the seasonal beau ideal.
Examine both closely — hold
1985 and Scrooge up to the light,
slosh them around and sample their
bouquet — and I'm sure you will
agree they weren't all that bad.
At the risk of stamping myself a
minority of one. I want to go on
record as saying I thought 1985 was
a very good year. Maybe ll did turn
a hit sour In spots, but a vintage 12
months nonetheless.
Sure there were more earth
quakes. tornadoes, hurricanes,
volcanic eruptions and other types
of disasters titan usual. And cer
tainly those who survived arc 12
months older than they were last
year at this time.
As they say on television, perhaps
those who did survive are a step
slower than they onre were. Con
sidering the surplus of diasters.
hot it natural and man-made, how
ever. they are lucky to get any
playing time at all.
Here are a couple of things that
may remind you of some of the good
things that happened during the
year:
—Sen. Edward Kennedy. D-Muss..
look himself out of the 1988 presi
dential rare, tints strengthening the
field numerically for both Demo
crats and Republicans.
Many a faint heart in the two
parties, most of whom did not relish
a campaign fight with Kennedy, will
be announcing their candidacies
over tlte next few months.
—Congress failed to raise taxes.
Again.
The so-called tax reform bill,
which the House passed under
duress from the president during
llie latter stages oi the first session
of tlte 99th Congress, was still
kic king around in tlie- Senate when
adjournment finally came.
Taxpayers can be thankful, even
if they have to pay more through
the nose to keep the government
running.
Weather-wise. Incidentally, the
Chinese Year of the Tiger came in
more like a lamb hereabouts. Could

RUSTY BROWN
This Hero Was A She
G E T T Y S B U R G (N E A l We
sometimes think that contemporary
women arc the first to struggle
against sex discrimination, the first
to break out of traditional roles, the
first to think we deserve the same
opportunities as men.
Then we hear about women who
were grasping for these things years
ago. Suddenly, we realize that
today's new ideas were long In the
minds of women. History confirms
our conviction and gives us new
inspiration.
This has been my experience at
Gettysburg, the famous Civil War
battlefield. During three days In
July 1863. an unbelievable number
(157.000) of Union and Confederate
troops savaged each other here,
often In hand-to-hand com bat,
around and over Cemetery Ridge.
Little Round Top and Culp's Hill.
There were women here too.
mostly nurses and laundresses. But
a few fought In the lines, disguised
as men. And one woman attended
the sick and wounded as a physi
cian: Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, the
only women to receive the Congres
sional Medal of Honor for her
front-line gallantry. Impressive as
that seems, her Civil War medical
career was fraught with frustration
and controversy.
With a degree from Syracuse
Medical College — where she was
the only wom an in the 1855
graduating class — she went to
Washington. D.C., after the Battle of
Bull Run (July 1861) seeking a
surgeon's commission In the Army.
She was turned down: p artly
because of her lack of surgical
experience; partly because she was
an Infuriating non-conformist. S h e .
insisted on wearing pants.
Rebuffed by the Army, she volun
teered in the makeshift hospital set
up in the U.S. Patent OfTice, fre
quently leaving the capital to work
in the tent hospitals of battle zones.
She was said to be at Gettysburg,
where a local resident wrote: "Her
low silk hat, with bloomers, and a
man’s coat and collar seemed in
variably to call forth a laugh or a
yell from the young boys, and many
a smile and a shrug from the older
people.”
But neither ridicule nor lack of
rank could keep Dr. Walker out of
the war. She nursed the typhoidriddled troops at Manassas and the
thousands of wounded after the
bloody battle at Fredericksburg. In a
feminist magazine o f the times, she
wrote: "1 confess m yself unable lo
see how respectable men can allow
a laundress to go with their regi
ment. and shake their wise heads at
the respectability ' o f an educated
lady acting as surgeon."
A few months after Gettysburg,
she went with the 52nd Ohio
Infantry at Chattanooga, riding
horseback through the picket lines
to treat the wounded. On one such
mission, she was captured by the
Confederates and Imprisoned for
four months. Released In a prisoner
exchange ("M an for m an." she
loved to say), she was eventually
selected as a "con tra ct acting
assistant surgeon" to the Army and
paid 9100 a month. After the war.
she became an active campaigner
for women's right to vote, taking to
the lecture circuit along with such
notables as Susan B. Anthony and
Lucy Stone.
I didn't know the story of Mary
Edwards Walker until I came to
Gettysburg. Here Is where she faced
the guns o f war as bravely as she
faced the hostility of discrimination.
A skin patch that releases small
amounts of nicotine Into the body
may help smokers who are at
tempting to break their habit, ac
cording to researchers at the Un
i v e r s i t y o f C a lifo rn ia at Los
Angeles.
A study of 10 smokers showed
those who wore the patch craved
cigarettes less than those wearing
an unmedteated patch, said the
scientists.
Earlier studies have shown nico
tine gum. available by prescription,
also eases the craving for cigarettes
even though som e p h y sicia n s

For some people, the gum causes

researchers at the university's Vet

Center. The test subjects who used
the nicotine patch reported no side
effects.

is not believed to cause cancer.
A g* and babies
Fewer older women are having
children today than they did In the
1950s. despite a popular notion that
most American women are putting
ofT having children until their later
years, according to a researcher.
Dr. Thaddeus E. Kelly, professor
of pediatrics at the University of
Virginia School of Medicine reports
that In 1950. approximately 14
percent of all women became pre
gnant after 35 years of age while
today only 5 percent of women 35
years or older have children.
Kelly said there is a common
belief that women today are putting
off having children but he said
actually only a small percentage of
career women are waiting until after
their mld-30s to have a baby.
He said his findings, based on
census data, may be why babies
born today suffer fewer genetic
diseases. The older the mother, the
more likely the baby is to contact
some genetic diseases, he said.
New sleep spasm treatment
A new treatment for sleep apnea,
whose sufferers stop breathing and
wake briefly hundreds of times each
night, has been successful during a
pilot study at the State University of
New York at Stony Brook.
Patients in the study wore nasal
masks while they slept that kept air
passage ways open. Current treat
ment for apnea is to surgically
Implant tubes that do the same.

The Nicaraguan government took
umbrage at our report last month
e h u r g in g th a t N ic a r a g u a n
employees of the American Em
b a s s y in M an a gu a had b een
harassed and otherwise mistreated
by Sandlnista officials during of
ficial interrogations. A sharply
worded letter from the Nicaraguan
Embassy here accused us of "d is
tortions and misrepresentations
about the questioning of 17 (em
bassy! employees." (Oddly enough,
our report, based on State Depart
ment cables, mentioned only 15
employees.)
The embassy letter said the 17
were summoned for questioning
because there were "suspicions of
criminal activities and evidence of
involvement with Sornoclstas in the
past" — A reference to supporters of
the late dictator Anastaslo Somoza.
It cited two employees with alleged
links to Somoza's security police,
and a third who "has called for a
U.S. invasion of Nicaragua."
The Nicaraguan Embassy also
denied that the local employees had
been questioned for up to 14 hours.
Insisting that the interrogations
lasted no more than a hour.
Our State Department sources
resp on d ed to the N ica ra g u a n
charges by stating that the embassy
was simply lying. They also insisted
that one woman employee was
f o r c e d to s t r i p , w h ic h th e
Nicaraguans denied.
In its letter, the Nicaraguan Em
bassy said that Bradley Johnson,
who was third secretary of the U.S.
Embassy at the time, could confirm
the Nicaraguan version. The letter
added that Johnson Is now on home
leave in the United States. State
Department officials confirmed this,
but were unable to put us tn touch
with their vacationing diplomat to
settle the matter.

State Department report on the

of 9800 coffee tables and 9200 table
lamps, noting that the Philippines
has "an abundance of Inexpensive
fu r n it u r e c r a ft s m e n an d

halt to the purchase of "expensive
household Items at questionable
cost.”
MINI-EDITORIAL: A recent House
report on the Pentagon's alarming
lack of medical readiness for a
military emergency makes a point
that could apply to other Defense
Department areas os well. Mention
Is made of a planned 450-bed
military hospital In San Antonio, to
cost 9435 million. But there’s al
ready a 1.000-bed Air Force hospital
In the neighborhood that Is under
utilized. Not only that, but San
Antonio's military population Is
mostly retired. Surely that 9435
million could be better used for
facilities for active-duty personnel.

IN BRIEF
Law yer Says H a ll File Suit In
In County J a il Punishm ent Case
PENSACOLA (UPI) — A Jacksonville civil rights attorney
says he plans to file a class-action suit seeking 81 million
for Inmates who claim they were handcuffed and hung by
their hands from cell l>ars In a north Florida jail.
Attorney Llnsey Moore said he expects the civil rights
lawsuit to be filed this week In U.S. District Court on behalf
of Reginald A. Monroe, a young former inmate who says he
was punished by being "hung up" five times while at the
Jackson County Jail in Marianna.
Moore said Tuesday the suit will seek 81 million In
damages and name 20 defendants. Including Jackson
County Sheriff John P. McDaniel, live county commission
ers. guards, the Jailer and a trusty, as well as the heads of
the state Department of Corrections and Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services.
The Panama City X c w s -H c n ild in early December began
a series of stories in which as many as eight former
inmates claimed guards routinely handcuffed young
inmates' hands behind them, strung a chain through the
handcuffs, then hung them from bars on top of the cells.
The inmates, some minors, told the newspaper they
witnessed or were victims of a form o f punishment they
called "hanging up."
McDaniel said he dtd not know of any abuses at the
facility and asked the Department of Corrections to
investigate.

and announced. "Let's do it again." and ordered a teller to
lill his paper s.u k with money. The tellers said it was the
ilnrd lime In a month Frappied had robbed their branch.
The only difference Monday was that he did not get away
with it.
Frappied is in the Duval County Jail, charged with three

Executions D ate Set For Killers
TALLAHASSEE (UPI) — Prison officials have set Feb. 4
as the date death row inmates Omar Blanco and Larry
Eugene Maim are to die in Florida's electric chair.
The action came after Gov. Bob Graham signed death
warrants in the cases on Tuesday.

death sentence in the robbery-murder o f Broward County
homeowner John Ryan during a 1982 robbery. Mann was
sentenced in the I ‘ (HO abduction and beating murder of
Elisa Vera Nelson. 10. ol Pinellas County.

Florida motor club officials are
calling Tor uniform bar dosing
hours, passage o f an "open
con ta in e r*' law , m an d atory
seatbelt laws, and an end to the
m ilit a r y e x e m p tio n to th e
drinking age to reduce the death
toll on state highways.
Representatives of the four
clubs affiliated with the AAA In
Florida said the recommenda
tions were part of an H-polm
package for m aking Florida
highways safer.
They also unveiled during a
Monday news conference a list of
the state’s 11 most dangerous
roadways including one south of
the University o f Central Florida.
The roads listed were in every
com er of the slate save the
Panhandle. The common links
between them were congestion,
drunken driving, poor conditions
and lighting, very old and lmmature drivers or both, and
out-of-state visitors who were
unfamiliar with local roadways,
said Julia M cKnlght o f the
Peninsula Motor Club.

A s t u d y M s. M c K n lg h t
spearheaded for the motor clubs
Indicated 63 percent o f the
traffic deaths were alcoholrelated on a portion of state road
A1A from Melbourne to Cocoa
Beach, where some bars close at
4 a.m. More than one-half of the
accidents happened between 10
p.m. and 6 a.m.
Nine of the 16 fatal accidents
on the roadway were along the
short, tavern-laden stretch from
Cocoa Beach to Patrick Air Force
Base. Ms. McKnlght said.
Unform closing hours and re
peal of the exemption that allows
soldiers, sailors and airmen to
drink if they are younger than
Florida's drinking age o f 21
years would solve much of the
problem, she said.
The state already prohibits the
Ms. McKnlght attributed many
o f the alcohol-related traffic
deaths to "moveable parties" as
drinkers drive from bars that
have closed to others that re
main open In counties or cities
with later closing times.
"Believe, m e." Ms. McKnlght
said, "th e people who want to

authorised by city or county
ordinance.
In Sanford, bars, restaurants
and convenient store, are pro
hibited from selling alcoholic
beveraged between midnight
and 8 a.m. Liquor stores cannot
sell alcohol between those hours
and are further prohibited from
selling between 2 a.m. Sunday
to 8 a.m. Monday. Beer and wine
can be sold Sunday from noon to
2 a.m.
Seminole County ordinance
prohibits sale or consumption of
alcohol on premises between 2
and 7 a.m.
The other recommendations
were:
• An open container law to
discourage drinking and driving.
"W e don't believe alcohol under
any circumstances belongs In a
m o v in g a u t o m o b i l e . " Ms.
McKnlght said. Such a law is
being drafted for the legislature's
consideration.
• A mandatory seatbelt law.
Florida Highway Patrol troopers
are required to wear seatbelts
and If a state employees la in an
accident and was found not
wearing a seatbelt it could influ
ence the settlement, a FHP
official said. Seminole County
deputies have the option of
whether to wear seatbelts while
on duty. Sanford police officers
are encouraged to wear their
seatbelts.
• S a la ry hikes for state
troopers to prevent local police
forces luring them away with
better pay. Florida spends about
850.000 to train troopers then
pays them 814.000 a year to
start. Ms. McKnlght said.

physician says hr was In Cuba at
the time of the operation.
Dr. Celrstiiio De La Heria said
he had nothing to do with the
surgery. He said he was on a
boat In Marlcf. Cuba, walling to
pick up relatives during both
April and May 1980. Brismaida
Husquet said the operation was
performed April 30. 1980.
De La Heria said he did not
bother to appear at the trial
because the case did not Involve
him.
"I don't have to go to any trial,
because I didn't have anything
to do with this.” he said. "I am
going to sue all those people who
have involved me In this case. I
have hundreds of people who
can testify that they saw me in
Cuba at the time that lady was
operated on."
IX* La Heria said he has no
insurance to cover the Judgment.
"T h e y can judge me for 810
million. I don't care. I have
proof. These people wouldn't
dare say these things to my

Husquet. 40. told the Jury and
Circuit Judge George Orr that
she went to the Dade Central

showed the Jury pictures of the

said cost 84.000.
Rubin said De La Heria has
denied from the beginning of the
case that he perform ed the
surgery. But the attorney said he

sent to Uusquet's employers
after the surgery, asking that she
be excused from her job while
she recovered.
major reorganization of district
and regional offices, but Carlin
wanted to eliminate only one
level of management.
"Mr. Casey will not make that
mistake." McKean said, calling
the new mail chief "a giant in
the transportation industry and
a giant in business."
Casey, 65. a Harvard-trained
executive who led American
from 1974 losses of 849 million
to a 8228 million profit in 1984.
said he plans to strenghten the
Postal Service's ability to com

agency's objective since the old
Cabinet-level Post Office De

1970.
"1 welcome this opportunity to

Casey, a Boston native who was
also once president o f the Times
Mirror Co. and an assistant vice
president o f the Southern Pacific
Railroad.
Referring to the frequent-flyer
program he pioneered at Ameri
can. he Joked. "M aybe we can
give you two ‘advantage miles'
for every stamp."
Casey and McKean refused to
speculate on haw long the new
postmaster general might re
main in the Job. saying only that
he "serves at the pleasure of the
board."
McKean, who said the decision
to replace Carlin was made 90
days ago, described the parting
as "am icable." praising Carlin
for implementing some cost
cutting measures, but saying.
"W e think we can do better." He
noted that marketplace changes,
especially increased com peti

Cas;y was chief executive of

Hero Dog Shot Four Times
In Protecting His Master
BOSTON (UPI) When a
gunman pushed his way into the
apartment o f Thomas Perkins,
his dog King was there to protect
him. The German shepherd took
fou r bullets for his eld erly
master and was hailed as a
"h ero d og" Tuesday.
"K in g Jumped on him ." said
Perkins, who Is 77. "T h a t’s how
com e he didn't shoot me. The
dog Jumped on him. He was
right up on him. He wouldn't let
him shoot me. King's got plenty
of sense. He was watching."

remove a .22-caliber bullet from
the animal's left front leg. Two
other bullets will be left in the
sheath of muscle around the
dog's neck. A fourth slug passed
through the dog’s loe.
"Fortunately, these bullets hit
nothing but muscle mass," said
David J. Scanzonl. a spokesman
for the Massachusetts Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to

the dog if it had hit his head or
any of his vital organs."

watch the sport, which Ls the
most popular one on earth, and
follow the county teams as muc h
as possible.
The c alibre of soccer displayed

The final score was Lyman 2.

turned off when they see such

But those people should study
the whole game Instead of Just

There were very few runaways
I11 the Burger King Tournament
which Is u testimony to (he top
notch-defenders that were on
hand.
Three of the top defenders In
the state competed in Saturday's
final Including Lyman's Karen
Abcrnethy and Lake Brantley's
Rcetile Dcaver and Pam A n
derson.
Abcrnethy. a junior, was all
stale last season. The talented
sw eeperbac k has mast ered
almost every aspect o f the game.
Abcrnethy puts plenty of [xiwcr
Into her long kicks which take
the opposing offenses oul of
scoring position. And. more
often than not. her long kicks are
pinpointed (o a teammate who
can then turn it upheld or pass
off to give Lyman an offensive
threat.
Abcrnethy. who was an AllT ou rn am en t s e lec tio n , also
handles the ball well and knows
when to dribble and when to
pass off. She also heads the hall
as accurate and as fur as Just
about anyone. And she can also
score when she is In position.
"K a r e n (A b crn eth y ) really
moves the ball well." Barnes
said. "S h e’s a very smart and
uggresslve player and has a
really strong foot."
Dcaver. Just a sophomore,
used the tournament to establish
herself as one of the premier
defenders In the state. In a 3-1
victory over Vero Beach. Deaver
took away almost every offensive
threat Vero mounted. She also
turned In an excellent effort

I had a nice long talk with Randy
Uy a few days ago. Kelly, along with
ng one of the top doubles player In
area. Is an administrator and boys’
nnls coach at Lake Mary High
hool.
This Is Kelly’s second year as tennis
h at the school and If everything
Into place this year’s team should
at least as good and probably better
o last year's fine team.
There will be close to 30 boys trying
t for this year’s team. That, In Itself,
a remarkable number. Many schools
not have that many players trying
t for their football teams.
Lake Mary High, though, la rich In
nis talent and tennis tradition. In
few short years that the school has
n In existence. It has built a
tation as one of the taro or three
tennis schools In Centra) Florida.
This year will be no exception. A
look at some of the returning players
points out why most high school
coaches In the area pick Lake Mary to
finish In the top three.
Returning from last years varsity are
some really solid performers, led by
the "Big Three" of Trey Seibold. Shea
Whlgham and Mike Renaud. These
three young men all had excellent
campaigns In '89 and all have Im
proved over the summer.
Who will play No. 1? Well, at the
present time. It's a battle with
Whlgham perhaps slightly ahead. It
doesn’t really matter, though, because
with these three young ment Lake
Mary will be very solid In the top three
slots.
Actually, things don't drop off much
at No.
4. If H.T. “
Bennett keeps
‘
Larry
Castle
Improving at the rate he has been
going, he will be one of the top No. 4
players around. He could even move
Into the No. 3 or No. 2 spot.
Stephen Ho Is back from last year’s
team and along with Todd McDonald
will give the Rams a lot of experienced
depth. Tom Boyser and Brian Harris
will probably be the other two mem
bers of the varsity and both are
excellent players In their own right.
Kelly got things cranked up as soon
as school started. Practice began on
Jan. 6 to get the guys ready for the
very tough season ahead. There are 16
matches along with the conference and
district tournaments. All in all It will
be a very lough and Interesting year
for the Rams men’s tennis team.
Susan Whelchel has moved back to
Sanford and has also moved back into
coaching as the Lake Mary girls'
coach. Susan coached al Seminole
High School 10 years ago and now
after all those years out of coaching
has decided to give another go.
In this writer’s opinion. Principal
Don Reynolds could not have made a
better choice. Coach Whelchel is a very

So. Tuesday night, Payne

mildly.

Lake-Sumter had come back
from a 20-polnt deficit to pull

In the first half.
SCC got four free throws after
ShafTer's tirade and Landed hit

the second half to the tune of a
113-68 victory before 101 fans at
the SCC Health Center.
"Shaffer Is the key to their
whole team." Payne said. "Mike
(Landed) did a great Job on him
and hud him frustrated. Lan
d e d 's defense was probably
some indication to what hap
pened (Shaffer's ejection)."

Lake Sumter had just six players

"Lake-Sumter beat us here

" W e ’ re looking forward to

and It was no different Tuesday.
We were in the game until they
went crazy In the final two
minutes."
The Rams used three suc
cessive steals by Kay Hartsflcld

shave the Bartow deficit to four
points with two minutes re
maining but the Tigers used
some good foul-line prowess (13

good player, an experienced coach and
a quality person. She will add much to
the Lake Mary program and to high

Susan has five girls returning from

Stewart, who should be one o f the top
girls In Central Florida this year, and
other holdovers Heather Bennett.
D'Anna Haynes. Erin Higgins and
Kerry Marshall, the Lake Mary girls
appear to be In for a really fine season.
No position on the girls team are
actually set at this time. There are 16

Good luck to both teams out Lake

Umite4 Praaa International
The Miami Dolphins* Rash will
have to evade the New England
Patriots* muscle Sunday If the
Dolphins are to continue their
offensive hot streak Sunday In
the AFC championship game at
the Orange Bowl.
The Dolphins' offense revolves
a r o u n d q u a r t e r b a c k Dan
Marino's ability to get the ball to
his wide receivers. The Patriots*
defense shoots for the big play —
w h e th e r that be sa ck s by
linebacker Andre Tippett and
defensive end Garin Veris. or
turnovers by safety Fred Marion
or c o r n e r b a c k R a y m o n d
Clay born.
"W e go Into every game think
ing we need five turnovers." said
Marlon, who had seven in
terceptions and three fumble
recoveries to help the Patriots to
a league-high 47 regular season
takeaways.
"When you go in thinking like
that, you have to strip the hall
and you have to attack It.
Anytime you give your offense
the ball that much, you're going
to be successful."
The Dolphins give up the ball
a lot — 21 times on Intercep
tions. 20 on fumbles. But they
also have the quickest-striking
offense after the San Diego
Chargers. When Marino has time
to hit Mark Clayton. Mark Duper
and Nat Moore — like In the
2 1-polnt second half that led to
Saturday's 24-21 com eback
triumph over Cleveland — no
secondary can stop him.
Giving Marino time Is essential
for Miami. The Dolphins usually
do; they've allowed a league-low
19 sacks. But five of them came
in two gam es against New
England — three by AFC sack
leader Tippett — as the Patriots
slowed Miami's passing game.
"T h ey’ve got a great, solid
front-seven." Dolphins offensive
line coach John Sandusky said.
"It's hard to find anything
wrong with those guys They're
a solid leant defensively You're
going to have to work."
The Dolphins probably won't

to No. lOSt. John's.
In their previous two games,
the Rcdmen survived overtime
to emerge with victories. Tues
day night, they visited Boston
with nine players in uniform,
and the Eagles made certain
they did not escape unscathed.
" W c d o n 't use the term
'tired.'" St. John’s head coach
Lou Carncsecca said after BC's
79-77 victory. "W c Just need
rest."
R oger McCready scored a
game-high 29 points. Including a
3-point play with 3:43 left in
overtime that gave the Eagles
the lead for good.
"It means lot to us." McCready
said. " If we didn't show the

H a rro d 's P lu n g e s In to U .S . C o o k b o o k M a r k e t
By John DeMers
UPIPood Editor
LONDON IUPI) - M arilyn
Aslant was getting weary or
f r i b b l i n g out her f avori te
lt(igll9tr~recfpcs for Americans
visiting elegant Harrod's de
partment store In Knlghtsbridge.
So Aslanl, who already kept
busy enough coordinating chef
d e m o n s t r a t i o n s In t h e
kaleidoscopic Food Halls, took It
up o n h e r s e l f to c o n v i n c e
Harrod's It should publish u
cookbook.
.Basing her work on early years
around her parents' country
restaurant and later adventures
In exotic parts of the world, she
envisioned a book that would
please readers In both Great
Britain and the United States
while reflecting her employer's
sophisticated tastes.
” So many Americans have
British roots." she sold. "Yet the
book isn’t only about English
food. I also thought of what the
store stands for today — with
foods from the Middle East, from
Greece, from Japan.
" I wrote the book the way !
cook, the way a lot of people
.cook.-They.-tastc-somethlnfL Inone country and want to try it at
hom e. I cook as a sort o f
hod gep od ge of recipes,
especially now that those ingre
dients have become available."
Aslani's method of recipe dev
el opment was a little un
o r t h o d o x . and e x t r e m e l y
personal.
After outlining the work ac
cording to the Food Halls' design
— dividing it Into Meat Hall.
Provisions Hall. Fruit and Vege
tab le Hall, B akery, C o n fe c
tionary Hall and Pantry — she
devised from memory and Imag
ination recipes using the pro
ducts displayed so regally in
each.
She purchased all the Ingre
dients at Harrod's (though she
Insisted for practicality they be
available elsewhere}, went home
and cooked until she got each
dish the way she wanted It.
Aslanl expressed a certain
surprise at the difficulty of it all.
even for a globetrotting gourmet
a n d —a -season ed fo o d p ro
fessional. Tasting great, she
learned, was not enough in a
world that demanded dramatic
appearance and. most of all,
consistency.
" I f I rolled out a piece of
pastry. ! had lo have a tape
measure or a ruler with me." she
says. "It was only after suc
cessful lasting that I settled
down to write It all ou t."
"The Harrod’s Cookery Book”
keeps Its distinctive English
flavor even In the American
edition, published by Arbor
House at $25. Aslani's spirited
history of Harrod's and the 100
or so photographs make It a
popular colTeetablc book as well
as a fine souvenir.
All the same, the U.S. edition
departs from its roots In one
alt-important way — working out
each recipe with American In
gredients and measurements.
Even In London. Harrod’s tries
to direct Americans to a mail
order process that will supply
them the book they can use
most easily.
In addition to British wonders
like scones, Dundee Cake and
Treacle Tart, the book's more
than 300 recipes Include simple
yet sophisticated variations on
French. Italian, Middle Eastern
and West Indian cuisines.
The goal, according to Aslanl.
Is not so much to celebrate
Harrods as to reflect the lifestyle
it embodies on a global scale.
Only the best will do. In Scottish
smoked salm on and French
crepes Just as In wool sweaters
and designer neckties.
" I ate m y way through the
store." Aslanl said, swirling
through the Food Halls on an
impromptu tour. “ I've become
very spoiled because everything
is of such a fine quality. And the
vagety is quite staggering."
N o n e w k id o n a n o w fashionable block. Harrods was
deeply involved In food from its
origins 136 years ago.
Henry Charles llarrod
purchased a small grocery busi
n ess In n o n c -to o -d c sira b le
Knlghtsbridge and began the
labor that would turn his namc' sake Into one of London's most
visited attractions — no small
feat In a city alrcudy boasting
the Crown Jewels. Buckingham
Palace and the British Museum.
The slogan from the start was
"Enter a Different World." and
today the numbers involved are
staggered.
Old Henry's little grocery now
takes up 4 'A acres, seeming
m ore a small town than a
d e p a r t m e n t st or e. T w e l v e
entrances lead shoppers to 230
selling departments, where they
will be serviced by more than
4.000 employees.
On any given day. as many as
30.000 people stroll through
Harrods' doors, with another
19.000 placing orders by tele
phone.
Aslanl has devised more than
300 recipes from almost plain to
dcvastatlngly fancy, each In
tended to reflect, promote and
ultimately celebrate a type of
food and a style of service rarely
found outside the posh depart
ment store's Food Halls.
Each of the Food Halls pro
spered from its beginnings —
despite two world wars, various
bouts of severe rationing and
perennial staff shortages. Few
changes were made until the
1970s. when a pair o f refits
resulted In 50 percent more
space for a total of 45,000 square
feet.
Today's Food Halls — selling
500 pounds of pasta a week,
showing off 500 types of cheese
and 170 varieties o f bread,
stationing 30 butchers behind Its
counters and rebuildin g its
eye-catching fish sculpture each
morning at 7:30 — were of

African Breweries produce 66.8
million gallons per year.
Nigerians guzzle about 4.9
gallons per person per year. In
Zambia consumption Is about

Beer drinking In public bars Is
often a sign o f st and wealth. In
the tiny central African state of

breweries keep on brewing with
only a minimum loss of quality
In most cases.
Throughout Ethiopia's killer
fam ine Its Awash breweries
produced an excellent if some
what malty-tasting bottled beer
called Mehta.
. The government brewery In
Chad, arguably the poorest
country on the continent and
still on a war footing with Libyan
troops on its border, makes a
pleasant and rather light brew
known as Gala Ale. It comes in a
green bottle with a rather drab
label saying "X X X " — nothing
more.
There are problems. In beercrazy Zambia, each unlabcled
bottle Is held up to a light before
opening, a final quality control
check for Insects and sediment
that make about one in ten
bottles undrinkable.
Cash-strapped governments

durance o f brewers. Ghana's
Kumasat Breweries Is one of the
single largest contributors to
state coffers — It paid 73 percent
o f Its gross turnover In taxes,
totalling $ 6 million. Yet In spite
of frequent power cuts, machine
breakdowns In Its 25-year-old
plant, acute shortages of bottles
and labels, the brewery made a
net half-mllllon-dollar profit last
year.
Because of a desperate bottle
shortage, state-controlled Zam
bian Breweries offers $20 for a
case of empties.
But still there Is not enough
beer lo satisfy demand. Despite
its relatively poor quality, a
thriving black market has devel
oped for Zambia Breweries' "no
name" — or rather, "n o label" —
beer. It sells on the black market
for more than six times the
government-regulated price, in
sects and all.
Breweries throughout Africa
are one of the largest employers
In the private sector.
But the bottom line, according
to African beer drinkers, is that
the local brew is better than its
watery American cousin. And at
lower prices than its European
big brother.

January is National Soup
Month, so named by a leading
soup company, because more
people eat soup during this
month than any other month. In
one year Americans consume 10
billion bowls. Now thats a lot of
soup! How much of that Is
homemade we have no way of
knowing, nor do we know how
much Is made or heated In the
microwave oven, but that's not
not really important. What Is
Important Is that you can make
a variety of great lasting soups
using your microwave In much
less time than the conventional'
m eth od s. Soups should be
cooked covered In a container
that is twice the volume of the
Ingredients so that the mixture
docs not boll over. Cream soups
need more thickening than the
conventional recipe because
there Is less moisture evapora
tion during cooking. Soups con
t ai ni ng dehydr at ed rice or
noodles need to be cooked on a
lower setting (30%-50%) to allow
the starch to rehydratc and
soften.

homemade soup Is. Serve with a

(She and Clyde's daughter were
college friends.| Lydia said it was
‘ nothing serious so I shouldn't
icveii mention it to Clyde. She
Cwas so casual about it. I was
/stunned.
Now I don't know whether to
.go through with the wedding,
‘ discuss it with Clyde, or what.
I love this man and want to

"You take (he high road and
I’ll take the low road" Is the first
line of a well-known Scottish
ditty. It might serve equally well
as the opening sentence of a
proclamation addressing medi
cal care In the 1990s. This
country, through Its government
agencies and industrial complex,
seems Increasingly more Intenl
upon de v e l o pi ng a tw o-tier
system o f health care. The
reason for this abomination Is
profit; the name of the game Is
The Medical Industry.
Prof. Robert Massey,
(chairman of the Department of
ty o f Connecticut School of
Medicine) writes in Connecticut
Medicine: "Money has become
the measure and profit the only
legitimate goal In the world of
the great corporate conglomer
ates: that medicine and the
Institutions of medicine should
by Art Santom be follow ing so rapidly and
eagerly In that direction Is unex
pected and troubling." This ori
entation signals a startling shift
In health-care policy. Doctors are
being encouraged — at times,
actually forced — to move from a
humanistIr■scientific approach
to an I n d u s t r i a l - e c o n o m i c
posture.

England Journal of Medicine. Dr.
St e v e Freedman describes

therapists, pharmacists — most
important, patients — will have

where and to what extent medi
cal care will be delivered. Highlevel care will be available to
by Howl* Schnaldar those persons who are either
very rich or who will be covered
by blanket cost-effective insur

tients will not be covered and
will be able to obtain only the
most rudimentary level of medi

view of equal access for all

Sullivan Can't G et Enough News
NEW YORK (UPI) - Kathleen
Sullivan would like a vacation.
She also would like to scr the
sunrise. And next year, she
would Just as soon not spend
Christmas in a New York hotel
room.
i But getting up at 3 a.m. every
morning, working six days a
•week and spending Christmas
;away from home arc all In a
’day's work for Sullivan, who
iro-anchors ABC’s "W orld News
•This Morning" and for the last
year has anchored "W orld News
ISaturday."
" I love It." she said of her Job
in general, and of the year she
Just completed on "Saturday."
where she has more opportunity
to do features and sports than on
the weekday newscasts.
“ Right now l ‘m working six
days a week at least." she said In
an Interview. "On my days off I
end up doing interviews and
stories In other places that use
up my off-air time. It’s been
really hectic.
"F or ‘World News This Morn
ing' 1 usually get up at 3 a.m.,
we have a little editorial meeting
every morning, between 4 and 5
a.m.. after we have read in. Then
we are on the air at 6 a.m.
"It's emotionally and physi
cally very debilitating to get up
In the middle o f the night. I had
one day oiT last week. Was it
Sunday? I had Sunday morning
off and I got up at 6:30 in the
morning and I said, 'You mean
It's dark at 6:30?' I had no Idea
the sun was coming up that late.
Sunrise Is an Important part or
the day and I do miss It."
Sullivan may sound wistful
when she talks about sunrise, or
about the fact that her private
life ranges from "nonexistent to
minute,” but she sounds totally
enthusiastic about her work.
Asked whether she had a
favorite story she had worked
on. she said no and then volun
teered:
"There was the day I was
working on three stories and
editing a fourth. I was doing a
Geneva summit advancer, doing
another on the Treasures of
Great Bri tai n e x h i b i t , and
another on a drug abuse clinic,
while I was editing another."

English Town Unlikely Spot
For Honoring Duke Ellington
in M n n v it iD h

........................
LONDON |UPI) - Probably the least likely place
for a convention on the late Duke Ellington and
his music Is the mill town o f Oldham In England’s
Industrial "Black Country.*’
Yet a Tew months ago "Ellington ’8 5 " went
precisely there. A television team followed It. and
the resulting documentary on this odd phenome
non shows it got more than it bargained for.
"Take Jimmy Hamilton, who played clarinet in
Ellington's band for 26 years." said director Tony
Bullcy.
J
"H e ’s 72 now. But not only did he play In the
convention’s pickup band as tr he were In his 20s.
W e sat him down, turned on the camera and
lights. I asked a simple question and whamt
"Jim m y went on for 91* minutes. Ask another
question, another 9>/i m inutes. M arvelous
anecdotal stuff.”
Hamilton's recollections o f the Ellington band
and era are preserved In B u lk y’s documentary
"Duke Ellington - Love You Madly." screened In
England recently. The show wasn’t at all what
Hullcy set out to make.
"W e went to Oldham to do a brief regional
documentary on the convention." he said In an
interview. "Bui we kept getting so much great
» ‘ ulT It stretched and stretched Into a nation-wide
hour."
.
One story he could not leave out was the way
the International gathering o f ElllngtonphJIcs who s e pr e v i ous t wo g a t h e r i n g s we r e In
Washington and Chicago - came to pick the
unlikely location of Oldham in the first place.
"V ery simple, really." Bulley said. "Eddie
Lambert, who probably knows more about Duke
Ellington and his music than anyone on earth,
lives in Oldham . He w ent to last y ea r's
convention In Chicago and Just invited everyone
to come to his home town for their next m eeting."
So they did. from the United States and
Australia, from France and Denmark, all to
celebrate — and re-create — the music o f Edward
Kennedy "D uke" Ellington, "th e most popular
and prolific (azz composer of the century."
Oldham didn't much get Involved in the
three-day convention "as a town." Bulky said
But the schoolchildren of the Oldham Swing
Band did gel to play "Take the A Train" before an

International audience of prominent experts —
and Bullcy’s cameras.
Besides, there were capacity audiences for
concerts by a specially formed l>and which
swlnglngly Imitated the Ellington style, helped by
some o f the Duke’s own musicians.
Jim m y Hamilton and trumpet veteran W illie
Cook Joined the IKind for Ellington classics like
"Echoes of Harlem" and "C Jam Blues." The
cameras also caught Jazz soprano Alice Baba
singing one of her memorable Ellington numbers
and improvising a seat "Happy Birthday" to
Hamilton.
Such on-the-spot moments arc paired with
archive film or Ellington jH-rrormlng his composi
tions from 1927 to the 1970s. Researchers at
Granada Television. Ihe producing company, dug
up some startling rarities.
Ellington, for example. Is shown playing
"Single Petal of a Rose" — a composition
virtually no one ever heard Ix-fore his death In
1972. '
" I t ’s part of ’The Queen's Suite.'” Bulky said.
"Ellington composed Ibis suite as a present for
Queen Elizabeth. He recorded the whole thing,
with a full orchestra — and then had exactly one
pressing made of the recording.
"H e gave that one lo Ihe queen, and ordered
that no more be made imlil he died."
Bui surprised researchers discovered that
Ellington had played "Petal of a Rose" In a studio
of the Granada company itself many years ago —
and a primitive video recording had been made.
It's In the show.
So Is an antique black-and-white film of
Ellington's band playing "Flamingo.” with Hrrb
Jeffries on ihe vocal.
"That song has never left me for 40 years."
Jeffries says In ihe program. "I cannot gel off a
stage without singing ll: I cannot perform
anywhere and leave it out."
" L o v e You Ma d l y " Is a cel ebrati on o f
Ellington's matchless output and his musical
style, hut ll doesn't suit-pedal his treatment o f the
men and women who helped him make music.
"H e was really hard on musicians." says
Jeffries. "H e was a taskmaster. But he was even
harder on singers, ttcrausc lie wanted them to be
Ihe voire he did not have."

bond and stock markets.
Concern that the Gramm-Rudman-Holllngs
amendment to balance the federal budget by
1991 could be declared unconstitutional also
helped unnerve the market, said Monte Gordon of
Dreyfus Corp.
Gordon said the day’s action demonstrated the
market’s enormous volatility and vulnerability.
"People have been looking over their shoulders
for u correction, and when the market began to
give way. they got nervous." he said.
Analysts said the bond market underwent a

A s ta te D e p a rtm e n t o f
Environmental Regulation of
ficial said today Sanford will
probably lose Its most recent bid
to continue dumping effluent In
Lake Monroe and will have to
wait until next fall for an ap
pellate court ruling If choosing to
pursue the matter.
D E R S e c r e t a r y V ic t o r ia
Tschlnkcl is expected to hand
down a final decision Feb. 8 on
Sanford’s effort to overturn a
state administrative hearing of
fice ruling that sided with the
DER In mandating the city to get
Its wastewater out of the lake.
Because Sanford had to submit
Its rebuttal to the same agency
the administrative hearing of
ficer sided with. " I t ’s very
doubtful the decision will be
overturned." according to DER
deputy general counsel Deborah
GclzofT. " I ’m not saying It’s
Impossible, but I haven't seen it
happen in five years."
This raises the question of
whether Sanford would seek
appellate court approval for
what city representatives term
"an optional" wastewater man
agement program. The city has
given priority to trading Lake
Monroe for land surrounding
Yankee Lake as its effluent
disposal site, although obtaining
the new location has led to an as
yet unresolved legal battle with
Seminole County, which Just
bought the property.
Ms. Getzoff said the DER is
aware of "th e difficult position"
Sanford is In and that "a de
cision (to challenge the DER
ruling in appellate court) and the
costs it would Involve are mat
ters that lie with the city ."
Under an appellate review.
Sunford and the DER would
submit documentation to the
court and then supplement their
positions with 15-minute pres
entations. according to Ms.
Getzoff. who said it would then
be approximately six months
before a decision Is rendered.
" I f it comes to a court proceed
ing." she said, "the DER is
certainly prepared to defend Its
position."
Sanford's decision to institute
an appellate action may consider
events that transpire five days
before the DER secretary ts
expected to hand down her
riding. On Feb. 3. the city faces
defending Its Yankee Lake con
demnation suit Irom dismissal,
according to defense attorney
Mack Cleveland. A hearing in
Melbourne that day will address
the defendants' position that city
charters were violated when
Sanford commissioners met to
sanction the eminent domain
proceeding. Cleveland said.
W it h o u t th e 2 .8 6 7 - a c r e
Yankee Lake site, compliance
with the DER mandate to get out
of the lake will put Sanford In
the considerably more expensive
|M>sit!on of obtaining a number
uf smaller parcels fur effluent
d is p o s a l, a c c o r d in g to B ill
Simmons, city planning and
engineering director.
Compounding the problem Is
whether enough o f these sites
can be found, he said.

WASHINGTON (UPI) - Galileo

Galileo determined around 1604
that, excluding the effects of wind

Interest rate declines and expectations that the
Federal Reserve would lower its discount rate

impetuses seemed to vanish, disappointment set
in. first in the bond market and soon after in the

Treasury's sale of 84.75 billion or bonds due in
2006 also helped drive the bond market lower.

Reagan Looks To A llies For Aid
But They're Looking Elsewhere
WASHINGTON (UPI) - President Reagan, still lacking a
"smoking gun" to link Moammar Khadafy to terrorism, is
embarked on an escalated campaign against Libya
combining economic pain with the Implicit threat of
miliiary attack.
Delivering a one-two punch against Khadafy with
economic sanctions and freezing Libyan government
assets in ibis country. Reagan today looked to U.S. allies to
strengthen an economic boycott designed to punish Libya
for alleged sponsorship of terrorism.
The administration also held out the prospect of
additional unilateral action, to both increase pressure on
Khadaly and demonstrate to nervous allies that Reagan Is
determined to see his drive succeed with or without their
help.
In a further bid to marshal world opinion against
Khadafy. the State Department released a report alleging
Libyan Involvement In 58 previously known incidents of
terrorism between I979and 1985.
The Fill has been watching about half the 6.500 Libyan
nationals living in the United States, presumed to be
supporters of Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy.

he was not eligible for gain time.

earn some gain time because a
District Court ruled in Sep

serving m inim um -m andatory
sentence could get some "in

Mason was sentenced before the
decision, the offense the court
considered in a separate case
occurred before Mason's, thus
making him and other prisoners

earned was subslracted from his

Kutun and Hattaway were in Tallahassee
Tuesday and Tuesday night, preparing for
Wednesday's state-wide launch of their cam

Kutun resigned his scat in the Florida House
which he had held since 1972 effective December

from 1974 to 1980. He ran for the Senate In 1982
and was defeated by Incumbent Republican Toni
Jennings.
Hattaway Is the second lieutenant governor
hopeful from Seminole County. Representative
Bobby Brantley, a Longwood Republican, is
running for the state's number two spot with
Tampa Mayor Bob Martinez at the top of the
ticket. They are the only two announced
candidates for lieutenant governor.
Kutun said Hattaway would bring balance to
the viability of a ticket that would have state-wide
appeal. Kutun is from Miami and the south
Florida area, while Hattaway is familiar in the
central and north Florida areas.
"Because of the fast growth in the central
Florida area, there will always be a great Interest
in having leadership from central Florida." Kutun

Marcos Critics Fear Threat
Will Be Excuse To Cancel Election
MANILA. Philippines IUPII — Government critics today
said they feared a reported assassination attempt on
President Ferdinand Marcos's daughter could lead to a
n-impositlon of martial law and cancellation o f February's
election.
Opposition Member of Parliament Hotnobono Adaza said
the Incident was a "danger sign that the President is up to
some mischict again" as opposition Presidential candidate
Cora/on Aquino appeared headed toward a landslide
victory.
I bis is the beginning of a possible declaration of martial
law and the abortion of the election." Adaza said. "H e
(Marcos) sees the handwriting on the wall because of the
huge crowds Mrs Aquino Is drawing. Ills machine may not
be sutiicient to cope with the avalanche."
Civil Eights Attorney Rene Saguisag said Marcos could
be laying the groundwork to cancel the elections because of
"massive peace and order problems."
Marios declared martial law in 1972. citing conspiracies
Involving both the left and the right to topple him. Martial

KNOXVILLE. Tcnn. IUPII — A federal Judge who
sentenced Jake Butcher to 20 years in prison for bank
fraud denied the former banker’s request for a reduction of
the sentence despite a moving letter from Butcher.
“ I want to humbly beg for your help and understandm g." Butcher's letter said. "Hopefully you will be able to
see me and my family as we really are. As I write this letter
to you. my life Is one of confusion, hurt and guilt."
U.S. District Judge William K. Thomas said he believed it
was important that Butcher’s sentence remain at 20 years
to demonstrate to the public that white-collar crime docs
not pay.
"This court concludes that under all the circumstances,
the Imposition of the maximum sentence agreed to in the

The
Kutun-Hattaway ticket has well defined stands on
key Issues that are on Florida citizen's minds,
such as casino gambling, a state lottery, and
capital punishment.
O f casino gambling. Kutun said. "I'm against it
absolutely. I feel that it Is related to the criminal
element, and there is no place for it in the State of
Florida." Hattaway said. "Casino gambling would
take away from the family orientated atmosphere
of the state. W e’re not living in Nevada or New

They arc. however. In favor of a state lottery,
“ on the condition that the funds (collected) are
allocated for education. Its government con
trolled. non-lnfiltratcd by the criminal element,
and has overwhelming support across the state."
Kutun said. Hattaway echoed the comments.
On the issue of capital punishment. Kutun
says. "I'm In favor of It. and I'm the only
candidate that has voted for capital punishment."
Hattaway added. "I've always been in favor of
capital punishment for those who commit vicious
crimes, and I. and I think the people agree, that
those criminals should be made to pay.
Hattaway is a millionaire developer and

IN BRIEF
Senators Call For Moratorium
On M aster Teacher Program
TALLAHASSEE (UP!) — Commissioner of Education
Kalph Turlington and the chairmen of two key Senate
panels Wednesday called for a moratorium on the state's
master teacher program, branding It a failure In need of a
"major overhaul."
Education chairman Curtis Peterson. D-Lakcland. and
Appropriations subcommittee on education chulrwoman
Itelly Castor. D-Tampa. asked their committee members to
sign a letter asking Gov. Bob Graham to suspend the merit
pay system until It can be redesigned.
The letter urges Graham to stop testing whether teachers
qualify for master teacher status by Feb. I to allow
lawmakers to reevaluate the program In the spring.
Ruling Victory For Home Schools
TALLAHASSEE (UPI| — In a victory for "hom e schools",
an appeal court has cleared the way for four Starke. Fla.,
children to resume their educations at home free of a court
order that dclcared them truants and wards o f the state.
Hubert Edewaard. lawyer for the children's parents, said
the ruling ny the 1st District Court of Appeal stops short of
the wider opinion he sought on parents’ rights to leach
their children at home.
But Elaine Crawford, who with her husband Allen
challenged Bradford County Circuit Judge R.A. Green's
order, greeted the appeal-decision as a victory.
"More than any tin tig. what my husband started, he
thought was right.” she said in u telephone Interview. "W e
were being refused our right to be able to educate our
children as we se fit."
A three Judge panel of the appeal court based the
unanimous ruling on state laws allowing so-called "hom e
schools".

County To Nip Monster
Residents ot Ihe Ridgewood
Street nctghhoriiond are angered
over wlial they called a develop
er's proposal to huild singlefamily homes and turn them
Into boarding houses.
The citizens turned out at Ihe
county com m ission m eeting
Tuesday to voice their claims
tlial Developer Robert illeller Is
violating the county's zoning
regulations.
Illeller apparently told Ihe
residents and several county
officials of Iiis intention to bailil
fou r-b ed room sin gle fam ily
homes and then rent out the
rooms Individually.
The com m ission voted to
notify Illeller that he will 1m- in
violation of county codes If he
goes ahead with Ids plan, but
legally l be county cannot pre
vent the construction. Deputy
County Attorney Boh McMillan
said.
"W e need to advise (Hlellerl
that these are single-fam ily
homes and we intend for them to
be operated as such and If he
violates the code he will be
prosecuted." County Commis
sioner Samira Glenn said
The homes are In Glenn’s
district.
One of ihe area’s residents.
Max Fullerton, presented the
com m ission with a petition
signed by 60 citizens opposed to
Ihe proposed use of the homes.
Fullerton said two of the houses
on Ridgewood Street are under
construction, the county having
approved the building pcrmlls in
December.
He also said Illeller planned to
build several more, some 12
each year, to be used as rooming
houses. Fullerton said he un
derstood it was the developer's
intention to rent the house to
one person and und that others
living there would pay rent to
that person, who would then pay
the property owner.
"T h e Intent Is lo have a
multi-family dwelling." he said.
"T h is violates the intent of the
zoning regulations and Is an
attack on the entire counly. We
need lo nip this in the bud before
it turns Into the monster that Is
has the potential to be."
Fullerton also alleged lhat
Illeller violated a stop work
order Issued by the county late
last month.
Herb Hardin of (he county's
land management division satd
he lalkcd with Illeller prior to
the building permit being Issued
and told the developer the plan
was not permissible under the
county codes.
Hardin said he was "s u r
prised" when he found out the
permit had gone through and
that the county proceeded to
"red tag” the permit and Issue
the stop work order.
The work was able to con
tinue. Hardin said, after Illeller
modified the building plan to
eliminate four enclosed exterior
windows.
"(Hleller) has been put on
uni ice ami the (land manage
ment) department will monitor
the situation. If It becomes a
boarding house we will turn it
over lo the code enforcement
board." he said.
The county's hands may be
tied until a violation of the
county codes is actually com
mitted. that Is until the rooms
are rented, McMillan said.
He said Illeller eanuot legally
rent four different rooms to four
different people In a singlefamily home but that the county
cannot stop the construction at
this point.
"There is nothing the county
can do if the building meets the
requlrements for a single-family
home regardless of what he
plans in do with It." McMillan
said.
Area residents said they are
concerned about the amount of
truffle the m ulti-fam ily use
would generate and the Impact
septic tanks and drainage from
the residences would have on
their water wells.
Glenn told the residents Ihe
county "w ill do everything It
can" lo prevent Ihe homes from
being converted to multi-family
uses. She predicted the matter
may wind up before the county's
code enforcement or possibly in
court.

Fishermen who would like (o fish a
new spot with beautiful scenery and
big baaa will be glad to hear that the
Rodman Reservoir, which is Just north
of Salt Springs on State Road 19. has
been drawn down approximately five
feet In order to expose the kill hydrilla
growth. The drawdown will remain in
effect until the first of April.
Fishing can be red hot during a
drawdown because the entire fish
population Is forced into a much
smaller area. Fish tend to concentrate,
and anglers who locate these con
centrations of fish can experience fast
and furious act Ion.
Speckled perch action at Rodman Is
good, with many of the specks being
caught In the old Oklawaha River
channel. Anglers either fish with
Missouri minnows or Jug the hyacinth
patches. Old timers carry rakes with
them to clear out holes In the
hyacinths. It is easy to spot where the
speckled perch are biting due to the
number of boats in certain areas.

Bears' 46
Puzzles
Offenses
CHICAGO (UPI) - Teams In
the N FL this season have tried
various ways, most of which
were unsuccessful, to match up
against the C h icago Bears'
romplex *46’ defensive scheme.
The Miami Dolphins solved it
by throwing the ball on nearly
every down and came awav with
the lone victory over Ch'cago
this season.
The Los Angeles Rams, the
Bears' NFC championship oppo
nent Sunday at Soldier Field,
ranked 28th In passing this year.
Translation: the Ranis wouldn't
appear to have much of a chance
scoring against the league's No.
1 defense.
H o w ev e r, the Rams have
beaten the Bears and the '46' in
the past two years thanks to an
offensive line most consider
football's best. If the Rams can
match their running success
they have en joyed all year
against the Bears Sunday. Los
Angeles may have the ticket for
New Orleans and Super Bowl
XX.
LA's four interior linemen are
Pro Bowlers, counting injured
center Doug Sm ith. Guards
Dennis Hurrah and Kent Hill and
tackle Jackie Slater are the
others who provide the holes for
Eric Dickerson to pierce opj>onenis' defenses.
D ickerson , a fte r an early
season holdout, rushed for 1.234
yards in 292 carries.
"But he gets stronger as he
runs tlit* ball more and Inshowed that during the season."
said Bears linebacker Mike
Singletary.
The Rams have 2.057 yards
rushing and their ability to
maintain the flow of the game on
offense has been the key to their
first 12 wins this year.
The Bears' defensive line has
been the best at rushing the
quarterback the past two years
but has had som e trou ble
again st a b ig g e r back like
Dickerson.
That puls more pressure on
l he linebackers, namely
Sin gletary. Otis Wilson and
Wilbur Marshall.
Because Chicago has jumped
lo such big leads early, most
run-oriented teams have been
forced to go to the pass earlier
than expected.
Chicago has given up 1.319
vards rushing and 82.4 yards
per game, some 40 yards per
game below the Rams' offensive
average The Bears have allowed
176 yards passing. 23 fewer
than the LA offense, but a lot ol
those yards have come in the
second half when teams have
tried to mount com eb a ck s
through the air.
If Los Angeles has a successful
ground attack early, which has
been the key to the Rains'
success because they have
passed 100 fewer times than
they have run this year, it may
spell upset.
II they are forced to throw
against a Chicago defense lhai
has 64 sacks and has a 6-fool -5
defensive end In Richard Dent
(34 sacks In last two years). Los
Angeles will be in for a long
afternoon.
Dieter Brock and the Rams'
passing attack has averaged Just
153 yards passing and is last in
the NFL. Additionally, the Hears
have given up a scant 71 points
in the second half In 16 regular
season games, proving their in
vincibility once they have a lead.
"W e smell blood once we get
ahead," Singletary said. "1 kind
of feel sorry for them If a team
gets behind."
Because of the pressure the
Bears' defense applies. Chicago
has com e up with 34 Intercep
tions.
heard about Rodman Reservoir and
the huge trass that lurk under thr
stumps and hyacinth patches. The
current drawdown offers b a s s f i s h
ermen an opportunity to catch num
bers of large ilsh.
Wild shiners are undoubtedly the
most effective bait for bass at Rodman
Reservoir. Many large bass are caught
by anglers "free lining" shiners under
hyacl.dh patches. The shiners are
hooked by the anal fin and pitehed
gently to the edge of the hyacinths.
Reels arc kept on free spool, and the
shiners arc allowed to swim under the
floating vegetation. Many times the
bass will be on the edge of the cover,
while at other times strikes will come
10 to 20 feet under the vegetation.
Other bass fishermen have a great
deal of success trolling shiners behind
their boats with the use of a trolling
motor. The banks of the Cross Ftortda
Barge Canal arc a good spot to troll
shiners. Some anglers troll with a cork,
and others simply use a large wcedlcss
hook.
While shiner fishing, heavy tackle
must be used at Rodman due to the
thick cover. Ii is impractical lo use
anything lighter than 25-lcst line in
order lo wrestle a big bass not ol its
weedy lair.
Bass fishermen who prefer arl IItrials
will enjoy tossing splimerbaits and
plastic worms in the stump fields on
either side of tin’ Cross Florida Barge
Canal. The jug and pig is also deadly al
Rodman.
Rodman Reservoir is approximately
a two-hour drive, but it Is well worth It
for anglers who want a change of
scenery and an opportunity to get their
line stretched hv a looker bass.
Launching facilities are available at
Orange Springs. Florida on Slate Road
315. or at Kenwood Landing, also on
State Road 315. Fishermen are advised
to use the ramp at Kenwood, as the
main channel Is blocked by hyacinths
just above the ramp at Orange Springs.
Wild shiners may lx- purehased at
Orange Springs and the prlee will
range from 96 lo 87 per dozen. Anglers
should purchase at least two or three
dozen shiners for a day’s fishing.
HUB
JIM'S TIP — Mere are lour lures or
baits are very effective for cold-water
trass: Jigging spoons, splnnerhalts. the
jig and pig. and live halt. Jigging
spoons are deadly when bass are In
deep water, while splnnerhalts eateh
many fish If the bass are hurled In
weeds. The Jig and ptg is good in heavy
cover, and live shiners are best In
extremely eold water.

West Orange not shooting much

know darned well they can
afford It.

PASADENA. Calif. |UPI) Voyager 2 presumably raced
past three big moons and then
dived toward the frozen fringes
of the planet Uranus Saturday In
the first close-up exploration of
the bizarre Uranian kingdom l.H
billion miles from Earth.
Because the nuclear-powered
spacecraft Is so far from home,
anxious scientists had to wall
two hours and -15 minutes for
the probe's confirming radio
signals traveling at the speed of
light to reach ground antennas.
Hut project manager Richard
Laesc r said all Indications were
that mankind's first exploration
of the seventh planet from the
sun was going as plunncd.
Voyager 2 reported at 6:55 a.m.
I*ST that It hail received the final
scries of instructions for the
historic close encounter.
"That means the spacecraft Is
thoroughly programmed and
ready and able to perform Its
duties." he said. "We're Just
sitting here waiting for the data
to come down."
By H:20 a.m.. the 1,819-pound
NASA television probe presum

moons T itanla. Oberon and
A riel. The probe was pro
grammed lo lly within 79.000
miles ol Ariel and more than
200.000 miles away from the
other two satellites.
Voyager 2 was traveling at
better than 35.000 mph at the
time, rapidly accelerating under
the pull of Uranus' gravity.
After whipping within 51.000
miles of the Uranian cloud tops.

of the large Uranian moons, as
well as the planet and Its dark
rings of frozen debris.
In less than half a day.
Voyager 2 was expected to
obtain more Information about
Uranus than all that has been
learned since It was discovered
by an amateur astronomer In
England 205 years ago.
"We've been walling 4W years

Munoz.
The Judge postponed arraignment until Monday and
allowed Fiedler and Clarke, who both face up to three years
In Jail If convicted, to remain free without posting bail.
The Los Angeles Times, meanwhile, reported Saturday
that the felony Indictment was based In part on a
conversation secretly recorded by the campaign manager
of Fiedler's GOP rival, stale Sen. Ed Dav is, during a visit to
Fiedler's home.
A total of nine Republicans are vying for the right to
challenge Sen. Alan Cranston, a liberal Democrat, next
November. Fiedler and Davis, both conservatives from the
San Fernando Valley, are fighting for the same block of
primary votes.
The newspaper, quoting sources, said Davis’ campaign
manager. Martha 7A\m. was wired for sound during a Jan.

Scientists Rescue Comet Probe

PASADENA, Calif. (UP11 — Worried scientists were able
to solve a communications glitch with a pioneering
European probe sailing toward a close encounter with
Halley's comet thanks to an assist from the U S. space
agency.
Radio signals from the European Space Agency's Giotto
comet craft suddenly weakened Friday, prompting a call to
NASA for use of a large tracking antenna in California.
The request came just a few hours before NASA's
Voyager 2 probe made its historic close encounter with
mysterious Uranus.
Voyager projcii manager Richanl Laesei said one
tracking and communications antenna used lor the
Voyager mission was turned over to ESA early Friday and
a second, larger dish in Gnldstone. Calif., also was placed at
ESA's disposal to help pick up the weak signals Irom Giotto
and help pin down the problem.
An ESA spokeswoman said later the trouble was the
result of a mis-aimed antenna on the spacecraft and that
ESA scientists had developed a maneuver to correct the
aiming problem.

Paldela Proposal, and An Open
Letter letter to America are a few
of the better known reports, but
there have been others. General
ly I think that the tremendous
attention and review of educa
tion has been a good thing. I
have often said that there Is no
more Important task than the
education of our youth. The
enormous Interest In studying
that process and the large au
dience which met each of the
reports would suggest that edu
cation and the transmitting of
our cu ltu re and A m erican
heritage to your young people Is
viewed almost universally as a
vital subject.
A review of the reports men
tioned above and several others
Indicates that there arc many
areas of agreement, grouped
under two headings: curriculum
and standards, and teaching.
In the area of curriculum
standards, twenty-three separate
proposals are suggested, ranging
from revising the school curricu
lum to incorporating more out
side learning oppotunitlics.
Nearly all the reports agreed that
there should be increased acad c m i c r e q u i r e m e n t s In

Almost as many reports re

stress the need for Increases In
ucadcmic requirements Tor art
und music, and foreign lan
guage. An equal amount re
commend raising college ad
mission standards. A majority of
the reports also recommend re
visions In vocational education
courses.
In terms of how subjects arc
taught, a majority of the reports
find that we need to emphasize
reasoning skills In instruction,
not Just memorization. I was
pleased to see that a majority of
the reports also stress the rec
ommendation that we need to
expect more from our students.
One thing that experience in
Florida has shown Is that as we
have expected more of our
s t u d e n t s , t h e ir le v e ls o f
achievement have risen. An
equal number of reports have
also stressed the need to provide
special help for slow learning
students, and it is important that
we ure educating our students In
an effort to help each of them
fulfill their potential by achiev
ing the most that they can.
Other recommendations In the
area of curriculum revision and
standards Include Increasing
discipline, a recommendation
made In approximately half of
the education reports, testing for
promotion or graduation, and
eliminating student tracking.
Setting a basic, "core" curricu
lum and providing additional
help for gifted and talented
students were also among the
recommendations of about half
of the reports on national educa
tion.
Those Initiatives which were
recommended in only a very few
of the major educational reports
include beginning education for
students at an earlier age. in
corporating outside learning
opportunities, upgrading tex
tbooks and assigning more
homework. While the latter two
recommendations were made In
both A Nation Al Risk and
Action for Excellence, neither
were roundly recommended In
the majorlt v of studies.

UCF Excels In'CLAST Test
Sophomores at The University
of Central Ftorlda had the sec
ond highest passing percentage
for the College Level Academic
Skills test. CLAST, of all nine
state universities In Florida.
At UCF 91 percent passed the
test, while the only state school
with a higher figure was the
University of Florida with 94
percent. As for the private
schools . Stetson led all with 97
percent.
T h e C L A S T Is a c o m
prehensive exam that all stu
dents must pass In order to
recleve an AA degree. Sopho
mores usautly take the test when
they accumulate 55 college cred
it hours.
The Board of Regents met this
past week and discussed many
issues, one which would In
crease the student activity and
service fee. This fee Increase
would go toward the construc
tion of a new Student Unton.
Earlier this year the student
senate voted for the Increase of
the fee and has since presented
It to the BOR for their approval.
Since most students travel to
UCF, traffic and road situation is
of great concern to most stu
dents. faculty and staff. The
average amount of time which a
student spends traveling to
school Is thirty minutes. There
have been great strides to Im
prove the condition of such
roads as Alafaya Trail, and
University Blvd. which runs Into
the university from Semoran.
Currently, the completion of
one of a four step process to
several bids for the project, the
lowest being §4 million. The bad
news is that the road will be
difficult to travel during the 15
months of construction.

negotiators for the airline and Its 4.458

Washington under the auspices ol a federal
mediator.
Eastern asked the mediator to release it
from negotiations to trigger a 30-day cooling
off period.
Officials of Eastern's three major unions,
meanwhile, denied responsibility for an
evesdropping bug found hidden in the
ceiling of lhe airline president's office.
The bug. which Cosley said was being
investigated by the FBI. was "alive and
functlonable" when it was found last week
hidden lit the ninth floor office of Eastern
President Joseph Leonard.
Leonard, who moved into the officii;!
formerly occupied bv chairman Frank
Borman in October, did not know how long
the bug had been there. Cosley said.

IN BRIEF
Mandela Honored For Leadership
O f South Africa's Blacks
JOHANNESBURG. South Africa (UPII - Black dissident
Winnie Mandela, wife of Jailed African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela, accused the Reagan administration
of favoring Angolan rebels with aid ahead of the ANC.
Mandela made the accusation Friday when she was
presented with the Robert F. Kennedy human rights award
bv former Rep. John Buchanan. D-Ala.. who said It was "in
gratitude ... lor her leadership of the black people ol South
Africa."
The award included a 12-Inch bron/e host of Kennedy,
who visited South Africa In 1960. and an unspecified
amount of money.
Mandela said the United States promised "aid to the
bandit (Jonas) Savlmbl (president of the Angolan guerrilla
group UNITA), who brings death and destruction to the
people of Angola ... (while it) refuses cries for help from the
true representatives of this country, the ANC."
Watergate-Type Scandal Hits U.K,
...S huttle
LONDON (UPII — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
fought to limit the political damage Friday from a crisis
that led to the resignations of two cabinet ministers and
was likened by a newspaper to the U.S. Watergate affair.
Thatcher's immediate problem was to appoint a
replacement for Leon Brit tan. who resigned as trade
minister Friday In a controversy about a leaked letter over
the bailout of the Westland helicopter company.
Unless she appoints a replacement over the weekend, she
will stand alone In Parliament Monday to defend her
government in the most |iolitically dangerous debate in the
House of Commons since she gained power in 1979.

Predictions
New Moon Over Chicago Or Has Fridge's Warranty Run Out?
By Chock Burgess
Special to th e Herald
With the Super Bowl a little over 24 hours
awuv. Just about everyone nnd his brother has
an opinion on the outcome. However, not so
many are willing to give the score and stick with
It.
There are some coaches In the area, though,
that have gone with either the Chicago Bears or
the New England Patriots and are willing to bet
their houses on It.
The clash will be the battle between the
Monsters of the Midway and the Patriots of
Foxboro. Mass. The 46 defense against the
backfleld which possesses the explosive running
of C raig Ja m e s , T he B e a rs have been
established as a 10-potnt favorite.
Not only are the coaches different, but they
are the same. Both Mike Dltka and Raymond
Berry coached under the Balias Cowboys' Torn
Landry. However, their style of play as head
Super Bowl
coaches differs as much as the Civil War’s North
and South.
Their team attitudes are definitely evident.
Chicago has the style that has captured the
hearts of all Americans — except a few In the
Boston area. They huve William "The Rcfrlderator" Perry, the Super Bowl Shuffle, a
rebellious quarterback from BYU that Is now
taking acupuncture treatments from a man
named Hiroshi Shlralshl and a group of women
who are 200 pounds and heavier that call
themselves the Refrlgerettes.
The Patriots counter with a new Super Bowl
song boasting of "beating the Bears or the NFC",
a Samoan running back named Mosl Talupu. a
white running bark who provided 1,587 total
yards of offense lor the Pats and a slogan that
goes "th e warranty has run out on the
refrigerator."
In the midst of all of the Super Bowl hype and
despite the huge underdog role the Patriots are
facing, several local athletic coaches weren't*
afraid to predict a New England victory. Then
again, a lot liked the Bears' defense, too.
"I think It's going to lie Chicago 17. New
England 10.” Seminole High head football
mentor Dave Mosurc predicted. "It's plain and
simple. It all comes down to superior defense."
This may lx- a partial choice for Mosurc. Not
only was he the defensive coordinator for the
Semlnolcs for many years before becoming the
head coach, but he has a player on the Bears
that he used to coach.
Dennis McKinnon, the Bears standout wide
receiver, played three years for "Mr. Intensity"
at South Miami.
Mosure picking the Bears to win the Super
Bowl Is like the late George "Poppa Bear" Halas
picking them. Personal ties and defensive
prowess are the rational Incentive for the
forecast.
Moving to a different roach and a different
sport. It appears that a different approach to the
final outcome is more suitable.
"New England 24. Bears 17." Lake Howell
soccer coach Norm Wight said. "I like their style
of play after the Miami game. They showed a
more balanced side to their team. I know they're
the underdog, but the Bears are a hit on the
rocky side and I feel they're too overrated."
And what about the 10-point spread?
"I like the Patriots." Wight confessed. "1 like
(quarterback Tony) Eason. He's more calm and
mature than McMahon. He knows his limita
tions."
So far It has been a quest for personal

Think Tw ice Before Picking O v e r Pats
NEW ORLEANS IUIM) - For all you
out there married to the Idea the only
sure things In life are death, taxes and
the Chicago Bears this Sunday, think
twice.
That’s what I've done. Obviously
that’s what some others are also doing
about picking a winner In Super Bowl
XX because the New England Patriots
who were 10 Wpoint underdogs all
week long have now gone down to 10
points. Which Isn't saying you still
can't find plenty of Chicago money
around.
A few davs ago. you could get 10-1
on William' "The Refrigerator" Perry
scoring another touchdown for the
Bears. Now the Barbarv Coast In Las
Vegas reports that price has tumbled
to H I. A lot of people though are
taking another look at the Patriots.
Among them Is Sonny Jorgensen,
one of the NFL's premier quarterbacks
with the Philadelphia Eagles and
Washington Redskins for 14 years. He
likes the Bears but he’s careful to
include his little hedge bv saying don't
sell the Patriots short, they could
.surprise.
Ronald Reagan must be having some
second thoughts about the Dears also.
He went to school In Illinois and
recreated the Chicago Cubs' games for
a Des Moines. Iowa, radio station in his
early days as a sportscaster. so you
know where his heart lies.
But he isn’t taking any chances. He
wanted to know more about players
like Tony Eason. Craig Jam es and
John Hannah as well as Patriots coach
Raymond Berry.
And to make sure he did. he had his
press secretary. Larry Speakes. call
New England's publicity director Jim
Greenidge for additional Information
on them. He went to the right place.
Greenrtdgc knows more about the
Patriots than their own mothers.
My first thought on Sunday's ball
game was that the Bears arc the best
team in football, certa in ly well
balanced offensively and defensively,
they're handled capably by Mike
Dltka. and no one around can beat
them.
That was my initial impression and I
still think they're an exceptional team.
Possibly even as good as those 1980
Pittsburgh Stcclers who became the
first team ever to win four Super Bowl
titles by beating the Los Angeles Rams
31-19 six years ago.
The Bears have such a good team
that I think the only two things that
can possibly beat them Is overcon
fidence or ovcrachlevemenl by the
Patriots. The Bears don’t strike me as
being overconfident but from what I've
seen of the Patriots, they unques
tionably are overachievers.
Enough to make me believe they'll
find some way to beat the Bears
Sunday. Yup. even without the points.
I must add this warning, though. 1
haven’t made a mistake in the last 30
seconds.
My feeling Is anytime anything Is loti
T V : W C S H -2 a t 5 :1 5 p . m .
sure, something generally happens to
make It come out entirely the other
way. I’ve seen that happen so many
times, haven’t you? It's like Murphy’s
Law. Somewhere along the line some
thing is guaranteed to go wrong.
Something very nearly did for the
Bears Thursday. This was before
everyone who had anything to do with
reporting what Jim McMahon was
supposed to have said, that "all
women in New Orleans are sluts,"
issued a retraction saying there was
"n o basis to believe" the Bears’
quarterback ever made such a state
ment.
McMahon, himself, denied ever say
ing It. With his reputation for saying
some of the things he has in the past,
however, there were many who
believed he actually said what had
been reported.
They remembered he also originally
denied mooning a passing helicopter
the other day until a UPI photo plainly
showed him doing so. McMahon, who
has been bothered by a pain In his
backside, had no other choice but to
admit he had pulled down his pants at
the overhead chopper.
"I just wanted to show them where It
hurl." he said.
It would’ve hurt both him and the
Bears much more had there been no
retraction by a local TV station of the
statem ent attributed to McMahon
about the women of New Orleans.
Gelling a whole football team mad at
you Is one thing. Getting a whole city
of females up In arms against you Is
quite another. Good as he Is. McMahon
would've been impossibly overmat
ched.
And as good as the Bears are us a
team, they still have some weaknesses.
Leave it to a guy like Raymond Berry
to find them and exploit them. He's a
nil-picker when It comes to that. In all
my life. I've never run Into a morr
liiirlguing football coach. Or maybe a
better one.
He's no revivalist, reformist or medi
cine man. he isn't anything like that,
yet lie has been able to convince the
Patriots they can win. He has them
believing. In themselves and in their
ability. And If you're wondering how
that can possibly Influence the out
come of any conflict, go ask Tug
McGraw sometime.
All logic says the Bears should win.
but all Super Bowl games In the past
have not wound up the way you'd
think they would logically. In that
connection, most people automatically
go back to Super Bowl III when the
prohibitively favored Colts were upset
by the Jets. There's a tendency to
forget that one year later the Vikings
were two touchdown favorites and still
were bowled over 23*7 by the Chiefs.
Ja y Hilgenberg's Aunt Mary poin
tedly reminded him of that contest
when the Bears center called her from
here earlier In the week. She has good
reason to remember the game well
because her husband. Wally, played in
It for the Vikings.
Jurgcnsen. now a Washington TV
sportscaster. looks at Sunday's game
this way:
"If It was me going against the
Bears. I’d figure they're supposed to
kick my butt. I like that. What have I
got to lose? They still have to do It.
don't they?"
You got It. Sonny. If the Bears do it
Sunday, there'll be no further question
about their_ superiority.
But 1 like the way the Patriots have
been playing in their last three games,
the way they’ve taken care of first the
Jets, then the Haiders and then the
Dolphins, all on the road.
Don Shu la says they’ll have to play
the same way to beat the Bears and
I'm not altogether sure whether It’s
Raymond Berry. John Hannah or
Andre Tippett, hut something makes
me believe they will.

Kruczck's clutch putt gave him a second-day total of 65 for the par-72 course and
a two-day total of 131. Hallctt. who had

Chance O f Catching Florida Junior Slowly Fades A w a y
By Sam Cook
Herald Sport* Editor
As Florida Junior College slowly pulls
away In the M id-Florida C onference
basketball race. Seminole Community Col
lege's Raiders and Daytona Beach Commu
nity College's Scots concentrate on the next
best thing — second place.
"I told (Daytona coach Ray) Ridenour
before the season we're both playing for
second place." SCC coach BUI Payne said.
"We better worry about the rest of the
teams. FJC Is gone."
Florida Junior sports a 6*0 record while
SCC and Daytona Beach are both second at
4-2. Although there Is still an outside There
Is still an outside chance that one can catch
the high-flying stars hut the hope Is
dwindling.
Second place, nevertheless, pays the same
as first if you're fortunate enough to win the
Mid-Florida Conference Post-season Quali
fying T ou rn am en t. Both Payne and
Ridenour would be happy with second and
the host's role for tournament. The winner
of that tournament also qualifies for the
state tournament — a berth In the elite eight
at DcLand's Stetson University at the end of
February.
Payne said It wasn't impossible for either
the Raiders or the Scots to catch the Slars
but it was Improbable. "Somebody Is going
to have to beat them besides us." Payne

Continued from IB
satisfaction that has determined the Super Bowl
premonitions. Punting the hall hack over from
the soccer field to the football field, one may gel
a foresight from a pigskin expert.
"Chicago 24. New England 14." Oviedo
football coach Ja ck Blanton said. "They've
(Chicago) got a good defense and they're playing
as a team. Ju st their altitude makes them a
great team. It'll he hard for anyone to bet
against them."
Blanton's prediction Is not actually as straight
forward as It looks. He. too. follows the pattern
of personal desires.
"1 hate New England now after they beat
Miami." Blanton said. "I guess I've got to go
with the Bears now that Miami's silting at
home."
Like most Dolphin fans. Blanton I s going
against the Patriots because ot something they
did. They only broke a 18-game losing streak lit
the Orange Bowl when It counted the most.
One loyal Dolphin fan who takes a more
conservative point of view is Ken Brauman.
Brauman. who has coached a Seminole High
track team for the past two years and brought It
a state championship last year, went with the
Patriots.
Not because they beat the Dolphins or they're
better, but because he really doesn't care about
the game. "After the Dolphins lost. I lost all
interest In the Super Bowl." Brauman. who
predicted 24-17 Patriot victory, said "They
(Patriots! have more offense than the Bears I
think Jim McMahon is going to him* up
Brauman didn't realize ex.n th how much the
Bears were favored by. but didn't lei a little
underdog label affect his decision
"T h a t's what (Muhammedl Ah was |au
underdog) when he fought Sonny Liston the l i r s i
time." Brauman said. "Being lavored doesn't
mean a thing They're all p r o f e s s i o n a l s and
they're all good ball players '
Another coach who thinks he has a winner i s
Lake Mary wrestling mentor Doug Peters, who i s
even having a Super Bowl party to welcome the
N’FL's new world champs.
"I've got to go with the Bears and I think the
score is going to be 24*7." Peters said, "They're
strategy and it worked."
The spark to the llame ot the
Lions' 37-16 run was the outside
shooting of forward Unroe. I n
roe hit the lirst bucket of ihe
third period off ol a steal from
the Hornets' David McDaniel lo
[iiit l tie Lions up. 25-22
However, with only 27 sec
onds showing on the scoreboard.

The importance of consistently
encouraging children cannot be
overemphasized. Whether at
learning to talk, performing
household chores, or being n
walk-on angel in the school play,
children who are fortified with
confidence will gain skills and
self-esteem. We must instill
courage by giving earned praise,
by urging attempts at new tasks,
and bv promoting independa n e e . T h e s p ir it of e n
couragement should guide us
through all the dally problems
and situations of hildhood.

Parents must have the courage
to realize their m istakes in
rearing children; otherwise, suc

be made. Some of the customary
methods that we use- in tending
our children are clearly er
roneous and must be addressed
if we expect our young ones to
grow up emotionally healthy.

Concert Designed
To Make Classical
Guitar More Fun
Stan Bumgarner, guitarist,
will appear at Jan . 29. at H p.m..
in the Concert Hall of the Fine
Arts Building. Seminole Com
munity College, in a concert
designed to make classical guitar
more fun.
"I suspect that when many
people see ’classical guitar."’
Bumgarner says, "they yawn
and think not my kind of
music.'"
Bumgarner’s concert proves it
isn't necessarily so. In the first
part of his unique program. Stun
dresses casually, shares personal
a n e c d o t e s a it d . u s in g a
s o p h i s t i c a t e <1 2 projector/dlssolvc system, shows
slides that complement some of
the music lie plays.
"I want people to relax and get
to know me during this part of
my concert." says Bumgarner,
with a twinkle ol Ills eye. "In
addition to enjoying the music,
of course.”
At Intermission he changes to
th« Waklvo Rlvtr wh«r«
a tuxedo for the second half
which follows a more traditional
format. "People enjoy the vari
ety in this concert. They tell me
it’s more interesting than formal
recitals they've attended." re
lates the performer.
Stan knows about variety. A
native of North Carolina, be grew
up listening to country music
and played rock and roll pro
fessionally until he discovered
classical guitar at age twentytwo.
"I got tired of rock music. And
I wanted to play the guitar in a
way that didn’t need singing or
accompaniment by other in
struments. Classical gutter, was
It for me!"
Bumgarner received a degree
in M usic {e d u ca tio n from
I.cnolr-Bhyne College. Hickory,
N.C.. and studied guitar with
Jesus Silva, protege of Andres
Segovia and instructor at the
North Carolina School of the
Arts.

‘Katie's Landing'
Her Claim To Fame Is Her Name
By S atan Lodtn
Herald S taff W riter
It's not unusual for a person
to lend their name lo their
business, but Katie Monerlef ts
a bit unique because when she
named her Wckiva River-side
resort "Katies Landing." she
switched from a lifetime of
being called K athleen to
become Katie.
And now. she said, campers
and daytrippers on her canoe
runs sometimes even ask for
her autograph, although her
only claim to fame is that she
carries the name of the land
ing she operates and owns,
along with husband Russell, a
dean at Seminole Community
College.
When asked for her auto
graph. Mrs. Monerlef always
says. "You're kidding." Peo
ple. she said, "are delighted lo
know there’s a real Katie.
They really don’t expect to see
a Katie. They’re so shocked
that I here's an honest-togoodness Katie who’s always
here, from 7 a.m. to 7 a.m.,
earlier if necessary, she said.
Although her work and
pleasure mix. Mrs. Monerlef
nevet tires of the water. She
grew up on the shores of a lake
In Washington state, paddled
a canoe to her first Job. and
now lives along the Little
Weklva River, where she
supervises her landing on the

State Road 46.
As an avid canoeist and
nature lover who is on the
board of the Friends of the
Weklva. the Audubon Society,
a member of the Sierra Club
and the Florida Trail Associa
tion. as well as a grandmother.
Mrs. Monerlef travels the
Weklva in a canoe about twice
a week and has plans for a two
week canoe excursion.
Mrs. Monerlef. who became
"Katie" about I I years ago.
said that newcomers seem to
take to the river more than the
oldttmcrs. "T he new people
know more about u t h a n
people who’ve lived here 20
years," she said.
"They come looking for
things to do, and find them.
The Floridians know about the
Weklva. but they’ve never
been on It. They take It for
granted.
"Probably most have heard
about the squatters and the
(Florida state cabinet's) recent
decision ordering long-time
squatters on the river’s islands
to tear down their cabins.
People know about the squat
ters. or If there’s something

Weklva. but they've been out
on it. They don't know what
the Weklva Is. They don’t
know how long U Is. and It
runs through everybody's
backyard." Mrs. Monerlef said.
As for the squatters. Mrs.
Monerlef said, "I know I pay
an awful lot of taxes both on
the Little Weklva and here and
I'm so .regulated you cannot
believe it. both In the business
and our personal home. I do
know that those people are not

Mrs. Monerlef said it Isn't easy

now. The odds are dollars to
doughnuts that West was lead
ing from the heart queen. And
so. when East goes up with the
ace. South should unload his
king. Now the J-1 0 of hearts will
provide th e extra entry to
dummy that Is needed whenever
East has the king of clubs
guarded three times. It's a play
that's easy to understand but
easy lo overlook. Repent, ye
sinners! Before you play to trick
one. give careful thought to your
action and its consequences.

'Conversions' Reported Every Day In County Courtrooms; Rarely Believed
Harold Staff W riter
It hough Jallhousc religious pro*
ms are praised by officials, it seems
jurt tales of religious conversion
seen by Judges, attorneys, lawmen
’ Juries for what they apparently arc
many cases — hypocritical ploys.
Defendants often tell stories of "havfound God” in hopes of a lighter
ilence.
The defendant who wears his "reion" on his sleeve in court is looked
with a Jaundiced eye by experienced
rcutors and Judges, according to
s s l s t a n t S t a t e A tto r n e y Don
irblestonc. He said It's tough to
enerallze. but even If n proported
tllglous conversion prior to a court
jpearance Is valid and believable a
cfendant shouldn't hope for it to have
Igreat Impact on his or her situation.
It's something seen everyday In
cmlnole County courtrooms, with Lt.
lobert Kunkler who supervises court*
JU S C security, saying
a lot more
;l_ftlblcs come Into the courthouse than
out. Before much of the sentencing
ras shifted from the downtown courtjuse to the branch at the Seminole
?ounty Jail. Kunkler said about once a
reek he would find a Bible left behind
a holding cell. Left by a defendant
. /ho abandoned fnlth once his or her
jiMcase was resolved.
I W Kunkler praised the Good News
. Mission Jail and Prison Ministries.
' : which with with volunteers from area
churches and Individuals brings re*
llglous services and counseling Into the
' Seminole County Jail.
"I feel very strongly about that. I feel
1It is necessary and helps a lot of
people." Kunkjer said in his courtroom
work, however, he has seen many
<i "Jallhousc or courtroom converts who
found Jesu s in Jail and left him behind
>'at the first bar after they got nut."
'
He has also seen many phonics who
•; claimed to be converts In the hope that
they might save their own skins.
Many people, because of a lack of
activity, turn to religion In Jail. Kunkler
said. "I look at these people and hope
It’s for real.” Kunkler said. "I do hope
they have been converted. It seems
Ironic that a criminal goes to Jail and
becomes converted. If a person is
sincere this Is a personal thtng. It
brings a lot of relief to some people in
Jail."
A tto rn e y L eo n B . C h e e k III,
Casselberry, said the Bible, which Is
used to administer oaths in the court*
'There ar# no atheists

room, has a place not only at the
Judge's bench, but in the hands of
defendants and their families. If they
draw solace from having It.
Cheek said he has never discussed
with a client the udvisibllity fur or
against bringing a Bible to court.
However, he said, a religious con
version might show that a person had
something positive in their lives.
"I'm not sure prisons are any dif
ferent from anywhere else where there
are missionaries." he said. However,
when it comes to religion exerting an
influence on the outcome of a case.
Cheek said. "I'm not sure society or
government has any business in get
ting Into what a person's religious
beliefs are. It's a very personal tiling.
There are many different religious
beliefs. Some call for a Bible to be
carried everywhere."
Marblcstone said, generally when he
secs a Bible on the defense table. "I
think they arc trying to impress the
court and others."
There are three classes of courtroom
Bible bearers Marbleslonc said: "Those
who ure trying to pull the wool over the
eyes of the system: those who have had
a true religious conversion and those
who are trying to do som ething
b e c a u s e of th e sorry stale of their
lives."
" E v e r y c a s e is d i f f e r e n t , "
Marblcstone said, "but by and large
there's not much to it. You see a great
deal of It on death row. The Black
Widow Ircferlng the recent Orange
County woman accused of killing her
husband and who had already been
convicted of murdering her son. who
professed having been "born again") —
murderers, the people who rape rob
and murder should be the last believed.
Not only what they say in court, but
everything they say.”
"There no atheists in foxholes." he
said. "Once they’re back home In the
tavern they're atheists again. They get
religion and use It to th**lr advantage,
either consciously jr unconsciously.
When they get out it's the moment of
truth. They go back to their old ways."
Seminole County Sheriffs Chief Dep
uty Duane Harrell, a church-goer and
strong supporter of in-Jail religious
programs, said. "If 1 were a Judge I
think 1 would go on the merits of the
crime In considering what sentence I
was going to give. Then, whcrcevcr
they went from there I would let a
parole board consider their actions.
You're going to reap what you sew.
Time tells In Jail or out."
Circuit Judge Dominick J . Salfi,
reflecting on when he heard criminal
cases, said in about 20 to 30 percent of
the cases the defendants would bring a
Bible to court. He said that In consid
ering sentencing, if a defendant,
whether they professed a religious
conversion or not. if they presented to
him a plan to show that they sincerely
wanted to "clean up the mess they had
made of their lives.” that would
possibly impact on his decision in their
case.
Salfi sees some Jallhousc conversions
as sincere, but said that some inmates
who And God In Jail will tell a Judge
they rcaljze that to pay the debt for
their past deeds, they need to go to
prison and then be on parole.
"I believe a person ought to have the
opportunity to change and to clean up
their lives. We need to look at how they
propose to do that. If they are sincere,
or If they are trying to get by without
taking responsibility." Salfi said.
It's up to Judges and parole boards to
make Judgment calls on changes of
behavior, he said. "There are no cold
and fast rules against being born again.
We can live with real change. But. Just
because you say this — a Judge
accepting it is a big difference.” Salfi
said.
Seminole County sheriffs Sgt, Jack
Cash, who was recently ordained as a
member of. the Episcopal clergy, said.
"Everybody when they're going to
court says. 'Give me civilian clothes
and a Bible.'
"It's a scam for some ol them, but for
some It's not. There are people who are
legitimately turned around. They'll say
they were in prison for a purpose a
positive purpose, not a negative one of
being warehoused.
"They say. 'I was too busy on the
streets to listen to what was being said
to me. It took the shock of prison to
make me aware of whut's going on.'
"There are debts we all have to pay."
Cash said. "They may have to pay a
debt back to man. but you're talking
about a different thing — m an's
forgiveness and God's forgiveness.
"The model we're suppose to look lor
Is Christ. The only thing I've got there
is to turn the other cheek. I'm not
saying these people should be able to
say. 'I've got religion. I should be
released.* That may not be the best
thing for them.
"Even the person who has truly had
an honest conversion, they many need
time. You can't help everyone. Some
people haven't fallen as far as they are
going to or have not sunk as far as they
need to sink for the impact to b e th e r e .
There's a debt that has to be paid and
there are ru les that have to be
followed." Cash added. "Scripturcly.
there are plenty of places that say you
have to follow the government's rules."
South Africa Through A Tortured Eye
By Judith Dugan
WASHINGTON (UI*I) - In the fiction
of Nadine Gordlmer. there are as many
shades of meaning to an event as there
are lints of color in the faces of her
tort tired-and beloved South Africa.
Not that she condones in any way the
apartheid policies of her government.
All of her eight novels. Including Un
popular 198I allegory. "Ju ly 's People."
and most of her short stories have
political content. At least three of her
ixxiks have, at various times. lx-en
banned in South Africa
Gordlmer's personal politics are also
outspoken. She was among the signers
of an open letter protesting the pre
sence of Secretary of State George
Shultz at the International PEN Con
gress of writers In New York this
month, and boycotted the conference
opening.
But when It comes to her art. says
Gordlmer. 62. "the best way (a writer)
can serve society Is to write as well and
as truthfully as you can about the lift* of
the people."
Her novels are rich with people who
are fully human. White liberals, as in
the protagonist of "Burger's Daughter."
may lx- Indecisive and tortured. In "A
Guest of Honour." officials of a fledgl
ing black African government make the
same moral and political errors as their
"real" brethren In emerging nations.
The arrogant white landowner of "The
Conservationist" is allowed an eloquent
belief that what he does Is for the good
of the land.
"My Job In life Is to be a writer."
Gordimer said. "Maybe I’m wrong.
Maybe I should give that up and
become a pamphleteer, become a real
revolutionary
"(But) as writer I must be free to
write the truth as 1 see it. I think It's a
betrayal of any talent that you have to
put it at the service of a propaganda
machine.
"You simply betray the gift and don't
serve your society."
Gordimer was in Washington to read
from her latest short stories at a benefit
arranged by the Folgcr Shakespeare
Library to raise funds for the PENFaulkner Award. The podium was built
up to accomodate her: she is tiny —
barely five feet tall.
Her visit coincided with that of
Anglican bishop and Nobel Peace Prize
winner Desmond Tutu, whose beliefs —
if not his overt activism — she shares.
Quirks
"Unfortunately ... I agree with Bishop
Tutu that there is a very, very bad time
coming" lor South Africa. Gordimer
said. "T he whiles in general are so
Intransigent. They Just don't see that If
something isn't done the country Is
going to be reduced to increasing
misery and violence."
Her own beliefs about South Africa
formed early, even though her parents
— an English mother and Lithuanian
Jewish Immigrant father, were "typical
petit bourgeois." and not literary or
politically active. Gordimer said.
"It came from reading, from sud
denly becoming aware of the way we
lived, and questioning this in terms of
the general concepts of social Justice."
At "about age 12," in the mining
town of Springs, where her father was a
Jeweler and watch repairer, she read
Upton Sin clair’s "T h e Ju n g le." a
muckraking 1930s novel about hor
rendous practices and working condi
tions in U.S. slaughterhouses.
"I began to think about the condi
tions of workers and realized that this
was what was happening around me."

The Gramm-Kudman-Holllngs deficit
reduction bill is the most sweeping
change in Congressional budget pro
cedures ever.
It is common for the Congress to
resolve to balance the budget. Now it Is
on a timetable to do so. And the
timetable has teeth. Should the Con
gress fail to follow Its own schedule of
deficit reductions, the reductions will
occur anyway, by presidential order.
To find out what our representatives
in Congress think of what they have
done. I went to see my favorite senator,
the Honorable J . Homswoggle Windhorn.
Deficits have no greater enemy, and
no greater friend, than Senator Win
dham. While he has led the Senate In
denouncing deficits, his votes on spen
ding and revenue measures have
helped to make the deficit what It Is
today.
I asked Senator Wlndhom what he
thought of the new plan to eliminate
deficits,
"I was proud, yes proud, to give it my
vote." he said proudly. "As I have been
saying for some time. It is high time we
put this great country of ours on a
course of fiscal prudence. It is high time
we bring an end to these terrible
deficits."
I asked him what programs he
Intended to cut.
"Why none of them, of course!" he
said quickly. "This great country of
outs must have a strong defense, (t
must be generous in helping the less
fortunate, it must not turn Its back on
our senior citizens, i t ..."
I told the Senator I was surprised to
hear him advocate a tax increase.
"T ax increase? Don't be silly. A tax
Increase would sap the enterprising
spirit of this great country of ours. U
would endanger our economic pro
gress. We must stand firm against
those whinnying wastrels whose an
swer to everything Is to raise our
taxes!"
I was confused. 1 asked Senator
Wlndhom how he proposed meeting
the deficit reductions required by
Gramm-Rudman-Holllngs.
"Is THAT what's put the bee in your
bonnet?" he sniffed. "Relax. That bill
says we have to end the deficit by 1991.
There Is nothing to get upset about
now."
I told the Senator there was. The bill
provides for a fixed schedule of reduc
tions. The first, an $ 1 1 billion cut. goes
Into effect March 1.
"Thunder and tarnation! Let me see
?
that!"
I showed the Senator the bill. He read
hurriedly through Section 251. Beads
of perspiration began to form on his
brow.
"Good gracious Goldilocks! This Is
serious! This blamed bill really does
something!"
He started reading the rest of the bill,
looking for a loophole.
"Ah! Here we are! It says we only
have to predict that the budget will
meet these blasted targets. We can do
what we've always done — predict a
high rate of economic growth. That'll
make It look like we'll get a lot of tax
revenue and not need to spend much
on welfare and the rest."
I told him that was a possibility, but
that the bill requires a joint projection
of the deficit by the Congressional
Budget Office and the Office of Man
agement and Budget. The final estima
tion is made by the General Accounting
Office. Getting all three agencies to
cooperate In a bogus forecast could be

Gordlmer said. "I began to think. ‘Why
do they have to live in these barracks?
Why don’t they have their wives and

Her acclaimed and most recent book.
"Ju ly 's People." relates one version of
South Africa's possible fate — a white

" I’m sorry to say that some of that

kind of urban violence that has come to
a real crisis in that book." Gordimer
said. "Since (then) we've had that
bomb in a Pretoria street: we've had a
bomb in a Pretoria supermarket for the
first time, and we’ve also had roads
mined."
Gordlmer is working on another
novel, "but I'm superstitious and can't
talk about It until it's done." she said.
She has also moved into film and video,

This, and other studies reporting
simllur findings, led John Agresto.
Acting Chairman of the National En
dowment lor the Humanities to observe
that "despite the resurgence of Interest
in basic education and the billions
spent on schilling, we as Americans
may know less about our culture und
uur history than at any other time in
our nation's life."
The problem I s more serious than a
lack of knowledge in what some regard
as a dusty and dry academic discipline.
The absence of historical awareness
handicaps us In two ways, as individu
als and as American citizens. Dr.
Agresto asserts. "Without knowledge of
the world and the events before we
were born, we remain as children no
matter what our age."
Without an understanding of history,
we. as citizens of a democracy, are
ill equipped to make the Intelligent

demands. Very often, the decisions we
must make require moral Judgments.
Yet. If we are uninformed about this
country’s founding principles, its
culture and accomplishments. If we are
Ignorant of the ebb and flow of history,
we are Incapable of making those moral
Judgements.
To illustrate the dangers inherent In
this lack, consider a recent Washington
Post report that 9 6 percent of the
students In a local classroom, when
surveyed, saw no moral differences
between the United Stales and the
Soviet Union.
In response to this problem, and in
marking Us 20th anniversary, the
N a tio n a l E n d o w m e n t fo r th e
Humanities has launched a new Initia
tive which It calls "Understanding
America." Tills welcome and much
needed effort will encourage the
teaching of American history and
culture bv offering grants in program
areas such as curriculum development.
Integrating recent scholarship on the
,a
contributions of Immigrants, minorities
and women, and improvement ol
teaching methods and quality.
Some proposed programs, such is
supporting "schools Interested In re
establishing courses in Principles ol
American Democracy'... deserve to he
praised from the tops of Washington's
many monuments."
However, we musi realize that this
initiative will not achieve the necessary
levels of success unless all of us —
parents, educators, thought leaders,
the media and the average citizen —
back ll up with our own efforts and
encouragement.
Morris Lclbm an. a well-known,

Flea Collar Works
Recently I saw veterinarian Mike
Walsh’s article (Oct. 13. 1985) on the
Microtcch H Flea and Tick Collar. I
wish you would have contacted us to
comment on your experience with the
collar before you put the attached
urliclc 1o bed.
We have extensive test data on our
product and believe me when I say
i his — The Microtcch Collar unequiv
ocally repels llcas as long as It Is
functioning within specification. In
particular we have several long term
case studies on Microtcch that exceed
18 months of continuous use and
success In reducing or eliminating
llcas.
II my statement Is correct why did
you experience gradual Increase In
fleas? The answer bolls down to
environmental control. Please read on
for an explanation.
First some facts:
1. The Microtcch Collar does not kill
the fleas It effects because they can
leave the area. (If they remained
exposed at close range (l.e. 2 feet) for a
long period (l.e. several days) they
would die. So It Is not correct to call
PMBC sound "only an Irritant”).
2. The sound from the collar Is
directional. The sound Intensity level
emitted normally compensates for the
directionality. However the collar
must face the ground because of the
averaging effect of the sound intensity
vs. directionality It may take up to 3
days for the original fleas to leave the
pet. Generally fleas departing In the
3-5 day period were Introduced to the
pet after the collar was Installed.
3. When the pet Is lying on the
ground his body blocks the sound
from reaching the skin area in contact

Who Is accusing the Reverend Jerry

■ A

and praise of the man. ( neither like
nor dislike him. However I have a
better opinion of Falwell than of
McGovern. Falwcll has never tried to
spread anti-American propaganda
among our allies as McGovern has. If
McGovern Isn't a Communist he
behaved In a very odd way. I am a

Yes, I read what he wrote about

with the ground. So In this area fleas
may climb on the pet. Also If the
collar faces the sky. It Is not going to
work. In the case of a heavily infested
environment, the pet may move
aound In (he cnvtroment and lay on
fresh fleas several times per hour.
4. In heavily infested environments
or In the case of an outdoor pet. the
opportunity to Introduce fleas onto
the pet occurs so frequently that It
may appear that the Microtcch Collar
Is not working. This Is because the
fleas are climbing on as fast as they
arc being repelled. So although It Is
functioning. It will not be effective
unless cnvlromcnt control Is achieved
through area treatment. Then the
dumb on rate will he less than the
repel rate and the net will decrease.

What Newspapers Across
Microtcch’s effectiveness Is dramatic,
(l.e. fleas gone In 5 days). When a
customer complains that the unit
worked then stopped working over a
period of time, several possibilities
come to mind: The unit may have
been wet. damaged, test light left on.
faulty battery, or battery depletion;
the envlroment has such a high flea
hatch rale that It becomes Infested
quickly upon discontinu ance of
environmental control: the collar was
used Improperly.
We know from our warranty cards
that 40-50 percent of the pet owners
that purchased Microtcch find It very
effective after 30 days and some
people do return It because it is not
able to eliminate fleas by Itself.

I am Interested In any plan that will

I believe our scientists can do It. We

What'*. known as "low vision" can
r» ’gt‘ from nearly normal to nearly
blind, but there's always at least some
useful vision present.
If eye problems aren't caught early
and treated, some vision can be lost.
When your vision Is permanently
Impaired and can't be corrected by
ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses,
you have low vision.
Low vision has three major causes:
glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and
macular degeneration.
People with low vision "always have
some sort of clue — they can tell
whether It's night of day. or In which
direction to go." says Dr. Eleanor E.
Faye. She is the ophthalmologlcal
director of the Low-Vision Service of
T h e L ig h th o u se, the New York
Association for the Blind In New York
City.
Low-vision aids — special optical
devices or lenses that magnify an
Image — can make the most of that
remaining useful vision. Dr. Faye says
these aids can enable a person to
function Independently In his or her
own environment.
Ai d s a r e p r e s c r i b e d by
ophthalmologists or optometrists who
have special training in low vision.
Your own ophthalmologist can refer
vou to low-vision specialists In your
area or to agencies that can provide
help fusually your local Society for the
Blind).
These specialists do a low-vision
exam and prescribe the right type of
optical aids for your condition and
your activities. These aids may be
high-powered spectacles, hand magni
fiers or stand magnifiers that rest on a
page for reading. Also, there are
telescopic aids for helping near and
d istan t vtston. television-reading
machines and special glare-reducing
lenses.
You'll also be introduced to other
aids and services, such as large-prim
books, special radio programs or sta
tions. and tape-recorded books that
you can play at home. Other aids and
ap p liances include self-threading
needles, talk in g ca lc u la to rs and
large-prtnt clocks.
"In addition to low-vision aids," says
Dr. Faye, "Individuals might need
counseling. They might need to learn
some new homemaking skills, or to
learn how to get around Indepen
dently."
This is where orientation, mobility
and rehabllitiatlon instruction can
help. Orientation and mobility In
struction teach people how to get
around independently, while rehabilitratlon's major goal Is to help
them maintain themselves in their
homes as Independently as possible.
Some skills that can be taught are
how to reorganize the home. cook,
label clothes and canned goods, tell
time. Identify money and develop
personal-grooming techniques.
For a brochure about low vision,
send a long (bustness-slzlope to: The
Lighthouse, National Center for Vision
and Aging. Department C J. I l l E.

Nation Are Saying
In 100 Years, King's Words Will Still Inspire
By United Press International
The (Providence. R.l.) Journal-Bulletin
Looking out over the sea of nearly a quartermillion faces, mostly dark, the black comedian
said. "I haven’t seen so many of us all together
since Bull Connor turned on the hoses."
Dick Gregory's reference to the Birmingham
police commissioner's notorious crowd-control
tactics during civil rights skirmishes brought an
appreciative roar from the throng In front of the
Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28. 1963. For a white
newsman standing under a tree. It was discom
forting to realize that he was excluded from the
"u s."
And yet. a few hours later, a sooth-faced black
preacher ... gave an oration Intended to make us
Americans sec that the "u s" Includes all lovers of
freedom. A century from now. school children
will still be reading aloud the great passages from
the Washington speech by the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr .
The (Manchester. N.H.) Union-Leader
The European nations' anticipated negative
reaction to President Reagan's call for coopera
tion in Imposing economic sanctions against
terrorist Libya only serves to prove once again
that they — as well as some American busi
nessmen — place a higher priority on protecting
the almighty dollar than they do on defending the
sanctity of life.
West Germany has flatly rejected the sanctions.
Britain. Spain and Belgium expressed skepticism
and are almost certain to follow suit. ...
Meanwhile. U.S. taxpayers continue to cough up
billions of dollars to defend these nations
militarily.
Not to be Jingoistic, but there are times when
one senses that President Woodrow Wilson was
not simply Indulging In hyperbole when he said.
"America Is the only Idealistic nation In the
world."
And that was 67 years ago.
The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer
When the proposal for a national holiday
honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . was
being debated in Congress. I thought it was a bad
idea, and we wrote an editorial opposing i t ...
Ironically, the man who led the debate against
the King holiday demonstrated In the process —
more persuasively than almost anything ... short
of a Klan cross-burning — why we needed it.
When Sen. Je sse Helms dredged up longdiscredited "evidence" that King was. If not a
communist himself, at least operating under
communist Influence, all of our honest, pragmatic
arguments against another national holiday
suddenly were beside the point.
Sen. Helms framed the Issue In a different set of
options: We could either honor King or slander
him; we could either reaffirm his cause or rewrite
history to paint the civil rights movement as a
communist plot—
When the good people of North Carolina elected
(Helms) for a third term, that too underlined the
need for a Martin Luther King holiday...
As the song says, "he freed a lot of people."
white as well as black. But some people still arc
not free, and we need this holiday to keep hope
alive for them. Maybe even for Jesse Helms.
St. Petersburg (Fla.) Tlmea
To set an example for the rest of the federal
government. Prestdent Reagan has ordered that
the budget cuts under the Gramm-RudmanHolltngs Act should begin In the Reagans' private
living quarters at the White House.
Therefore. In the budget now being prepared to
take effect March 1. the annual appropriation for
running Mr. and Mrs. Reagan's quarters will be
slashed from S I 0.958.90 a day to $10,476.71 a
day.
It may lx* hard, but tn these tough times we’ve
all got to share the sacrifices.

Planned Parenthood Director
Excommunicated By Catholics
By M ichael J . Sp ataro
PROVIDENCE. R.I. (UPI) - The state
Planned Parenthood director, who was
excommunicated from the Roman Catholic
Church for supporting abortion, says she Is
ready to lead other Catholics In thc light for
"reproductive freedom."
Mary Ann Sorrcntlno. who has headed
Planned Parenthood for nine years, criti
cized thc Roman Catholic Church and the
diocese of Providence Wednesday for
’persecuting me for my personal beliefs."
"I don’t see that I represent anything that
Ted Kennedy hasn't represented, that
Geraldine Ferraro hasn’t represented along
with a lot of other prominent people."
Sorrcntlno said al a Statchouse news
conference. "I don’t know why the Pro
vidence diocese has singled me out."
Word of Sorrentino’s excommunication
surfaced Wednesday, the 13th anniversary
of the Supreme Court’s decision legalizing
abortion.
The diocese notillcd Sorrcntlno of her
excommunication by mall last summer, but
thc action did not become public until a
Providence minister mentioned It on a cable
television program about abortion.
"Your efforts have resulted In the sinful
termination of human life." diocese officials
said in the letter to Sorrentino. "The remedy
for this sad situation would be for you to
renounce your association with abortion
olln. :s and thc procurement of abortions."
Sorrcntlno said hundreds of Catholics
around New England have contacted her in
support.
”1 will always be a Catholic In my heart."
she said. "I can sit in my living room and
talk to God. I don'l have to go to their
church. I am willing to lead the segment of
Catholics that want the right of reproductive
freedom."
However Sorrcntlno, accompanied at the
news conference by four members of the
Rhode Island clergy, said she will still attend
church.
The excommunication, which has been
affirmed by Archbishop Pio Laghl, the
Vatican’s ambassador In Washington, pro
hibits Sorrentino from receiving commu
nion o r any other sacraments of the church.
"She has excommunicated herself by her
own choice to be director of Planned
Parenthood." a diocese official said.
"How many people In Rhode Island have
excommunicated themselves?" Sorrentino
countered. "The Catholic doctors who
perform them (abortions), the nurses who
assist them, the social workers who counsel
them ... or all of the people who singularly
use birth control."
Number Of Divorces Decline Again
Divorces have declined for the
second year in a row. That can
mean one of two things. Either
people are becom ing more
cau tio u s about whom they
marry in the first place or they
are deciding to work harder at
their marriages when trouble
comes.
Divorces came lo be fashion
able in the '60s and ’70s. If you
weren't getting all you had
expected from your marriage,
you went to a counselor who
encouraged you to get out of It.
Some people — usually those
who had a new partner waiting
for them outside when they
walked out the front door —
talked In glowing terms about
divorce. Their only regret was
that they had waited so lung.
Others expressed a curious
p a ra d o x a b o u t t h e ir new
divorced state. They admitted,
on one hand, they weren’t really
any happier now that they were
divorced — some were unhappler. all things considered — but.
on the other hand, they said
they wouldn't want to be back
with the old mate. Liberation
gave them a good feeling, even
Saints And
Sinners
George Plagetu
while it hurt.
There were those, however,
who saw in the rush from
marriage a tragic (law in our
characters. We no longer re
garded promises us something to
keep, impatient for personal
happiness now, wc weren’t
willing lo give time a chance.
Quitting was easier than a
commitment to make the rela
tionship work.
T h e c u r r e n t d e c lin e In
divorces might mean wc see now
how wrong we were.
The other theory we hear on
why marriages appear to be
stabilizing ts that wc are picking
our marriage partners more
carefully. This Implies that the
reason wc were rushing out of
marriage is that we were rushing
into it.
You must, of course, make
sure It is true love and not
moonlight and roses nudging
you Into matrimony. But In a
happy marriage, there may have
to be more than love.
One marriage counselor says.
"There arc three things to be
had out of marriage by a woman
— money, love and children.
Any two out of three (or all three)
will make for a reasonably
happy marriage.
If you ap p ly th a t l i t t l e
guideline to your own or friends’
marriages — past and present —
you can see there is more than a
measure of truth in it.
An old aunt of mine used lo
advise her nieces to "never
marry a man until you have
summered him and wintered
him." This could be Just another
way of saying you should know
him at least a full year before
you marry him.
Or It could have been Aunt
Winnie's warning that a man
who is loads of fun on the beach
in the summer could bore you
when the two of you are shut up
In the winter and you have to
make conversation with him.
Eleanora Wheeler, an elderly
parishioner of mine In Boston,
had her own way of predicting
whether a marriage could work.
It came out In a conversation I
had with her.
"BILL AND FRANCES ARE
PLANNING TO GET MARRIED,"
1 shouted to her. becau se
Eleanora. who was 90. was deaf.
"It won't work out." said
Eleanora. I was surprised to hear
her say that because I consid
ered the two young people
Ideally suited to each other. So I
said. "WHY NOT?"
"Bill likes to fish and Frances
can't stand even to be near the
water." said Eleanora.
Bill, of course, would Ash only
on the weekends In the summer
or when he was on vacation, but
Eleanora had a rule of thumb for
anybody contemplating mar
riage. "Always marry somebody
who likes to do the same things
you do on vacations." It was her
theory that. If a man and woman
like to spend their leisure time
doing the same things, they are
h a p p i l y m a t c h e d .
There may (or may not) be
something to it.
Bishop Opposes State Lottery, Casinos

Bishop Earl G. Hunt Jr . has Issued a
statement against a state lottery and

Parents Of Circumcised Hindu
Suing For Cultural Damages
DETROIT (UP1I — Hindu parents — claiming their son
suffered "serious cultural damage" when he was circumcised
at a local hospital — are suing the facility for more than
$10,000 in damages, it was reported Monday.
Charles Barr, an attorney for the unidentified family, told the
Detroit Free Press the child was circumcised two days after he
was bom April 27. 1984 at Hutzel Hospital.
Barr said the parents were told the child was circumcised
because the consent form was Inadvertently signed by another
woman at the hospital.
The circumcision. Barr said, was a "serious cultural Injury."
"It is my understanding that If the baby were in India he
would not be considered Hindu because of this. He would be
considered Muslim.” the attorney said.
He could not marry a Hindu girl who strictly observed
religious practices. Barr added.
"Circumcision In India typically distinguishes a Hindu from
a Muslim.” said Madhav Dcshpande. an Indian language
professor at the University of Michigan, who himself Is Hindu.
Rhe social stigma could stay with the child for life. Deshpande
told the paper.
"If this fact ts known, the Individual would be ostracized
from thc Hindu community," he said. "To have to explain the
circumstance Is Itself an embarrassment."

Ten years ago. the country suddenly

It was predicted that within 10 years all of
America would be measuring in meters,

and quarts.

require metric wrenches, but Ford and

standard system. Most grocery-product labels
carry both metric and non-metric units.
The liter, however, has practically disap

where it once had a firm foothold. Schools,
which heavily emphasized the metric system
10 years ago. now are teaching both metric
and the English systems.
The message must be that it is hard to get
people to change, especially If they are
comfortable with what they have. " If it ain't
broke, don't fix it." they are glad to advise.
Now. experts still are saying metric is
bound to come to America, but it will be a
slower process than first believed — perhaps
another 15 or 20 years before the country is
substantially converted.
Ten years ago we Joined the metric
bandwagon. We said editorially that it made a

Avoid A Heart Attack - Sleep Til Noon
WASHINGTON — Am ong the many advances
medical science has made lately Is the discovery
that the prime time for heart attacks is around 9
a. nt.
C o n v e r s e ly , a c c o r d in g to a H a r v a rd
cardiologist, the safest hour is 11 p.m.
You don't have to be a doctor to recognize the
significance of these findings. Even a laymen
who looks at the two periods attentively enough
can see a correlation, of sorts.
The post merldlcn hour falls after dark when
all sensible people are in bed asleep. The
morning hour, by contrast, arrives when most
people are awake If not already out on the Job.
The preventive step ts clear. If you wish to
avoid a heart attack — and who doesn't these
days? — sleep ’til noon.
that was not. I noted, among the conclusions
drawn by Dr. James Muller of the Harvard
Medical School. There Is no quarreling, howev
er. witli his observation that waking up raises
the blood pressure, thus putting additional
stress on the ol' bod. Particularly If one has set
an alarm clock.

quence and background of these
events tells us a great deal about
how tiie world will work in the
post-Geneva summit era.
There's good news and bad news.
The broadcasts were a plus for
America. The reason Is elementary.
We in America often get to hear the

public, said Churkin, wanted to

policy: "W here Is the Beef?" (Back
to colloquial school, Churkin.I
On the other hand, the Soviets
don’ t hear Western voices on their
evening television programs. (The
Soviets try to Jam foreign radio
broadcasts.) So getting Reagan's
message into Russia — unjammed,
on television, in prime time — is
good. After all. official Soviet posters
depict Reagan with missiles coming
out of his ears.
But what did Reagan say? He said
that we don't wish Russians harm,
that we want to cut nuclear arse
nals. that Star Wars Is peaceful, that
Americans and Russians will be
visiting each other, that we care
about human rights, that we want
settlements to armed conflicts.
All fine. But what didn't Reagan
say. and why didn't he say it?
That's the bad news. Just five
days after the- airport massacres.
Reagan didn't tell the world that
over the years the Russians and
their proxies have trained Palesti
nian terrorists in and out of Libya.
He didn't say that the Soviets are
providing an incredible array of

Why didn't Reagan make that

"hard-headed detente." going to
summits and trying to work out a
missile deal.

pressure than a telephone ringing in the dead of
night. Smalt wonder that the main "window of
vulnerability" for heart attacks opens at 6 a.m.
By the time one is sufficiently aroused to turn
ofT the bloody alarm, It may be too late. Zap! A
hour or so later, the old ticker goes bad.
It is. of course, embarrassing to have a heart
attack while taking a shower. Better to wait, if
possible, until you are dressed for work.
The ambulance driver will appreciate your
thoughtfulness, and so will the hospital
emergency ward staff.
Better yet. sleep until 9 a.m., so that if you do
have to go to the hospital In a ambulance, you
will at least be wearing pajamas.
If. however, you customarily retire for the
evening in footsie Jam-Jams, forget it. Almost
nothing can provide a red-face faster than for an
adult, old enough to have heart trouble, arriving
at an emergency ward clad in children's
nightwear.
Unfortunately. Muller does not address my '
Idea of avoiding heart attacks by seeking
employment that permits you to sleep until
noon and get to bed before midnight.
I'm sure, however, that your boss will
cooperate. Unless you happen to be working In a
hospital emergency ward.
There are always a few people who will huve
mid-morning coronaries regardless, and for
them nothing could be mure unsettling than to
be told the emergency ward staff is still in bed.
Such Information could send your blood

the effect could be even more devastating than a
poor electrocardiogram reading.
Muller notes that doctors tend to remember

There is no doubt a 9 a.m. heart attack is

Reed Irvine, the contentious

here. First, remember that Irvine's

Aretha, 14. was diagnosed
as having the rare syndrome
last week. It affects Just 1 in

Aretha was suffering from
the flu when she was ad

transferred to Florida South
where Casselberry physician
Steven Van Ore diagnosed

through an ascending paral

Chris Riggins said Aretha
can move her arms but not
her legs. She is still on a
respirator to facilitate her
breathing. She Is also being
given metabolic support.
Aretha, the daughter of Joe
and Cora Lee Riggins of
Sanford, was a starter on the
volleyb a ll and basketball
teams as a freshman and was
expected to be a brilliant
addition to the girls' track
team.

He consulted Harrison’s

pocket to avoid the Bears' pass rush.
McMahon has been sacked only 43
times, a eretlli in the Bears' preference
in run and an Improved offensive line.
But he also hasn't had to p.i-,s In-- team
to a fourth quarter victory all season

execute a two-mlnutc offense to win a

Eason and Marino should both be

Eason was one or five quarterbacks

Eason mostly has shared the Job

Special to tilt Herald
Eric Hccsman scored five goals and Scan
Makey added two to pace Norm Wight’s
Lake Howell Silver Hawks to a 9-1 drubbing
or the Seminole's Fighting Scmlnoles in
prep soccer action at Lake Howell Thursday
night.
The Silver Hawks improved their record
to 5-2-1 with the win while roach Carlos
Mcrllno's Scmlnoles dropped lo 0-10. The
Lake Howell varsity will he in action
Saturday against Boone at 2 o’clock while
the Junior varsity plays at noon. Seminote
hosts Jones Monday at 7 p.m.
The Silver Hawks jumped nut to an early
4-0 halftim e lead before putting the
finishing touches on the helpless Scmlnoles.
The only score for the Scmlnoles was a
second-half shot by Matt Albert.
Even though the 'Noles were never in tingame, there Is much progress from the
earlier part of the season, according to
Wight.
"Seminole has nothing to be ashamed of."
hr said respectfully. "T h e y ’re Improving
every time they play. Give them a little lime
and they should be eomlng up."
The Silver Hawks had no problem getting
up already, as the scoreboard signified.
Along with the five goals by Keesmun and
the two by Makey. Jeff Shlrkey and Eric
Bird contributed one each to top off the
scoring.
Tite Sliver Hawks shot 27 llmrs more
Soccer
than the Scmlnoles. 30-3. and may have a
spark in the works for lheir season,
according to Wight.
"They worked hard tonight." Wight said.
"They're trying to get some confidence back
and they did pretty well In getting some of It
back. I really hope this Is the turning point.
We have all of the ability and we’re playing
well: il’sjust a matter of finishing."
While the Silver Hawk varsity squad was
putting in goals left and right, the Lake
Howell Junior varsity was having some luck
at scoring also. The JV Silver Hawks
blanked the Scmlnoles. B-0.
CAM PBELL'S ROCKET ZA P S TRIBE
The Lady Silver Hawks of Lake Howell
scored one goal in the second period to
overcome the Lady Seminolcs of Seminole
High 1-0 In girls prep soccer action
Thursday night at Lake Howell.
Only 12 minutes into the second half.
Tory Campbell took a nice pass over the
right side of the field from Kathy DiFonzo
anil till a rocket from 15 feel into the upper
right hand corn er oT the goal after
Seminole's keeper. Sherri Rumler. almost
saved the shot from going through.
"It was a good game." Lady Sliver Hawk
head coach Art Raynor said. "Seminole had
a couple of people that were hurt and that
affected the game. There weren't that many
good shots all night except that one."
Seminole head coach. Suzy Reno agreed
with Raynor that the absence of key players
hurt the 3-10-1 Lady Scmlnoles. "Angle
Freeman and Jennifer Roberts are both out
and Kim Walsh hurt her ankle.” Reno said.
"Th at only left me with Cindy Benge on
defense and she played well but couldn’t do
it all."
The Lady Silver Hawks (3-3-1) outshot the
Lady Seminolcs 29-9 to overcome a score
less first half, but the defensive show
belonged to Rumler.
Kumlcr had 24 saves on the night and
almost prevented the only score o f the
game; however, the shot from Campbell was
too hard and fast for Rumler and all she
could manage to do was deflect the ball Into
the upper portion of the net.
"Sherri (Rumler) never saw the shot
com ing." Reno said. ’’She still had a good
night as keeper.”
Raynor agreed. "Sherri's (Rumler) a really
nice player." Raynor said. "She's been
having a pretty good season thus far. The
game really wasn't won by the score, but by
the midfield play oYour players."
Both teams return to action this Saturday
as the Lady Silver Hawks host the Lady
Hornets of Bishop Moore while the Lady
Scmlnoles host P.K. Yonge.
In other action Thursday, there was no
report from the Oviedo-Winter Park girls’
game.

DEAR READER - To begin
with, penicillin Is ineffective
against viruses. It Just doesn't
work and. In the opinion of
experts, should be limited to
therapy for specific bacterial
Infections. It is not appropriate
for flu.
While there Is no guaranlcc
that flu shots will protect you
from all types o f Influenza. I
believe you would be helped by
having a flu shot every year. The
Injections may enhance your
Immune system so that you are
not as susceptible to each annu
al variety of flu virus. Ask your
doctor If he or she would consid
er giving you flu shots.

benefit you tremendously.

Gardening
It's Tim s To Plan Your Backyard Vegetable Garden
' The mild weather wc*vc been
having tells us that spring is not
too far away. And. It’s time to
start planning your backyard
vegetable garden. This may
sound familiar to experienced
gardeners, but a brief review
shouldn't hurt anyone. Maybe it
will help those trying vegetable
gardening for the first time.
Nearly ull vegetables cun be
grown In fair area, If you plant
them In the right seasons. The
important thing Is to grow vege
tables that you and your family
enjoy.
;Thc first consideration In
planning your garden Is where
to put It. You want It fairly close
to your house, so It's handy to
work In. And. you want It near
an outside water faucet to make
Irrigation eusier. The thing you
really want to be sure about Is
proper light. If possible, locate
the garden so It gels full sunlight
idl day. Unfortunately, some of
us don’ t enjoy that luxury.
Thus, we huve to choose be
tween morning sun and after
noon sun. Fruiting crops, such
as tomatoes, corn, cucumbers,
and melons, will have to be
planted where you get the most
sun. Leaf and root crops general
ly can stand a little shade.
You m ay want to fence off
your garden to keep out dogs
and children. In som e areas of
the county, wild animals, such
as rabbits, can be a problem, too.
A fence also can serve as a trellis
for pole beans, tomatoes, and
other crops that need support.
You may need to protect your
crops from nearby tree and
shrub roots, which will compete
with vegetables for available
nutrients and water. To give
your crops the edge, dig a trench
about one-and-one-half to two
feet deep all around the garden.
Line one side of the trench with
roofing paper or heavy plastic
film, then refill the trench. This
forms a barrier against the mots
of nearby plants.
Naturally, good soli Is impor-

tant. Most of us have to do the
best we can with the kind of soil
we have. However, we can give
our gardens a real boost by
mixing In plenty of organic
material, such as compost, ma
nure. sawdust or anything else
you can think of. With such soil
amendments, we can grow vege
tables even IT our own soil is
nothing but sand.
Before you ever plant the first
seeds, you need to think about
the vegetable varieties you'll
choose to grow. You could walk
Into the nearest garden supply
store and buy whatever you sec.
But. remember that vegetable
varieties differ In quality, disease
resistance, and climate adapt
ability. which can be vitally
Important. Be sure you select
varieties that are recommended
for our area.
Proper garden design can spell
the difference between success
and failure. Your garden plan
should Include several things —
the location of each crop — the
amount to be planted — the
planting date — and, the variety
o f each vegetable you intend to
grow. Try to plan your garden so
crops that will be planted on the
same date, and reach maturity
about the same time, arc close
together. By setting up different
groups, or blocks, within the
garden, you'll be able to keep
your garden in production as
much as possible.
Within each block, arrange
crpps by size. Starting from east
to west, plant low-growing types,
such as radishes, turnips, and
lettuce, along one side. Plant
those of medium height, such as
peppers and squash. In the
middle of the block. Sweet corn,
pole beans, and stake tomatoes
can be planted along the other
side. This avoids having the
low-growing vegetables stuck in
the shade of taller plants. Run
your rows north and south, so
each row will receive the same
amount of sun.
You can plant two or more
crops in a single row, too. as long
as they require about the same
spacing. You can even mix crops
of different sizes in the same
row. For example, you could
Interplant a fast growing crop,
like radishes, with a slowgrow ing crop. T h e radishes
would be picked before the
slower maturing plants need the
space.
Don’t plant too much of one
crop at a time, especially those
vegetables that must be eaten
shortly after they're harvested.
To have fresh product over a
longer period, plant smaller
amounts ol the same crop at
10-to-14-day intervals. Beans,
sweet corn, and peas fall Into
this category. Be sure you plant
sweet com in blocks rather than
In single rows — you’ll get better
pollination and help produce
more corn.
It's best to design your garden
so you can rotate crops from
year to year. If you avoid grow
ing the same crops, or the same
type of crops. In the same spot
more than once every three or
four years, you may reduce the
build-up of soil borne diseases
which can reduce yields or even
wipe our your crop.
Now's the time to gel a head
start on your garden — on paper.
It's too early to be planting most
crops, hut you can start plann
ing — selecting the proper site,
choosing the right crops, and
setting up a good design — all to
increase your chances o f pro
ducing a successful spring vege
table garden.
Happy gardening?

I would, however, insist on one
rule: If there Is any snacking in
the bedroom, all dishes and
leftovers should be taken to the
kitchen Ik -fore bedtime.
DEAR ABBY: Please help me.
I am 28 and the mother of two
darling children. I've been hap
pily married for five years and I
really love my husband. He's
good to me and the kids, but
here’s the problem: I am very
much attracted to my husband's
brother, and he's attracted to
me. We kid around and flirt a lot.
but haven't done anything about
It except maybe a quick kiss in
the kitchen. Abby. U's getting
harder and harder to fight these
feelings.
Maybe if I have a fast fling
with ihls guy and get It over
with. I will finally get him out of
my system.
What do you think?
ALL IN THE FAMILY
DEAR ALLt I t hi nk you
should try harder to right these
feelings. No flirting, no eye
contuct. no kidding around, and
no quick kisses in the kitchen or
anywhere else.
Forget the fast fling. It could
fling your marriage right into the
divorce court.

sincere layperson delivered an
impassioned address, closing
with. "W ould those who would
like to rededicate their lives,
please coinc forward and kneel
at the altar?”
As I looked around the church.
I saw that about three-fourths of
the congregation was over 55
years ofage.
As anyone Involved in the
health care field can tell you.
their reason for not wanting to
kneel could range from A to V —
arthritis to vertigo.
Please inform the clergy to
consider the age of most church
co n grega tio n s and use the
phrase. "C om e forward and
gather at the altar" Instead of
kneel. I'm sure the response will
be greater.

MIAMI (UPI)
The report of a man overboard from a
cruise ship launched the Coast Guard on a busy 24-hour
period that saw (he service make three other unrelated
rescues.
The olTand-on search for the mnn overboard was called
off late Thursday with no trace of anyone bobbing in the
Atlantic Ocean. A 6-year-old boy aboard the erulsellner
Emerald Seas alerted the crew that he thought he had seen
a man overboard, said Coast Guard Petty OfTh-cr Dan
Waldschmidt.
The Emerald Seas was about 40 miles east o f Miami
8caJrch f,,r « man overboard began about 3 pin.
EST Wednesday. A passenger count aboard the cruise ship
later showed no one was missing, and there were no
reports of other missing boaters.
Coast Guard vessels searching for him were diverted bv
three unrelated rescues. In the following 24 hours. Coast
Guard vessels searching the area near the southern
Bahamas rescued a couple from a disabled sailboat, twice
aided 10 passengers aboard a pleasure boat that was taking
on water, and saved nine crewmen who lied a sinking
Haitian freighter.
Group Would Ban Cablo Porn
TALLAHASSEE (UPI) — A coalition o f church leaders,
women's groups and parents Thursday urged a ban on
pornography on cable television, claiming It promotes
deviate sex and rape.
Barbara Hattemer. coordinator for the Coalition for Clean
Cable, said In a news conference that the group will stir
grassroots support for. and monitor compliance with a bill
by Rep. Herb Morgan. D-Tallahassre. to make It a
misdemeanor to broadcast porn over cable lines.
Second olTenses would be treated as felonies.
The bill refers to “ ultimate sexual acts, normal oi
perverted, actual or simulated: masturbation: human
sexual or excretory organs or functions: or a display,
description, or representation In lurid detail of the violent
physical torture or dismemberment of a person.”
"Children cannot see this material without being affected
by It." Hattemer said. "T h e y assimilate It into their
consciousness without imitating It. We have an epidemic or
children seeing graphic sex on cable and acting it out on
younger, helpless children."
She added: "A ll Ibis in the name of freedom. Whose
freedom? Certainly not m v freedom In bring up my
children In a decent society."
Group Funds Pay Equity Study
TALLAHASSEE (UPI) — Spurned three vears running by
the Legislature, a coalition o f women s'an d civil rights
groups and labor unions announced Thursday il is
preparing Its own study o f pay equity for women and
minorities In Florida government.
Rep. Helen Gordon Davis. 1) Tampa, said al a news
conference that she hopes the private study will prompt
lawmakers next spring to raise salaries In job's traditionally
held by blacks. Htspanics and women if Inequities arefound — and that the private sector will follow- suit.
Davis called pay equity "th e most important and
overriding human rights Issue o f the decarle."
She said 20 states have begun or completed studies ol
comparable worth to employers or Jobs traditionallv held
by men and women. Nine have acted lo erase disparities.
New York state, which has roughly double Florida's
77.000 employees, spent $34 million on its pav equity
plan. Davis said.
Business groups have opposed any pay equity study,
claiming the market, not bureaucratic formulas, should sei
pay.

Contlnscd from page 1A
CALNO Is eyeing floating formulas based on
data which Includes the five most recent years of
transportation expenditures. Three of the plans
also call for half the revenues to the cities to be
distributed based on such criteria as population,
general fund transportation expenditures, pro
perty values and lane miles maintained by the
cities.
The county's adopted distribution plan calls for
a 30-year frozen formula. In which the four cents
is distributed based on transportation expen
ditures prior to 1983 while the two-ccnt tax Is
divided up based on expenditures five years
previous to 1985.
The gas tax funds are being collected by the
state but they have not been distributed because
the cities cannot agree to one formulu.

Altamonte Springs appealed the Issue to the

CALNO Chairman Constantine said the city has
asked that the formula not be frozen, and he feels
the Cabinet agreed when It told the county and
cities this week to devise a new distribution plan.
"That's what we were asking for and the
Cabinet scented inclined to agree wit It our
position." he said.
The council agreed that the county should keep
a fixed percentage of the revenues, but that the
five-year revolving formula Is the "best and most
equitable w a y " lo distribute the funds am ong the
cities. Constantine said.
"That way. the more they spend (for trunsjxirtatlon each year) the more (gas lax) they will get,"

the shootings.
"T h e note we found said Mr. Sperry was 'very

"Each city hus Its own priorities, but they
cannot look Just at how much they will get this

Constantine said he Is hopeful CALNO can gel a
unanimous agreement on a formula bv the end of
the month.
"T h e y are under the gun. They have to make a
decision.” he said. When an agreement is
reached, the cities must 'live with" the furl that
the revenues they receive will change from year
to year. Constantine added.
T h e county Is willing to go along with whatever
formula the cities "are willing to sign." said
Deputy County Attorney Bob McMillan. The
county, though, believes the Cabinet has leaned
toward the plan it has adopted, a formula the
state legislature directed be used, lie said.

the insider. "Viewers didn't

jyw lm HtfiM,
said, are Elvis Presley. Jerry
Lee Lewis. Buddy Holley, Bill
Haley and. more recently.
Willie Nelson. Waylon Jen
nings and other country artists.
"When Elvis was a youngster
he was listening to all types of
music. He made some de
monstration records for Sun
that were Immltations of Dean
Marlin. Obviously Elvis learned
whatever music he knew from
listening to records. He didn't
learn it from sheet music.
"S o he listened as any young
kid would do to the range or
m u s i c b e i n g p l a y e d . He
listened to country music, ob
viously. The point Is he also
listened to a type of music
which he was forbidden to
listen to by the tenets of the
religion his parents followed.
T h ey didn’ t want him to listen
to Big BUI Broonzy and Arthur
"B ig Boy" Crudup. but he was
l i stening lo them. At this
particular time it was their
m usic, their rhythm, their
drive which attracted him. and
that ultim ately shaped the
style for which he became
known."
Country music’s pendulum
has swung back In the direc
tion of traditional forms and
some observers have viewed
this as a move away from
outside Influences. Including
black.
But Shaw doesn’t see It that
way.
" I ’ve watched country music
develop. There has been as
much a crossover o f black
artists as there has been In the
so-called popular field . In
watching the Grand Ole Opry
there arc a fair number o f black
artists appearing. I'm disposed
lo say that so-called traditional
opposition of country-folk to
black influence has no real
validity now."
Shaw said there has to be
variety In any form of music
and some are going to be more
traditional than others.
“ No matter how dominant
the trend you always have the
fringes. I don’t think country Is
all white."
He noted that back In the old
days drummers were hidden
behind a curtain when they
appeared on the Grand (Me
Opry.
"That's gone now. What we
think as traditionalism Itself
has undergone changes. A lot
of people couldn't believe It
when Ray Charles started
singing country songs.
"The general public is always
a little bit behind. When it
comes to the field c^f scholar
ship black infusion of styles
Into popular music Is authen
ticated. A fair num ber of
scholars say we should not talk
of American poplar music but
Afro-American popular music.
The fusions today predominate,
over so-called pure examples."

FrMpy, Jbn. H, 1 9 -1
UFITVKsfBEtsr
Disney movies are coming
back to Sunday night televi
sion — but they have grown
up since they went off the air
in 1983.
Don’t expect X-rated Dis
ney films, but look for a
variety of subject matter
aimed at drawing the whole
family around the television
act.
Rich Prank, president of
the motion picture and tele
vision division of Walt Disney
Pictures, believes that with
Disney TV movies becoming
more adult and audiences
re tu rn in g to more co n
servative values — the timing
Is good for the new venture
scheduled to begin on ABC in
February.
“ I happen to believe
personally that there has
been a return to a little more
conservative, family-oriented
programing." Frank said In
an Interview.
"You are seeing it in Ihe
w i l l i n g n e s s to wa t c h
’ Highway to Heaven.* and In
a u d i e n c e w i l l i n g n e s s to
watch four older women in a
show called 'Golden Girls.’"
"Golden Girls" is a Disney
product, produced under the
Touchstone label because, as
Frank said, "it’s too adult for
Disney and we don't want to
confuse people."
The old Disney show was
first telecast on Oct. 27. 1954
on ABC. eventually made the
rounds o f all three networks
and wound up in 1983 as the
longest-running prime time
scries in network television
history.
Frank said the shows In
cluded a certain amount of
original product, nature
shows and animated pro
grams. but very often what
appeared on television were
theatrical movies broken up
into two parts.
"Our thrust now." Frank
said, "is to do almost entirely
original productions that are
very contemporary In style
and will appeal to the whole
family. We may skew more
toward children one week,
then the next week present a
piece with more serious con
tent that would appeal to the
older members of the family.
"W e are striving for a mix
of programs that will become
a habit for the whole family
to sit dow n and watch
together on a Sunday night
like they used to do.
"Television once was very
family oriented and people
watched together. Then they
started getting multiple sets
In the house and the au
dience fragmented. We think
we will give them a reason to
sit down together again.”
.To Illustrate his point, he
outlined some of the story '
lines Disney has in develop
ment.
- ’The Girl Who Spelled
F r e e d o m ” f o l lo w s the
adventures of a Cambodian
refugee family from the
Jungles of southeast Asia to
their new home in South
Carolina. They can’t speak
English and even modem
In d o o r p l u m b i n g la a
mystery. The older daughter
of the family eventually
qualifies for Ihe finals of a
national spelling competi
tion. Wayne Rogers and Mary
Kay Place play the Ameri
cans who sponsor the fami
ly's emigration.
— "Y o u n g A g a in " stars
Robert Urfcii as a 40-year-old
man suffering a mid-life crisis
who. thanks to movie magic,
gets his wish and returns to
age 17 — knowing every
thing he knew at 40.
—"T h e Fighting Choice."
Frank said, was the most
serious piece on the Disney
TV menu so far. It Is about a
boy. 16. who suffers from
epilepsy. He has been on
medication to control grand
mal seizures — but the
medication is becoming less
effective. He learns that an
experimental brain operation
could help him.
His parents. Beau Bridges
and Karen Valentine, don't
want him to have the surgery
because it could lead to
permament brain damage.
The boy. determined to try.
goes to court and sues his
parents.
Disney also will offer some
shows In the old vein.
" W e run the g a m u t."
Frank said. "There's also
’The Richest Cat In the
World.’ about a talking cat
that Inherits a lot of money.
He only talks to some people.
Now that Is In the old Disney
mode.
"Incidentally, it’s not easy
to nuke a cat move his Ups
all the time. The trick is
peanut butter. You smear
some on their Ups and they
lick U off."
'
V ocalist S c h u u r Is
b l e s s e d wi t h s o me
mighty fine company on
this o u tin g — D av e
Grusln, who doubles on
keyboards and produc
ing. Stan G ets. Lee
Rltenour. and. on two
tracks, Jose Feliciano.
She puts her soul Into
her singing, and the
stellar accompaniment
kicked this one Into high
gear. Just listen to "It
Don't Mean A Thing (If It
Ain’t Got That Swing)."
T he Duke w o u ld be
proud. (GRP A-1022) 1

etw orks Determ ine W hat Shows A re Pre-empted
Dear Dick — Who or what determines which
w la pre-empted for a special? I'm xetttnx so
d of "Riptide” being pre-empted! - B.8..
arlllo, Teaaa.
That decision Is solely the responsibility of the
lirrc m ajor networks. ABC. CBS and NBC.
hcorctically. they try to alternate their preinptions. so no one show Is taken off more than the
ihcrs. But, In reality, they play ratings games wllh
reempttons. trying lo slot specials against weak
hows on the other networks, trying to get viewers
o watch their network on certain nights, trying all
sorts o f other corporate schemes. And shows that
gel pre-empted frequently - such as your “ Riptide"
— often complain, but to no avail. It's Just the way
things are done.
Dear Dick — My wife and 1 recently watched
the movie. “Meet Me In 8t. Louts," with Judy
Garland. While watching. 1pointed out that the
father of thle lovely family waa played by aetor
Walter Abel. My wife said. "Absolutely not!”
Who buys lunch? — O.A.8.. Muskegon. Mich.
You do. The father was played by Leon Ames.
Ames and Abel look alike, and they each have a last
name that begins with A and has four letters, but
you can't weasel out o f it that way. You buy lunch

this time.
Dear Dick — For the last few weeks, a friend
and I have been going around In circles about
something we hope you ean help ua with. She
Insists that Traecy Gold, the girl who plays
Carol on "Growing Pains,” Is the same girl who
played Tracy on "The Partridge Family.” I
disagree. A steak diansr la riding on your
answer. Who gets the bill? — J.P.. Knoxville.
Tenn.
I hope you enjoy your steak. Tracy Partridge was
played by Suzanne Crough.
Dear Dick — la actor Richard Dean Anderson
the son of actor Richard Anderson, who was the
boat on the "Bionic Woman” series? — T.8..
Fleetwood, Pa.
No. he's not.
Dear Dick — As so many of your questions

Dear Dick — Could you please tell me If Core >*
Halm, who woo Peter lu the movie "A Time to
Live,” played la the movie "Sliver Ballet"?
How old la he? I really think he's cutett In reel
life, does he have muscular dystrophy? Is ther
any way to gst rid of It? I sure hope sol! — M.L
Houston, Taaas.
Yes. Corey was In "Stiver Bullet." No. he doesn :

13-ycar-old. You ean see your cutey-pte soon in Ih

Dear Dick — l'd like to know If Rhea Perlman

Yes. Rhea Is Mrs. DeVito. I hope you are the rl« li
