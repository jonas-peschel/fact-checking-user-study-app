Registering for the LSAT
How do I register for the LSAT?
Registration for the 2025-2026 testing year, which began with the August 2025 LSAT, is now open. For the 2025-2026 testing year, the LSAT fee is $248.
You can learn more about upcoming test dates and registration deadlines by visiting Upcoming LSAT Dates.
Most test takers have the choice of taking their test in an online, live remote-proctored environment, or in person at a Prometric digital testing center. Our goal is to give test takers the choice of whichever option works best for them.
LSAC is committed to providing necessary testing accommodations for the LSAT and LSAT Argumentative Writing to candidates with documented disabilities. Your request must be submitted by the accommodation request deadline associated with your test date. Please note that test takers who were previously approved to receive accommodations for the LSAT will automatically receive the same or equivalent accommodations when they register for an upcoming LSAT. More information is available in the LSAC Policy on Accommodations for Test Takers with Disabilities.
Will I be able to choose my testing day and time?
Regardless of whether you choose to test online in a live, remote-proctored environment or in person at a test center, you will have the opportunity to choose the day and time that works best for your schedule from the available options.
You can find the date that scheduling opens for each test by clicking the links at Upcoming LSAT Dates. Additionally, LSAT registrants will be notified via email when scheduling opens for their administration.
Test takers who prefer to test at a certain time of day, or who need a specific start time due to other obligations, should schedule their test as early as possible, as slots are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.
Please check LSAT Scheduling to learn when scheduling opens and closes for the next LSAT.
If you’re unable to schedule your test by your administration's test-center scheduling deadline, you can opt to request a test date change (fees will apply) through your LSAC JD account. Otherwise, your test registration will be automatically withdrawn (without a refund).
Can I change my test administration?
Yes, if the test date change deadline has not yet passed for the administration to which you are registered, you may change your test date through the LSAT Status page of your LSAC JD account. Note that additional fees may apply.
Please review the Test Date Change policy for more information.
Can I change from a test center to remote testing?
Yes, in most cases. If you have scheduled a testing time at a test center and you decide you would rather test remotely, you can go into Prometric’s ProScheduler tool and reschedule your test.
If you have approved testing accommodations, note that certain accommodations are best administered in a test center modality. If you have been approved for accommodations that require a test center modality, you will not be able to reschedule for a remotely proctored test and will not be able to change your test center.
Additionally, international test takers who will use assistive technology to take the LSAT, and test takers who have an accommodation that includes a pencil-and-paper format of the test, must test in a test center.
Can I change from remote testing to a test center?
You can only change from remote testing to a testing center if the seven-day deadline to schedule for a test center has not passed.
Note that certain accommodations are best administered in a remote modality. If you have been approved for accommodations that require a remote modality, you will not be able to reschedule at a test center.
Can I change the day or time on which I’m testing within the same LSAT administration?
Yes, so long as the scheduling deadline has not yet passed. Scheduling for test centers closes seven days after scheduling opens. Scheduling for remotely proctored tests closes three days before testing begins. Specific deadlines for each administration are available at Upcoming LSAT Dates.
Please note that any changes must be made through the Prometric ProScheduler tool.
Can I be assured that my test date will not interfere with my Sabbath observance?
Yes. The LSAT is administered over several days. Test takers will be able to schedule their testing time for non-Saturday test dates, in accordance with their religious observance.
I have a fee waiver and need to withdraw my registration. What should I do?
You may withdraw your LSAT registration on the LSAT Status page of your LSAC JD Account once your administration’s refund request deadline has passed. You must complete your withdrawal by 11:59 p.m. (ET) the night before you are scheduled to test. Once your registration is withdrawn, you may register for another LSAT administration within your two-year fee waiver period.
Under what circumstances would I be ineligible to take the LSAT?
- If you plan to take the LSAT within 24 months of: (a) having either supervised or remotely proctored the LSAT, (b) having been employed or engaged by a third-party LSAT service provider, (c) having been employed or engaged by LSAC to perform obligations that are related to the LSAT, or (d) are a relative of or employed by any individual employed by LSAC, you must notify LSAC prior to registering for the test. Subject to the Intended Use Policy set forth in Section 34, the Limitations on Candidates Taking the Test set forth in Section 7, and the Prohibited Behaviors set forth in Sections 16 and 28 and otherwise in the Candidate Agreement, LSAC will review your request for registration and may, at LSAC's discretion, honor the registration or offer an alternative test location and/or date. Any request must be received by LSAC no later than three (3) days prior to the registration deadline for the applicable administration. Failure to abide by this requirement may result in the initiation of a misconduct and irregularities proceeding.
- If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of the LSAC Candidate Agreement, you will not be permitted to take the LSAT.
- Test takers will not be permitted to retake the LSAT if they have already scored a 180 (perfect score) within the current and five past testing years, the period in which LSAC reports scores to law schools.
- If you have exceeded the LSAT’s test-taking limits, your registration will not be accepted.
How many times may I take the LSAT?
Test takers are permitted to take the LSAT:
- Five times within the current reportable score period (i.e., since June 2020).
- A total of seven times over a lifetime.
Important Notes
- Tests taken prior to September 2019 will not be counted toward these numerical limits, along with the Exceptions listed below.
- Canceled LSAT scores, including those canceled with the Score Preview option, will be counted against these numerical limits, whereas absences and withdrawals will not.
- Test takers will not be permitted to retake the LSAT if they have already scored a 180 (perfect score) within the current reportable score period (i.e., since June 2020).
Exceptions to This Policy
- With the introduction of the LSAT-Flex to provide a safe and effective mechanism for candidates to earn scores during the COVID-19 emergency, LSAC made the decision that the May, June, July, and August 2020 LSAT-Flex tests do not count toward these limits.
Test takers who have special circumstances and want to request an exception to this policy may submit an appeal.
By accepting the Candidate Agreement, what am I authorizing LSAC and law schools to do?
Accepting the Candidate Agreement means that you are giving LSAC permission to release information from your file — including, but not limited to, the information contained on the Candidate Agreement form, your LSAT score, and information regarding any alleged misconduct or irregularities in the admission process. You are also giving the law schools to which you apply permission to release information to LSAC.
What else am I agreeing to by accepting the Candidate Agreement?
By accepting the Candidate Agreement, you are certifying that you are the test taker whose name appears on the registration, and that you plan to take the LSAT for the sole purpose of being considered for admission to law school. You are further certifying that all the information on the form, as well as other information and materials submitted to LSAC for your file, are complete and accurate.
How do I make changes to my profile information (e.g., preferred/chosen name, legal name, date of birth) after I have registered for the LSAT?
JD candidates can make updates to their profile information, including first name (legal and preferred/chosen), last name, date of birth, and Social Security/Insurance number, through their LSAC JD Account . Visit the “Profile” page in the “My Account” menu to make changes. You may be required to upload documentation to support certain biographical information changes, such as Social Security/Insurance number, date of birth, and legal first and last name. For more information, please visit Biographical Information Changes.
This is important. To be permitted to take the LSAT, the first and last name listed on your ID must exactly match the legal first and last name listed in your LSAC online account.
Testing and Equipment Requirements
What kind of equipment do I need in order to take the LSAT remotely?
To take the LSAT remotely, you’ll need:
- A quiet, well-lit, private, enclosed room in which to take the test with a table or desk and a chair. Please note that transparent glass walls are not considered part of a private room and are prohibited.
- A laptop or desktop computer with one of the following active and licensed operating systems: Windows 8.1, MacOS 10.13 to 12.6.5, MacOS Ventura 13.3.1 and above, MacOS Sonoma, or MacOS Sequoia.
- A screen resolution of 1024x768.
- A webcam with a resolution of 640x480p and a microphone. If you are testing on a desktop computer, the webcam must be external.
- A strong and stable Internet connection with a download speed of at least 1.0 mbps.
- The latest version of the Google Chrome web browser.
- Administrative rights to the computer on which you’ll take the test. (This is so you can download the required proctoring software.)
Run a System Readiness Check at Prometric
We encourage you to test your machine using Prometric’s convenient tool before scheduling opens, and to familiarize yourself with the test’s user interface by trying our free practice tests and tutorials on LawHub®. This will ensure that you know how to eliminate and select responses.
What kind of equipment do I need in order to take the LSAT at a test center?
All equipment and materials, including scratch paper and pencils, will be provided by Prometric to all test takers who choose to test at a testing center.
What if I don’t have all the equipment that I need, or a quiet and private room with a strong, stable internet connection to take the LSAT remotely?
LSAC understands that some candidates may not have access to a quiet or private room in which to take a remotely proctored test. Candidates may request to test in person at a designated testing center.
My desktop doesn’t have any built-in devices. Can I use external speakers or microphones?
Yes, if your computer does not have a built-in microphone or built-in speakers you are permitted to use external ones, provided that they are wired. Wireless external devices will not be permitted. Please note this only applies to desktop computers that do not have built-in devices.
Test Format and Test Sections
What is the LSAT like?
The LSAT is delivered in both an online, live remote-proctored environment and in person at a digital testing center
Starting with the August 2024 LSAT, the multiple-choice portion of the test consists of two scored Logical Reasoning sections and one scored Reading Comprehension section, plus one unscored section of either Logical Reasoning or Reading Comprehension that will enable us to validate new test questions for future use.
The LSAT includes a 10-minute intermission between the second and third sections. During the intermission, you can leave your testing area to have a snack or use the restroom. Possession of electronic devices, such as cell phones, is prohibited during the intermission and will result in the termination of your test. You will need to check in with your proctor before you can resume testing.
This is important. If you do not complete the recheck-in process with your proctor after the intermission is over, your test session will be terminated, and you will need to register for a new LSAT administration. You will not receive a refund.
Test takers who do not have a previous writing sample on file must also take LSAT Argumentative Writing, a proctored, on-demand writing exam that is administered online using secure proctoring software that is installed on the candidate’s own computer. Test takers will complete LSAT Argumentative Writing separately from the multiple-choice portion of the test, at a convenient time and place of their choosing. LSAT Argumentative Writing becomes available in candidates’ online accounts eight days prior to their test administration.
How long is the LSAT?
The LSAT is composed of four 35-minute test sections. There is a 10-minute intermission between the second and third sections. The test takes approximately 3 hours for standard test takers.
Is there a break during the test?
Yes, both the online, remotely proctored and in-person modalities of the LSAT include a 10-minute intermission between the second and third sections. During the 10-minute intermission, you can leave your testing area to have a snack or use the restroom. You must notify your proctor at the start of the intermission, before you leave the view of the camera.
You may not possess an electronic device, such as a cell phone during the intermission.
After the intermission, you will need to complete a recheck-in process with your proctor before you can resume testing.
This is important.
- If you do not complete the recheck-in process after the break is over, your test session will be terminated, and you will need to register for a new LSAT administration. You will not receive a refund.
- Working on test material, including scratch paper, during the intermission or while taking an unscheduled break to use the restroom, is strictly prohibited.
Unscheduled Restroom Breaks
If you need to take an unscheduled break to use the restroom at any other point during the test, you must notify your proctor prior to leaving your testing area. Please note that the clock will continue to run during the unscheduled break and while you rescan your room upon your return.
Additional Breaks for Accommodated Test Takers
LSAC understands that accommodated test takers often have a longer testing appointment and therefore may need additional breaks between sections of the test. Therefore, any test taker who has been approved for 100% additional time (or more) will be granted five-minute breaks between the other test sections upon request (i.e., after sections 1 and 3; in addition to the standard 10-minute intermission after section 2). Requests for these additional 5-minute breaks must be made by the published accommodation request deadline. Test takers can use these breaks to use the restroom even if the need for a restroom break is unrelated to the test taker’s disability.
In addition, breaks between test sections and stop/start breaks are available as accommodations on the LSAT, and can also be used for the purposes of using the restroom. Please take this into consideration when requesting testing accommodations.
Preparing for the LSAT
How can I prepare for the LSAT?
Both the online, live remote-proctored and in-person modalities of the LSAT are administered through LawHub™. To familiarize yourself with the content and interface of the LSAT, we recommend using the free Official LSAT Prep materials available through LawHub. Using these practice tests, you’ll be able to do everything you can do during the actual exam — eliminating and selecting responses, highlighting passages, setting screen preferences, and more.
If you’re taking the LSAT remotely, we encourage you to learn more about the technical requirements of the live, online remote-proctored and to test your equipment as soon as possible using Prometric’s System Readiness Check .
Test and Test-Taker Security
How does LSAC ensure the test is secure?
We know that the security, integrity, and validity of the LSAT are important to candidates and schools, so we take many steps to ensure the security of the LSAT.
All remote LSAT takers are monitored by live remote proctors via the camera and microphone in the test takers’ computers. The video and audio feeds are recorded in case further review is necessary.
Test takers who choose the in-person test center option will be monitored by on-site personnel.
Can Prometric get personal information from my computer?
No, Prometric cannot access your computer files without your knowledge.
What information about my LSAT experience am I allowed to share with others?
You may share general information, such as how you felt about the test-taking experience, the exam overall, or a section of the test. Sharing more details, such as information about a particular passage or a particular question and how you answered it, is prohibited.
Can I discuss details about the test, such as in a casual conversation?
No. The Candidate Agreement clearly states that sharing test details orally, in writing, on the internet, or through any other means or media is prohibited. This rule is necessary to ensure that the test remains fair for all test takers.
What is the penalty for sharing test details?
LSAC retains complete ownership rights to the LSAT and reserves the right to pursue all suitable courses of action to prevent fraudulent or unauthorized uses of its intellectual property and to prevent the compromise of secure test materials.
Taking the LSAT
What am I allowed to have with me during the LSAT?
Generally, your desktop must be clear of anything not test-related. The list of items permitted during the LSAT without prior approval from LSAC can be found in the LSAC Candidate Agreement. Section 13 covers items that are permitted at test centers, while Section 14 covers items that are permitted while testing remotely.
You are also permitted to bring any of the Preapproved Items listed on the Prometric website.
Please note that if you’re taking the test at a test center, a locker will be provided to you to safely store any items, other than those listed above, while you take your LSAT.
Can I have a beverage on my desk while I test?
Remote test takers are permitted to have a beverage in a clear/transparent container.
Candidates testing in a center are permitted to have water only, in a clear/transparent container with a lid or cap.
Note that all labels must be removed, and the container is subject to inspection.
What kind of identification do I need to take the LSAT?
Every test taker is required to present a physical, valid international passport or a physical, valid government-issued photo ID issued by the United States of America, U.S. Territories, or Canada. The ID must be current (or have expired within 3 months of your test date) and must contain:
- A recent and recognizable photo of you
- Your first name
- Your last name
- Your date of birth
The first and last name listed on your ID must exactly match the legal first and last name associated with your LSAC account. You can make changes to your legal name on the “Profile” page in your account. For more information, please visit Biographical Information Changes.
Please note that, by law, U.S. military IDs cannot be photographed and thus cannot be used for this purpose.
What if I don’t have my physical ID? Can I use a picture of it?
No. LSAC will only accept physical identification, regardless of whether you’re testing remotely or at a test center. Digital images, photocopies, etc., are not acceptable under any circumstances.
What behaviors are prohibited?
Adhering to the highest moral and ethical standards is essential for those in the legal profession. Every test taker is required to sign a Candidate Agreement each time they take the LSAT. Please make sure you read the entire Agreement; rushing through it or ignoring any of it could have serious adverse consequences.
Generally, during the test you may not:
- Communicate with anyone other than your proctor
- Read aloud (unless you have an approved testing accommodation)
- Allow your face to leave the webcam’s view (remote test takers)
- Leave your seat (except during the 10-minute intermission)
- Run any prohibited software applications
- Access any prohibited materials
- Connect or disconnect any external storage devices
- Behave in a noncompliant or abusive manner
- Disable your camera or audio capabilities at any time. This includes during the Intermission or any other scheduled/unscheduled breaks you may take. Your camera and audio must remain on at all times during your testing session.
After the test you may not:
- Share details of the test in an oral or written form, which includes sharing content on the internet or through any means or social media
- Copy, save, duplicate, or distribute any test material on your computer or any written notes you may have used during the test
The proctor’s instructions must be followed at all times. Any suspicious behavior noted by the proctor will be grounds for immediately ending the testing session. Terminated sessions are subject to score cancellation polices and to LSAC investigations that could lead to a finding of misconduct or irregularity. Any such finding may be shared with the law schools to which you apply.
What electronic devices are prohibited?
For remote test takers, one cell phone is allowed to be in your testing room, but it must be powered down and placed out of reach for the duration of the test.
In-person test takers will need to leave their powered-down cell phone in the locker assigned to them.
Additional cell phones are prohibited. You may not access the cell phone during the 10-minute intermission. Unauthorized access of an electronic device, such as a cell phone or tablet, will cause your testing session to be terminated (without a refund).
Devices that cannot be in the room during the LSAT include timers of any kind, watches of any kind, electronic cigarettes, fitness-tracking devices, beepers, pagers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), calculators, cameras, recording devices, listening devices (including, but not limited to, headphones, ear buds, air pods, and other electronic listening devices and/or noise-canceling devices other than generic foam ear plugs), headsets, and iPods and other media players. Please note that tablets, laptops, personal computers, or any other electronic device not being used to take the test are prohibited.
Prohibited electronic devices may not be in the room during the test because they cannot be monitored via your webcam feed. Please be aware that your proctor will not allow you to test if any prohibited electronics are noted during the room scan portion of your check-in. This includes any monitors or desktop computers that happen to be on the desk you may be resting your laptop on during the test. If your session is flagged for a violation during the test, your audio and video data may be referred to for an investigation by the Misconduct and Irregularities Subcommittee.
More information can be found at Misconduct & Irregularities and in the LSAC Candidate Agreement.
What other items are prohibited?
Test takers may not access briefcases, handbags, or backpacks of any kind. Head coverings of any kind (e.g., hats, hoods, bonnets, durags, scarves, etc.) may not be worn, unless the head covering is a religious requirement. Sunglasses or other eyewear with tinted lenses may not be worn. Books, printed materials, and any notes written before the start of the test may not be used, accessed, or referenced at any point during your session.
Other non-electronic prohibited items can remain in the room, but they must be put away and not accessed or referenced during the test.
What if I need headphones, earplugs, or earbuds to take the test?
Remote LSAT takers may use soft, non-electronic, non-corded/banded, generic foam ear plugs, which will need to be shown to and approved by your LSAT proctor. In-person LSAT takers will be assigned noise-reducing headphones as part of their equipment and materials.
This is important. Please ensure that your ear plugs will not interfere with your ability to receive instruction from your proctor. Test takers are responsible for adhering to proctor instructions and communications at all times.
In addition, unless a specified accommodation has been granted, remote test takers cannot wear headphones, earbuds, or anything similar that is not a soft, non-electronic, non-corded/banded, generic foam ear plug. These types of items are unable to be monitored by proctors to ensure a fair and equal testing environment. In-person test takers can only use the headphones assigned to them at the start of their test. LSAC’s goal is to safeguard your test and score by putting this policy in place to mitigate testing irregularities that could result in the termination of your session or cancellation of your score.
If I’m testing at a center, what kind of scratch paper am I provided?
Candidates who test in a center will be provided three (3) blank, unlined, colored scratch paper booklets. Each booklet contains two pages. You will also be provided two (2) pencils.
Candidates who test in a center are NOT permitted to bring their own scratch paper or writing instruments.
If I’m testing remotely, am I allowed to use scratch paper?
Yes, remote test takers are permitted to have six (6) blank sheets of 8.5”x11” scratch paper. The paper may be lined, unlined, or graphed. For more information, please review Section 14 of the LSAC Candidate Agreement.
Please note that scratch paper is not allowed for taking LSAT Argumentative Writing.
Can I use assistive technology programs while I take the LSAT?
The LSAT test-delivery software includes several built-in, user-adjustable tools, including a feature to increase text size incrementally and a line-spacing function. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the built-in features of the computer-based LSAT by utilizing the free Official LSAT Prep® practice tests available through LawHub.
Upon request, all LSAT takers (with or without test accommodations) are also permitted to use assistive technology programs to make web content accessible, such as keyboard-controlled screen reading software, screen magnification programs, or speech recognition software. To protect the security of test content, selectable text functionality (i.e., the ability to select text or place the cursor on the screen) is not available on any of LSAC’s products. Therefore, the computer-based LSAT is accessible with screen reader software programs that can be controlled and navigated using keystrokes and keyboard commands rather than text-to-speech software controlled and navigated using a mouse and cursor.
If you plan to use assistive technology programs during the LSAT, you must inform LSAC during registration and complete the Assistive Technology Form. This advance notice is required so that we can ensure you’ll have access to the software within the proctored environment. (The following programs are available upon request in our test centers: JAWS 2021 screen reader, ZoomText 2022 magnification, and Dragon Pro 15 speech recognition software. For remote testing, you will need to provide your own assistive technology programs. International test takers can only use assistive technology programs within our test centers.)
Contact LSAC for Questions and Support
If you have any questions about the accessibility of LSAC’s products, please contact accessibility@LSAC.org.
If you require additional accommodation to access the LSAT due to a disability, we encourage you to contact an LSAC Disability Customer Service Representative at accom@LSAC.org or 215.966.6625 (toll-free: 855.384.2253) for assistance. Any request for testing accommodations must be submitted by the applicable LSAT administration registration deadline. LSAC is committed to working with candidates to facilitate accessibility to the LSAT.
If testing remotely, where should I take the test?
Choose a quiet, well-lit, and private work area within a fully enclosed room with no transparent/glass walls or doors, where you can complete the test without interruption. A hard work surface, such as a desk or table, and a chair are required. It is very important to have a strong, stable internet connection to have a successful remote-testing experience. Ensure that your workspace is clean and clear of all prohibited items. Your entire face must be clearly visible throughout the test. Once you begin testing, do not move out of view of the webcam or change working environments until the test is over.
What should I wear during my remote testing session?
Your testing session will be proctored live, and video of your session will later be reviewed by LSAC personnel. Please dress as if you were taking the test in person at a physical testing center. Please note that lighter clothing items such as sweaters, suit jackets, scarves, etc., should be hung on the back of your chair if removed. Outerwear such as heavy coats, parkas, etc., and items that may obscure your face from the proctor’s view, such as head coverings (with the exception of religious apparel), sunglasses, and headphones, may not be worn.
When can I eat during the LSAT?
Test takers are only permitted to access food during an authorized break such as the 10-minute intermission. No food is permitted on the desktop during the administration of the test, unless you have an approved disability-related testing accommodation. If you are testing in a center, you will be required to store any food in the locker that is assigned to you, unless you have an approved accommodation to keep food at your workstation.
Will I be able to take breaks during the test?
Yes, both the online, live remote-proctored and in-person modalities of the LSAT include a 10-minute intermission between the second and third sections. During the 10-minute intermission, you can leave your testing area to have a snack or use the restroom. Should you need to use the restroom at any other time during the test, you must notify your proctor and wait for permission. You may not possess a cell phone during the intermission or any unscheduled break. You will need to check in with your proctor before you can resume testing.
This is important.
- If you do not complete the recheck-in process after the break is over, your test session may be terminated, and you will need to register for a new LSAT administration. You will not receive a refund.
- Anytime you leave the testing environment your camera must remain on and untouched. If you turn the camera off or obstruct it from monitoring your testing environment, your test session may be terminated, and you will need to register for a new LSAT administration. You will not receive a refund.
Additional Breaks for Accommodated Test Takers
LSAC understands that accommodated test takers often have a longer testing appointment and therefore may need additional breaks between sections of the test. Therefore, any test taker who has been approved for 100% additional time (or more) will be granted five-minute breaks between the other test sections upon request (i.e., after sections 1 and 3; in addition to the standard 10-minute intermission after section 2). Requests for these additional 5-minute breaks must be made by the published accommodation request deadline. Test takers can use these breaks to use the restroom even if the need for a restroom break is unrelated to the test taker’s disability. Candidates can still request other break(s) as accommodations on the LSAT and are not limited to five-minute breaks between sections.
In addition, breaks between test sections and stop/start breaks are available as accommodations on the LSAT, and can also be used for the purposes of using the restroom. Please take this into consideration when requesting testing accommodations.
If I’m testing remotely, what happens if I lose my internet connection, or have other technical difficulties?
In most cases, the remote proctoring system will save your progress and pause the test while the technical issue is resolved. Once the issue is resolved and you restart the test, the system will allow you to resume where you left off.
If your connection is interrupted during the test, you will be required to complete the security check-in process again before resuming. The proctor will exercise discretion in determining whether to allow you to resume your testing session more than once should you continue to experience connectivity issues. If you are unable to restore your connection during your scheduled testing window, your testing session will be terminated, and you will be moved to a future registration date.
What if someone else enters the room while I am taking the test?
If someone else enters the room, you must ask them to leave immediately. At the proctor’s discretion, you may continue testing once the person leaves the room. Your testing session will be flagged for further review. You will not be penalized if the interaction is brief and it is evident that no information about the test was communicated.
What if my pet enters the room while I’m taking the test?
If a pet wanders into the room while you’re testing, you may continue to test. Your face must be clearly visible throughout the test, and once you begin, you cannot move out of view of the webcam until the test is over.
Do I need to take LSAT Argumentative Writing? When can I do that, and how?
Yes, LSAT Argumentative Writing is required and is included in your test registration fee. If you do not already have a completed writing sample on file from a previous test, you must complete LSAT Argumentative Writing before your score can be released. To help meet this requirement, LSAT Argumentative Writing now becomes available in test takers’ LSAC online accounts eight days prior to each test administration. We strongly recommend you complete LSAT Argumentative Writing at the earliest possible time so that your score can be released on time.
In case you are not applying in the current cycle, please note you have a maximum of one (1) year to take LSAT Argumentative Writing.
LSAT Scores and Law School Admission
When will I get my LSAT score?
Score release dates are listed for each LSAT administration. Your score will be released on the date listed so long as you have an approved writing sample on file and there are no holds on your account.
If you are a first-time test taker, you must complete LSAT Argumentative Writing, and have it approved, before your score can be released. To help meet this requirement, LSAT Argumentative Writing is available in test takers’ LSAC accounts eight days prior to each test administration. Your writing sample must be processed and approved before it can be added to your LSAC file. Please note that processing can take up to three weeks from the date you complete LSAT Argumentative Writing, depending on volume and any flagged issues. We strongly recommend you complete LSAT Argumentative Writing as early as it becomes available for your test administration so that your score can be released on time.
If you previously took LSAT Writing during the current reportable score period (i.e., as early as June 2020), your previous writing sample is still valid, and you do not need to complete LSAT Argumentative Writing.
Will I be able to complete my LSAT Argumentative Writing at a test center?
No. You can only complete the multiple-choice part of the LSAT at a test center. LSAT Argumentative Writing will remain in an on-demand, remotely proctored format available 24/7, 365 days a year.
How will my scores be reported?
Scores are released to test takers at 9 a.m. ET on the designated score release date for any given administration via the test taker’s LSAC JD Account. Your score will only be released if you have an approved LSAT Argumentative Writing sample on file and there are no holds on your account. If you are a first-time test taker, you must complete LSAT Argumentative Writing before your score can be released.
Your score will be released to the schools to which you have applied at the same time it is released to you, unless you have purchased the LSAT Score Preview option. If you purchased Score Preview, your score will be released to law schools only after you have chosen to have it released, or at the end of the Score Preview period if you have not canceled the score.
Can I cancel my LSAT score before scores are released?
Yes. Should you decide to cancel your LSAT score, you must do so within six (6) calendar days of your test date. You can cancel your score through your LSAC JD Account or by contacting LSAC directly at LSACinfo@LSAC.org or 1.800.336.3982. Please note that this six-day deadline does not apply for test takers who have signed up for LSAT Score Preview.
How do I sign up for LSAT Score Preview?
LSAT Score Preview is available to test takers who wish to see their score before deciding whether to keep it as part of their LSAC transcript and report it to schools. For the 2024-2025 testing year, Score Preview will cost $45 if you purchase it prior to the first day of testing for a given test administration, or $85 if you purchase it after testing has concluded.
Test takers who purchase Score Preview will receive their scores at the same time as other test takers (assuming they have an approved LSAT Argumentative Writing sample on file and have no holds on their accounts), and will have six (6) calendar days from the date their score is released to decide if they want to cancel or keep their score. If they take no action, their scores will be added to their LSAC transcript and released to schools at the end of the six-day period.
Score Preview is available for purchase through your LSAC JD Account.
How long should I keep records?
Because some state bar associations inquire about the law school admission records of those seeking admission to the bar, you should maintain complete copies of all law school application records throughout the admission cycle and your law school career.
Any LSAT scores you have earned after June 2020 are available to view and print from within your LSAC online account. For a copy of scores received prior to June 2020, you can contact LSAC to order an Official Candidate LSAT Score Report.
How can I inquire about a test question?
If while taking the LSAT, you find what you believe to be an error or ambiguity in a test question that affects your response to that specific question, report it to the test proctor as soon as you finish the test and email LSATTS@LSAC.org immediately.
LSAC will respond to all reasonable inquiries about test questions received within 10 days after the candidate’s LSAT test date. Your inquiry should include your name, your LSAC account number, question type (Logical Reasoning or Reading Comprehension), and any identifying information you can recall such as the section in which the question appeared, the number of the question, or key words in the question. LSAT Test Developers will review your inquiry and send a written response.
How will schools use my LSAT score?
Law schools use LSAT scores as one component of a holistic admission process that considers many factors related to each candidate. These schools have a long history of using the LSAT appropriately and know how to use the test and other predictors in their processes.
Are there other tests available for law school admission?
Some law schools in the U.S. and Canada accept other tests for the purposes of admission. However, the LSAT is the only test accepted by all law schools, and the only test designed specifically for law school admission. Other tests are designed for different purposes and test different skills. The best way to assess your ability to succeed in law school is to take the LSAT.
What effect does the LSAT have on law school composition?
Properly used as part of well-developed holistic review admission practices, law schools can effectively consider many distinct applicant qualities and life experiences when advancing their mission. The LSAT enables schools to identify highly qualified candidates who might otherwise be overlooked on the basis of undergraduate institution, GPA, lack of access to extracurricular activities, or other factors.
How does LSAC ensure the LSAT is measuring the right skills?
LSAC periodically conducts skills analysis studies to ensure the LSAT is focused on the right skills. Law school faculty members who participate in these studies consistently rate all the skills assessed by the LSAT as those most essential to success in law school and legal practice. LSAC also uses reports from the Association of American Law Schools (AALS) and the American Bar Association (ABA), along with focus groups of students and law school faculty, to ensure the LSAT assesses the most relevant skills.
How does LSAC ensure that the test is fair?
Every LSAT question is subjected to rigorous external expert review and field testing to ensure it is free from any form of bias and fair to every group of test takers; any question that shows any racial, ethnic, or gender bias in field testing is rejected and never used in actual scored testing. Additionally, LSAC believes standardized assessments should be only one important component in a holistic admission process. Properly used, the LSAT can be a tool for enhancing diversity, providing opportunity for individuals from different backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and identities, including but not limited to, race, ethnicity, creed, color, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, level of educational attainment, language, culture, family history, age, national origin, religion/spirituality, (dis)ability, and military/veteran status. The LSAT provides a way for every student to demonstrate their skills, regardless of what undergraduate institution they attended or other forms of privilege.
