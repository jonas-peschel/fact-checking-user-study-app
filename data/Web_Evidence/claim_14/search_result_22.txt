In the Senate, the first three steps in passing a bill (introduction, numbered by Chief Clerk, and passes first consideration) are the same for local bills as for general bills. On second consideration, however, procedure changes and the bill is passed on second consideration and held on the Clerk's desk. Since local bills only affect one "locality," they need not be referred to a standing committee but, must meet the approval of the local legislative delegation. The Speaker may refer a local bill to committee in which case it follows the normal steps in the committee system.
After a local bill receives the signature of each member of the local delegation affected by the legislation, it is placed on the Consent Calendar
From the Engrossing process on, the procedure for local bills is the same as for general bills. These bills do not amend the code but, instead become part of the Private Acts of a particular year.
In the House, the steps in passing local bills are the same as for passing general bills.
The following represents the normal steps in adopting resolutions:
Resolutions differ from bills in that they do not become law but simply serve to express the views of the majority of one or both houses of the Legislature.
Resolutions adopted in only one house are known as House or Senate Resolutions, depending on the house in which adopted or introduced. Resolutions adopted by both the Senate and the House are called Joint Resolutions. If they originate in the Senate, they are called Senate Joint Resolutions; and if in the House, they are referred to as House Joint Resolutions.
In the Senate, all memorializing resolutions are referred to the Calendar Committee; and all other resolutions, except joint resolutions proposing joint conventions, are referred to standing committees.
In the House, all resolutions except congratulatory or memorializing resolutions are referred to standing committees, while congratulatory and memorializing resolutions are placed on the Consent Calendar. All joint resolutions in either house calling for a joint convention of both houses are referred to a committee consisting of the Speaker, the majority leader, and the minority leader.
No resolution, except one proposing an amendment to the Constitution, is required to be read three times. However, according to Article III, Section 18 of the Tennessee Constitution, all joint resolutions, except those calling for adjournment of the Legislature and those proposing specific amendments to the Constitution, must be submitted to the Governor for his signature. The Governor may veto a resolution, just as he may veto a bill; and the General Assembly may override the veto of a resolution in the same manner it may override the veto of a bill.
