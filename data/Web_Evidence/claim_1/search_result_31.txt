President Trump’s Federal Budget committed to restraint while prioritizing the funding needed to rebuild our national defense and strengthen America’s borders.
Under President Trump, Congress passed the first overhaul of the United States tax code in more than 30 years, putting money into the pockets of millions of American families. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included the launch of “Opportunity Zones,” which bring hope and a brighter future to nearly 9,000 distressed communities with tax incentives for new development.
In 2019 alone, the Trump Administration surpassed its promise of removing two existing regulations for each new regulation added, issuing 150 deregulatory actions alongside just 35 new significant regulatory actions. This deregulatory wave unleashed massive benefits for the American people and our economy.
