As was expected, the much awaited Common Law Admission Test – CLAT 2020 – has been postponed due to the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. This law entrance exam, which was scheduled to be held on May 10, 2020 has now been rescheduled on May 24, 2020 as a precautionary measure. The exam will thus be held on Sunday, May 24, 2020 from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm. The last date to submit the application form – viz. CLAT 2020 Registration – has also been extended from March 31 to April 25, 2020.
Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) is one of the most awaited law entrance tests in India. The exam is conducted to allow admission to students in LLB and LLM programs offered by 21 NLUs, 53 private colleges and other participating colleges. Students who aspire to get admission in the prominent law institutes of the nation are advised to go through CLAT 2020 syllabus and pattern carefully.
The conducting body of this year’s CLAT exam – namely, NUSRL, Ranchi – has released a notification containing the new schedule of CLAT 2020 Exam. The notification also provided the helpline number and makes it clear that it will remain active between 10:00 am to 5:00 pm on all working days.
Here it is important to note that the Consortium has also changed the CLAT 2020 Exam Pattern. The total questions have been reduced from 200 to 150. The revised CLAT 2020 Syllabus will contain questions on English Language, Current Affairs including General Knowledge, Legal Reasoning, Logical Reasoning, and Quantitative Techniques.
The CLAT scores are acceptable in all law colleges of India. However, the intake capacity of the NLU’s are comparitively less than the numebr of applicants. While in some colleges, the degree provided is a 5-year B.A.LL.B. program, in some it is LLB integrated with BBA. Although the consortium organizes CLAT every year, there are other good colleges who conduct their separate law entrance test for selecting students for admission.
