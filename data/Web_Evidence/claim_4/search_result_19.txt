Death under the Spotlight: The Data
This series of tabulations supports my article, “Death under the Spotlight: The Manuel Velazquez Boxing Fatality Collection.” If your search engine brought you here directly, please refer to the main article itself, located at http://ejmas.com/jcs/jcsart_svinth_a_0700.htm, for background and statistical analysis.
You are welcome to print these tables for private use, but please be aware that a printed version of the complete document may run more than a hundred pages in length. Check formatting, too – you will want landscape rather than portrait.
Names may be misspelled, or the date may reflect the date of death rather than the date of the fatal event. If you find errors, have photographs or additional information to share, or simply want a copy of the most current Excel spreadsheet, please contact me at jsvinth@ejmas.com.
Deaths are sorted by type (professional, amateur, Toughman, training, or before 1890), and then by year. To search alphabetically, use the CTRL-F search function of your browser.
SURVIVOR: When known, birth names appear first, followed by ring name in parentheses (like this).
DAY/MO/YEAR: These fields show the date of the fatal event.
RES: The result of the fight. Although the default is knockout (KO), the actual outcome may have been different unless a round (RD) is also listed.
DECEASED: When known, birth names appear first, followed by ring name in parentheses (like this).
AGE: This refers to the age of the deceased.
COUNTY/STATE: This column lists English counties, US and Australian states, and Canadian provinces.

Charles John Palmer, The Perlustration of Great Yarmouth,with Goreston and Southtown, (Great Yarmouth: George Nall, 1872), 89. This probably is not the first boxing death in England. For example, a John Smith reportedly died of blows in 1730 and in July 1736, the Northampton Mercury reported two anonymous deaths due to blows. In those days, the English associated boxing with butchers' guilds and Maisters of Defence, and contests often took place at fairs. |

Grant, 1906), 23; Bob Mee, Bare Fists: The History of Bare-Knuckle Prize Fighting (Woodstock, New York: Overlook Press, 2001), 13-17. The fight probably took place at Broughton's booth in Hanway Street. The bout lasted about 35-40 minutes, and it ended with Broughton pinning Stevenson against a ring stake and then hitting him hard above the heart. The blows broke several ribs, and Stevenson died of injuries the following month. The death is commemorated in Paul Whitehead's mock-heroic poem entitled The Gymnasiad, or Boxing Match. "Down dropp'd the Hero [Stevenson], welt'ring in his Gore," said Whitehead, "And his stretch'd Limbs lay quiv'ring on the Floor." Stevenson's death also directly contributed to the introduction of Broughton's Rules in 1743, which became one of the fundamental bases of modern international boxing. Summarized, Broughton's Rules prohibited hitting below the waist or after the opponent was down, introduced rounds and rest periods, and designated the starting mark as "a square of a yard chalked in the middle of a stage." Broughton also introduced "mufflers," meaning leather gloves padded with several ounces of horsehair or lamb's wool, to pugilism. Here, the motivation was Broughton's establishment of a boxing school for wealthy amateurs. (An advertisement in the Daily Advertiser for February 1, 1747 claimed that gloves would "effectually secure [students] from the inconveniency of black eyes, broken jaws, and bloody noses.") Weight classes also developed during this period. This innovation came from cockfighting and horseracing, and was intended to simplify the problems of setting odds for fights between men of mismatched size and weight. |

Swaine was a blacksmith who challenged Ward, a professional, to a fight, for a prize of a guinea. Swaine took Ward by the hair, and began punching him in the face. They then went to the ground, and the first round ended. They got back up, and Ward began striking back. Swaine said he wanted to stop, and began walking away. Ward followed Swaine, and struck him again, once in the stomach and a second time to the head. Swaine went down, and was dead on the spot. The surgeon did not do an autopsy, but said that the cause of death was a blow to the temple. Ward was arrested, convicted of manslaughter, and sentenced to three months imprisonment, plus a one-shilling fine. An artist's depiction of the mill appears in Andrew Knapp and William Baldwin, The Newgate Calendar, vol. 3 (London: J. Robins and Co., 1825), 145. |

Henry Downes Miles, Pugilistica: The History of British Boxing (London, J. Grant, 1906), 17. Cause of death was attributed to congestion of the brain. Around this time, pugilism began falling out of favor with the British aristocracy. One reason was a scandal over betting that caused the retirement of Gentleman John Jackson, a man widely viewed as an honest broker. Another was the well-publicized trial and execution of a homicidal boxing promoter named John Thurtell. And a third was the spread of middle-class Christian evangelicalism. To the Christian reformers, pugilism gave crude pleasure to the rich and the working classes. Moreover, it was associated with homoeroticism, which was an even graver sin. (During the Regency, heroic nudity had been an artistic vogue, and Thomas Bruce, Earl of Elgin, was notorious for paying pugilists to pose nude amidst his Greek marbles.) Thus, new laws were passed -- and more importantly, enforced. The first major fight to be stopped under the new anti-prizefight laws was one between Ned Neale and Jem Burns in 1824. Going to America was one of the ways that fighters avoided such strictures, and in July 1823, the New York Evening Post described a bout between an 18-year old butcher and "a man they called the champion of Hickory Street." The stakes in the latter fight were $200, an amount roughly equal to a working man’s annual income. Better known were the battles between Ned Hammond of Dublin and George Kensett of Liverpool in 1824 and 1826. Such battles had strong ethnic overtones, and the practice of tying gang colors to the ropes dates to this era. At the same time, journalists such as Pierce Egan, author of Boxiana, or Sketches of Ancient and Modern Pugilism, began promoting the heroics of the old days, and newspapers such as the New York Herald began routinely reporting prizefights. Other, less famous, popular boxing texts of 1820s and 1830s included William Sharples's The Complete Art of Boxing (1829), Samuel O’Rourke’s The Art of Pugilism (1837), and Owen Swift’s Hand-Book to Boxing (1840). The American edition of the latter book was called Boxing without a Master. |

Cooper was the fifth son of the Earl of Shaftsbury. Meanwhile, Wood, who was aged about 16 years, was the son of an army colonel and the nephew of Charles Stewart, 3rd Marquis of Londonderry. Wood and Cooper had an argument about seating, and they agreed to settle it using prize ring rules. After boxing for about two hours, Cooper was knocked down by a blow to the temple, and he did not get up. His friend James Morrell carried him to his bed. A servant looked in on him every hour, and after about four hours, the surgeon was called. By the time the doctor arrived, Cooper was dead. The coroner's jury found for manslaughter. The criminal case was tried March 9, 1825. Cooper's family refused to allow his brothers, who had served as his seconds in the match, to testify against Wood. Consequently, since there were no witnesses to the contrary, a verdict of not guilty was returned. |

McKay was a strongman rather than a pugilist, and despite the billing that this was a championship bout, it was only McKay's fourth prizefight. (He had two wins over an Irish boxer, Paul Spencer, and a loss to Simon Byrne 2-1/2 years earlier.) The blow that ended the fight was a left to the throat that didn't seem to anyone to be that powerful. Nonetheless, McKay was carried to his corner. When he regained consciousness, he complained of severe headache. The surgeon bled him and gave him laudanum, but he died nonetheless. Cause of death was listed as "considerable effusion of blood, three or four tablespoons full," on the left side of the brain. In other words, he had an acute left subdural hematoma. At the subsequent manslaughter trial, witnesses were found to say that McKay had struck his head while falling on some stones several hours before the fight, and so no convictions were obtained. |

Garland, American and English Encyclopaedia of Law, Vol. 28 (Northport, New York: Edward Thompson Co., 1895), 203. The fight started at Islington (then part of Middlesex), but the police interfered. The fighters then moved to the Isle of Dogs (Kent), where they resumed the mill. Dodd lost, and and he died soon after in hospital. The court's ruling was that if the fatal blow occurred in one county, but death occurred in another, then the county in which the blow was struck had jurisdiction. Hargrave was convicted, and sentenced to fourteen years' transportation. |

Grant, 1906), 126; John Gilbert Bohun Lynch, Knuckles and Gloves (London: W. Collins Sons, 1922), 80-83. Byrne had gained a lot of weight over the past few years, so during his training for this fight, he lost about 25 pounds. By the 43rd round, both men were clearly exhausted, but the seconds and the referee kept pushing them to their marks, as they had their bets to consider. Finally, by the 99th round, Byrne's hands were too damaged to go on, and the fight was stopped. Two days later, Byrne died. The official cause of death was congestion of blood on the left side of the brain. The scandal surrounding the seconds pushing exhausted fighters to their mark contributed to the development of London Prize Ring Rules, which, among other things, prohibited seconds from carrying a nearly unconscious man to the mark. Meanwhile, although Burke avoided prison, he was unable to get another fight in England. Therefore, in 1836, he went to the USA, where he fought in both New York and New Orleans |

Thompson died of concussion of the brain, but his being bled of four pints (two liters) of blood probably didn't help. A faction fight, complete with bludgeons, had broken out during the middle of the bout, and this led to Murphy and his seconds being charged with death during riotous assembly. The case law is R. v. Murphy, 6 C&P 103. Murphy was sent to prison, where he soon died, but the true importance of this case is that in it, the court determined that seconds could be charged with aiding and abetting manslaughter. |

Gaudry threw Bishop several times, and finally Bishop stayed down. The surgeon bled Bishop, and then he was taken to a nearby pub, where he died. Cause of death was listed as compression of the brain, occasioned by a profusion of blood on the brain. The mechanism was attributed to the falls rather than the blows. The survivor, seconds, and bottle holders were convicted of prizefighting, and sentenced to prison sentences ranging from three months to two years. |

The fight was well-planned (it took place at the border of three counties, but on a main road), lasted about 1-1/2 hours, and throughout, no one called "shame." Phelps collapsed after the fight. Cause of death was given as brain hemorrhage, primarily on the left side, and a punctured left lung. Swift was charged with manslaughter, but acquitted. Nonetheless, the scandal following this death led to the Pugilistic Club of London replacing Broughton's Rules with London Prize Ring Rules. The new rules introduced a 24-foot square roped ring, eliminated seizing below the waist, and prohibited seconds from pushing a a semi-conscious fighter to his mark. |

McCoy's corner would not throw in the towel and he ended up literally drowning in his own blood. Lilly went to England to avoid prosecution, but 18 others were arrested and convicted of fourth-degree manslaughter. Lilly later returned to the USA via New Orleans, and during the early 1850s, he was promoting boxing and cockfighting in San Francisco. In August 1856, a vigilance committee suggested that Lilly leave California for his health. So, he went to Honduras, where he was executed in February 1857. NOTE: This is not the first US ring fatality. For example, according to Plattsburgh (New York) Republican, December 6, 1817, cited at http://esf.uvm.edu/vtbox/Historical.html, "A young man was killed the other day in New York (City), in a boxing match." There is also indication of a death in New Orleans in 1834. However, there is no additional documentation, so these deaths are not listed here. |

Janesville (Wisconsin) Gazette, October 4, 1856; Viroqua (Wisconsin) Western Times, October 11, 1856. Kelly was carried unconscious to the hospital, where he died. Around this same time, an anonymous notice in London's Saturday Review coined the phrase "Muscular Christianity." The phrase described the philosophy that a perfect Christian gentleman should fear God, play sports, and doctor a horse with equal facility. ("The object of education," said an editorial in Spirit of the Times, "is to make men out of boys. Real live men, not bookworms, not smart fellows, but manly fellows.") This in turn began changing the interpretation of the English word "sport," which previously had referred mostly to betting on boxing matches and horse races. |

The fight was with gloves. Because prizefighting was illegal, the match was advertised as a "protracted sparring match." The two men fought for about an hour. In the end, Young was knocked down. He struck his head against a ring post. He said did not feel well, and his second stopped the fight. Young went to the hospital, where he died five hours later. Cause of death was a rupture of an artery on the right side of the brain. The subsequent court case, R. v. Young, (1866) 10 Cox 371, established the legal precedent that death "caused by an injury received in a friendly sparring match, which is not a thing likely to cause death... is not manslaughter, unless the parties fight on until the sport becomes dangerous." (Henry Roscoe, Roscoe's Digest of the Law of Evidence in Criminal Cases, Eighth American Edition, volume II, Philadelphia, 1888, p. 912.) Another important distinction of this fight is that it took place in private rooms, and so did not cause a public nuisance. There had been cases of fence-breaking and illegal timber removal in earlier outdoor prizefights, and after 1860, most British railway companies refused to hire special trains for prizefight excursions. Indeed, the practice of hiring special prizefight trains was specifically prohibited by the Regulation of Railways Act of 1868: "Any railway company that shall knowingly let for hire any special train for the purpose of conveying parties to be present at any prize fight... shall be liable to a penalty ... of such sum not exceeding five hundred pounds, and not less than two hundred pounds."

There were no convictions, and Fox's future billets included Inspector of Army Physical Training (1890-1897). As inspetor of training, Fox wrote rules for Army and amateur boxing that were widely influential in the late Victorian and Edwardian periods. One of Fox's rules was that knockouts did not count any more than any other clean blow. (One lost by not coming up for time, but not by the knockout per se.) The idea was to reduce the boxers' incentive to try for knockout punches.

Boston Daily Globe, December 29, 1876; New York Times, December 31, 1876. The men were professionals, and fighting with "the ordinary stuffed boxing-gloves with which it is impossible to inflict serious injury." There was no referee, but there was a time-keeper. Witnesses included several police officers in uniform. Davidson quit from exhaustion, and died about an hour later. Although both men were carried to their marks for the last couple of rounds, "neither man was bruised to any extent" (New York Times), and death was attributed to cardiac trouble. |

Two-ounce gloves were worn, and it was a finish fight fought according to Queensberry Rules. Dempsey was hit in the temple. He collapsed, and did not get up. The promoter said he didn't know the names of anyone who was there, and the seconds said that death was due either to the fall or to Dempsey being unfit for boxing. Besser was about 18, and he remained a professional boxer for several years. Besser's wife Minnie also boxed professionally (Chicago Daily Tribune, November 2, 1892). |

Although a one-round knockout, remember that under London Prize Ring Rules, rounds lasted until there was a knockdown or fall. Anyway, Bannon reportedly held Fulljames' hand, and then struck him repeatedly in the temple. However, the coroner's inquest ruled that it was a slung shot that struck Fulljames in the temple, causing his death, rather than a blow from a fist. Either way, the bettors didn't want Fulljames winning. As for Bannon, he was murdered about a week later. See Salem (Ohio) Daily News, April 22, 1889 and Brooklyn Daily Eagle, April 20, 1889. |

Two-ounce gloves were worn, and the fight started at midnight. Within the first couple rounds, both the boxers and the ring floor were slick with blood. At the start of the twelfth, Jackson stood up, then fell backwards, and the fight was stopped. After Jackson died, Herron and the seconds were arrested on charges of murder in the second degree. Herron told the police that Jackson must have had heart disease, because he had not been hit hard enough to cause death. Newspaper coverage of this bout was extensive, in part because the referee, Joe Murphy, was the former sporting editor of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. |

Proponents included Dr. Philip O'Hanlon of the New York Coroner's office. "Post-mortem examinations on bodies of small boys have impressed upon Dr. O'Hanlon... the great lack of chest development these lads must have had in life. As the best means of safely attaining lung development in the physically formative years, he urges the effectiveness of boxing, properly conducted. He mentions President Roosevelt as an example of the efficacy of the 'manly sport' in chest building" (Syracuse, New York, Herald, January 25, 1909). |

Branham was a soldier stationed at the Army's Nike missile site HA-36, which was located near Portland, Connecticut. Wilson, who was 23 at the time of Branham's death, was a professional boxer whose eventual career record of 20-43-0 suggests that during the rest of his boxing career, he was brought in mostly to build younger fighters' knockout records. This is almost certainly the case at the end of his career, because his last two fights, in 1971 and 1972, were against George Foreman and Jimmy Ellis. |

Bantam (8 stone 6) |
London Times, February 10, 1890; (Glasgow) Scotsman, February 10, 1890. Williams was a member of the Stanhope Amateur Athletic Club, and 8-ounce gloves were being worn. During this fight, Williams was hit repeatedly, but according to the papers, not especially hard. In any case, he stepped back, and then collapsed unconscious. He was rubbed down with vinegar and left to wake up on his own. After about an hour, he still was not conscious. Consequently, he was wrapped in blankets and taken to the hospital, where he died several hours later. Cause of death was due to the rupture of small blood vessels in the brain. Williams had been knocked unconscious during December 1899. |

Fort Wayne (Indiana) Sentinel, August 16, 1905; Van Wert (Ohio) Daily Bulletin, August 16, 1905; Galveston (Texas) Daily News, August 19, 1905; Letter dated July 15, 1905, from sailor Frank Hoster of USS Olympia to his mother, advertised on E-bay on October 20, 2005. Cohen was a coal passer from USS Yankee, while Johnson was a coal passer on USS Olympia. Cohen died in sick bay early the next morning. Cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage on the left side of the brain. The following passage comes from Hoster’s letter: “We have been holding prize fights aboard this Ship but I don’t think we will have any more on account of one of the Yankee’s crew getting killed. The fellows name was Cohen and lived near the Bowery in New York City. The fight was for a knock out and winner take all the money. The lad who killed him is a negro and is one of this ship’s crew. The fight was about even untill the eighth round when Johnson the negro gave him a left-swing and sent him to the mat and just about the finishing of the count Cohen got on his feet and Johnson caught him another with his right and knocked him to the mat never to rise any more. He was carried to the sick bay and died at 12 O’clock that night. We are making a purse for his Mother and have got about One Thousand Dollars so far. Johnson is getting a General Court Martial but it will not amount to anything.” Hoster was correct about the court-martial, whose verdict was that Cohen died in line of duty. According to the Daily News article, “There is hardly a ship in the navy with a sufficiently large crew which does not witness two or three of these bouts each week... They are usually held on the forward deck, and the commissioned officers, if they are present, are there more as tacitly invited guests than in any other capacity.” |

Toronto Globe, March 30, 1906; Toronto Globe, April 4, 1906. Wyer had just arrived in Canada from England, and had never boxed in a tournament before. Although he weighed about 105 pounds, he was fighting in the bantamweight division. He collapsed in the dressing room after the fight. An ambulance came to take him to the hospital, but because the injury occurred during the first bout of the night, few people in the audience were aware of it. Wyer died in hospital about four hours later. Autopsy revealed no brain injury, so the coroner’s jury ruled cause of death to be apoplexy caused by excitement. |

The match was sanctioned (and supervised) by school officials, for the purpose of resolving a grudge; evidently, Lewis, aged 16, had called the older youth “Pussy” Katz. Katz was larger, and did well enough during the first two rounds that Lewis wanted to stop at the end of the second. However, Katz wanted to continue, so the match was allowed to continue into the third round specified for amateur bouts. At the start of the third, before any blows were struck, Katz suddenly fell to the ground. He was pronounced dead 12 minutes later. Cause of death was attributed to acute dilation of the right ventricle of the heart. |

Ancestry.com. World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918 [database on-line]; McAdams v. Windham, 208. Ala. 492. The two men were sparring bare-knuckle, as they had often done in the past. McAdams was struck hard over the heart. He staggered back, and was caught by a spectator, a man named Waltrop. He was then laid on the floor, where he died within minutes. Cause of death was ruled to be the blow over the heart. The widow charged the survivor with assault, and the case ended up in the state supreme court. The case is McAdams v. Windham, 208 Ala. 492, 94 So. 742, 30 A.L.R. 194, Nov. 30, 1922. In its finding on behalf of Windham, the Alabama Supreme Court noted that “it is a general rule of law that a blow thus inflicted in a friendly, mutual combat -- a mere sporting contest -- is not unlawfully inflicted.” Instead, so long as no one was guilty of reckless or negligent conduct, “participants in a violent game have assumed the risk ordinarily incident to their sport.” |

After the fight, during which there were no knockdowns or visibly hard blows, Millsaps walked to the dressing room, where he collapsed. He died the following morning without ever regaining consciousness. Cause of death was a ruptured artery on the left side of his brain. Millsaps had a history of basal skull fracture, in 1921. Said the student paper: “According to Dr. [D.H.] Moulton it would take considerable time for the blood from this small artery to ooze out enough blood to press against the brain and cause death. He stated that there was little or no chance that the artery was ruptured in football but stated that there was a chance of such a thing happening in almost any sport activity.” |

New York Times, March 19, 1948; New York Times, March 20, 1948. Iacona collapsed in the ring during a bout held in the gym of Public School 29 in Brooklyn. The contests were informal, and consisted of three two-minute rounds, with 1-1/2 minute rest periods. Sixteen ounce gloves were worn. Cause of death was attributed to meningitis and thymico-lymphaticus. (The latter is medical jargon that is no longer used, but in those days, it referred to an unexplained death in a youth with an enlarged thymus.) Iacona’s parents took the case to court, arguing that the city was negligent because no physical examinations were required and that no training had been provided. The jury found for the parents, but in 1955, when the case finally reached the appeals court, the court ruled that the city was not “under a duty to examine physically every participant in an athletic activity.” The case law is Iacona v. Board of Education of City of New York, 285 A.D. 1168, 140 N.Y.S. 2d 539. |

In the course of his bout with another person, likewise a non-professional, of the same height, weight, and size, Eduardo slipped and was hit by his opponent on the left part of the back of the head, causing Eduardo to fall, with his head hitting the rope of the ring. He was brought to the Baguio General Hospital the following day. The cause of death was reported as hemorrhage, intracranial, left.” As in Gustafson v. New York Life, the court ruled that unless boxing was specifically excluded from coverage, survivors of deceased boxers were entitled to life insurance benefits. |

Doylestown (Pennsylvania) Intelligencer, March 27, 1989; Washington Post, March 27, 1989; Syracuse (New York) Post-Standard, March 29, 1989. Williams suffered a stroke after fighting twice in one day. NOTE: This is a possible PFO death, because in people under age 50, patent foramen ovale, PFO is the cause of 25-50% of all strokes. PFO is the name given to a small hole in the heart that everyone has at birth, and that usually closes up within a few years. If it does not close up, it usually causes no problems. However, in rare instances, PFO can allow small clots to pass through, and these clots can in turn lead to strokes. Although symptoms of PFO include blurred vision and flashes of light, the condition cannot be diagnosed without special tests. |

Although gloves were worn, the bout took place in at an unsanctioned, unsupervised “fight club” that had been operating for several years. Pitner collapsed following his third three-round bout of the afternoon. Paramedics were called around 4:00 p.m., and Pitner died in hospital at about 10:45 p.m. Cause of death was described as “severe head injury.” The local high school principal subsequently told students, “If you’re going to box, do it right, go down to one of these boxing clubs.” |

The venue was the Battery D armory. During the first, Brennan was very active, but he also tired himself out. His seconds decided to fortify him with whiskey. Things went downhill from there, and the fight ended with Brennan grabbing on to Garrard, and then slumping to the floor. Cause of death was listed as concussion of the brain. Garrard and the seconds were arrested, but released the next day, after the injury was attributed to the fall rather than the blows. |

James spent the fight running. In the fourth, Bezenah struck James with a hard right to the neck. James went down. He remained unconscious, so was carried off the stage. Water was thrown on him, and he was left to recover while the sports returned to watch Jake Kilrain spar three rounds with Cleary. After that, there was some wrestling. James still had not recovered by the time the wrestling had ended, so a physician was sought. The physician arrived, but James still died about 11:30 p.m. that night. Cause of death was attributed to the “great excitement and exertion pending the contest,” and the principals were released on the grounds that there was no law regarding deaths that occurred in the course of properly licensed exhibitions. Bezenah was touring with William Muldoon and Jake Kilrain. Anyone who lasted 4 rounds with Bezenah got $25, so he specialized in doing fourth-round knockouts. At the time of this fight, he was 19 years old, and weighed about 137 pounds. In March 1891, a jealous suitor shot Bezenah twice in the stomach, and he died in April 1891 of the injuries. See Sandusky (Ohio) Daily Register, March 24, 1891, Mansfield (Ohio) Evening News, April 29, 1891, and Chicago Daily Tribune, February 15, 1890. |

McGlone died on February 24, 1891. McGlone had beaten Burns earlier in the month, by knockout, but died following a rematch. Cause of death was “congestion caused by blows upon the body next the heart.” McGlone left a widow and three children. This is noted because, although period newspapers called McGlone “Nicholas” or “Fox,” http://home.neo.rr.com/jmcglone/part5.htm notes that Henry McGlone of Natick was a pugilist of the John L. Sullivan era who had three children. |

Two ounce gloves were worn. The purse was $200 to the winner. The venue was a large hall, with a capacity of about 800 persons. Moments before the knockout, Majesty said, “I can’t see any longer. Hit me if you want to.” Which Seville did. The autopsy showed a ruptured blood vessel at the base of the brain. Seville was subsequently convicted of prizefighting, and sentenced to a year in prison. The conviction was appealed, on the grounds that gloves were worn and Queensberry Rules were followed. Hence, to Seville’s attorney, this was not a prizefight. In its published decision, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that it didn’t matter if Queensberry Rules or London Prize Ring rules were being used, or whether one called it a sparring match or a prizefight. Instead, “What was it, in plain English?” Consequently, Seville’s conviction for prizefighting was upheld. The relevant court case is Seville v. State, 15 L.R.A. 516, 49 Ohio St. 117, 27 W.L.B. 258, 30 N.E. 621; see also Robert Desty, ed., Lawyers’ Reports Annotated, Book XV (Rochester, New York: Lawyer’s Co-Operative Publishing Co., 1905), 518-520. |

This was the same Jack Burns as was involved in the fatal fight with McGlone, of Natick (Middletown, New York, Daily Press, May 27, 1891). During this fight, Burns was hit hard in the temple and jaw. He went down. As he rose, Tracy hit him again, with what the Chicago Daily Tribune called “a sledgehammer blow on the head that would have felled an ox.” This time, Burns stayed down. Cause of death was a broken blood vessel in the brain. On October 19, 1891, Tracy was convicted of manslaughter. |

The bout was fought with light gloves. McCormick was knocked down, and died a few hours later. Daniels and the seconds were arrested. NOTE: Galveston (Texas) Daily News, July 22, 1891, ran a story saying that McCormick was reported badly bruised, but alive, in Chicago, but this is unlikely, inasmuch as Daniels was not acquitted until October 9, 1891.

The referee was the famous Western lawman Bat Masterson, and after this decision, that paragon of frontier law enforcement promptly skipped town rather than face trial. |

The stage floor was wet with blood. Goodrich fell on the wet surface, and broke his neck. The death was ruled an accident, but the investigation does not seem to have been especially thorough, perhaps because the promoters were well-known white men from Louisiana while the deceased was a black man from Louisville, Kentucky. The venue for the bout was the Olympic Club, and soon after this death, the State took the Olympic Club to court, saying that its gloved boxing matches violated state laws against prize fighting. The court case was State v. Olympic Club, 24 L.R.A. 452, 15 So 190, April 1894. In this case, the court ruled that state laws against bare-knuckled prizefighting did not apply to gloved contests sponsored by regularly chartered athletic clubs. Instead, if the state wanted to ban gloved contests as well as bare-knuckle prizefights, then new laws would be required. |

The judge advised the jury to consider whether the fight violated laws against prizefighting. To the judge’s surprise, the grand jury responded with a verdict of no bill. The reason was that the police had been present and did not stop the fight. Thus, the jury decided that do what the judge instructed was against their duty.

Riordan was Fitzsimmons’ sparring partner, and he had not boxed competitively since losing to Jack Slavin in June 1892. Thus, Fitzsimmons normally took it easy on Riordan, who was also a heavy drinker. After being told of the death, Fitzsimmons said, “I knew he had been drinking hard, but did not know he was in such a condition... The blow that caused the trouble was as light as I could make it, I merely slapping him with the back of my hand. He fell down then rose and staggered around... When he fell headlong, I thought he was faking, and was thoroughly disgusted.” The death certificate listed the cause of death as “hemorrhage within the cranial cavity, causing compression of the brain.” The clot was on the right side of the brain, very deep. Fitzsimmons was arrested on a charge of manslaughter in the first degree, but was later acquitted. Fitzsimmons bought the burial plot for Riordan, in Section 51 of Oakwood Cemetery, and helped carry the casket, but no one ever bought Riordan a gravestone. |

According to Haley, “In the eighteenth round, Bowen ‘staggered around like a drunken man,’ clinched continually to save himself, and tried to avoid Lavigne’s blows. A right caught him in the jaw, though, and Bowen fell back and ‘his head hit the wooden floor with a thud which could have been heard a block away.’ The ring, as it turned out, was not padded; it was simply wooden planks, with a canvas tarp stretched across the top.” Bowen died the following morning without regaining consciousness. No doctors were called because of fears of adverse publicity. Lavigne and promoters were charged with manslaughter, but charges were dismissed after the coroner said the mechanism of injury was the fall rather than the blow. |

Croot fell with about 30 seconds left in the last round. Officially, the cause of death was Croot striking his head on the floor, and this caused the National Sporting Club to subsequently require padded floors. Although the seconds and promoter were arrested, the charges were dropped because the fight had been properly administered. Croot had been unconscious for over an hour following a fight with Pedlar Palmer in 1893.

Fort Wayne (Indiana) News, January 4, 1897; Brooklyn Daily Eagle, January 7, 1897; Dallas Morning News, January 5, 1897; National Police Gazette, January 16, 1897. Previously, following a fight with Bob Rooke in 1893, Duffy had been unconscious for about 5 hours. According to testimony given at the coroner’s inquest, there were no knockdowns during the fight, which was reportedly a slow one. At the end of the match, the boxers shook hands, and Duffy walked to his corner. He had trouble getting through the ropes, and he collapsed in the dressing room. An ambulance was called, and Duffy was taken to St. Vincent’s hospital, where surgery was done to relieve pressure on the brain. Nonetheless, he died the following day. The autopsy determined that the cause of death was meningeal hemorrhage compounded by hyperatrophy of the left ventricle of the heart. The jury attributed cause of death to excitement, and Duffy was acquitted. No physical exam had been done beforehand, so the jury recommended that physicians be employed by fight clubs. NOTE: This is probably the boxing death described in Charles Phelps, Traumatic Injuries of the Brain and Its Membranes (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1897), 534-535. |

Perry weighed about 175 pounds while Gibbons was about 165. Perry’s nose was broken in the first two rounds, and in the third, Gibbons took a heavy blow to the heart. Gibbons was clearly stunned, so the referee stopped the fight. Gibbons later collapsed, so he was taken to the hospital, where he died the following morning. Although the principals were charged, they were acquitted in December 1897. |

Stoudt was hit with a straight right, and according to the Ohio paper, “He fell as though he were shot, and his head struck the floor with a crack like a pistol shot.” However, the coroner’s jury ruled that it was the blow to the jaw that did the damage.

Devitt went down for some light punches, so the coroner’s jury attributed to his death to his own weak constitution. Griffiths was born in Sydney, Australia, in March 1871. He came to the United States in 1893, and at the time of this fight, he was probably the best featherweight boxer in the world. Afterwards, he became a notorious drunk, with frequent arrests.

But, the Daily Northwestern reported on March 30, 1900, it was Jack who fought the Italian, not Jim. Moreover, “Jack says it is a mistake, as he did not hit [the Italian] hard enough to hurt him, such being the understanding between the two men previous to the bout.” |

Franey had a good first three rounds. Later, he tired, and he was knocked out in the fourteenth round. (He was apparently unconscious on the way to the floor, as he landed face first.) He regained consciousness several hours later, but relapsed into a coma and died the afternoon of August 17. There was a hemorrhage on the left side of his brain and the examination of his lungs showed pleuretic adhesions. Charges were filed, but dismissed in September 1899. McConnell himself was badly injured after a 14-round knockout by Joe “Spider” Welch on January 15, 1903 (Mansfield, Ohio, News, January 16, 1903), and subsequently retired from the ring. |

(Groin protectors were not worn by boxers until about 1930.) However, at the prompting of the crowd, Hoskins asked that the fight be allowed to continue. It was. Hoskins was knocked out in the tenth, and he subsequently died. The following day, the coroner’s jury exonerated Pendergast. |

The bout was staged at the Pelican Club. Apfel reportedly misstepped, fell, and hit his head. A few hours after the fight, he fell unconscious. Autopsy determined cause of death to be cerebral hemorrhage following laceration of the brain. Fox was arrested. The jury ruled death to be due to the fall, and Fox was released. |

The Times account described Bellerson as “hog fat.” Neise was tall and lanky and the difference in appearance drew derision from the crowd. The first hard blow in the fight came in the sixth, when Bellerson hit Neise with a right to the jaw. Neise went down. As he struggled to get to his feet, Bellerson hit him again. (The neutral corner rule was still several decades in the future.) Neise’s head hit the floor with a thud. He was carried from the ring, and he died shortly afterwards. Cause of death was listed as a concussion of the brain. |

The boxers shook hands, and went to the dressing room, where Molina collapsed. He died the following morning. Cause of death was attributed to a burst blood vessel in the brain. Charges were filed, but the case was dropped after the witnesses refused to testify on grounds that testifying might incriminate them. (The papers described the boxers as amateurs, but a 9-round fight at the club rooms of a fraternal organization suggests a paid performance. Age at death is approximate, but it was “under 21 years,” according to the Naugatuck paper.) |

Cause of death was determined to be hemorrhage of the brain. (Following concussion, “it is better if a knocked-out athlete is not allowed to sleep.” C.

Livingstone was ahead during the first three rounds, then, during the fourth, he injured his right arm. He was knocked down in the seventh round, and he collapsed about a minute into the eighth. He died in hospital two days later. It was the fourth fatality in the National Sporting Club in just over three years, and as a result ten people were charged with “felonious slaying.” On April 25, 1901, Smith’s brother Nat told the press that the deceased had been given a laced drink in the seventh round, and that this had poisoned him. Said Nat Smith: “He had the fight won when he began to stagger about the ring and fell unconscious.” At the inquest, Dr. Dodd of Charing Cross testified that there was no evidence of drugging. Said the Scotsman: “When he saw the deceased one pupil was contracted and the other dilated, which in itself would negative any suggestion of a narcotic.” The jury was out for all of two minutes before returning a verdict of accidental death caused by “laceration on the right side of the brain.” Mechanism of death was attributed to a fall against the ring ropes in the fourth round. The court case is Rex v. Roberts and others, Central Criminal Court, June 28, 1901, cited at Arthur Frederick Bettinson and William Outram Tristam, The National Sporting Club Past and Present (London: Sands & Co., 1902), 163-205. |

During the same show, Teddy Pepper fought twice, and was knocked out both times. These two events caused significant problems for boxing in Chicago. Explained the Post-Standard, “These purely boxing clubs are operating in Chicago under a law which permits incorporated athletic clubs to give such exhibitions as are pure sporting events -- no admission fee and only members of the clubs being present. The boxing clubs get around this part of the law by selling their tickets on the quiet and depending upon the sporting columns of the daily papers for their advertising... [The police have taken the position ] that as they were orderly and no ill results ensued from their operations, [the police are] justified in leaving them alone. [However, the police] can close them up at will, for they are operating clearly in violation of the law.” |

Butte (Montana) Anacoda Standard, April 10, 1903. Because prizefighting was illegal in Montana, the bout was advertised as “a 10-round go for ‘exercise and points.’“ Consequently, this was described in court as a boxing bout rather than a prizefight. The gloves worn weighed about five pounds, and the hands were bandaged normally. About a minute into the second round, Taylor, in the words of the referee, “collapsed and went down in pieces.” He died soon after. When asked at the inquest if he had hit Taylor hard, White replied, “Why, to tell you the truth, I have hit my kid harder than Taylor was hit at any time last night.” Although the autopsy found great quantities of blood in the brain, the doctors attributed death to a diseased heart. Taylor was listed as a colored bootblack from New Orleans, while White was listed as mulatto. |

His corner threw in the towel, but he was still hit one last time. He collapsed to the floor and he died soon afterward. The coroner subsequently ruled that Bryant died from cerebral hemorrhage. Robinson was black and the writer for the Weekly Republican was aghast at the thought of a “grinning Negro” killing a white man. |

The jury said there was no blame because the blow had not been delivered maliciously. Although cause of death was brain hemorrhage, the mechanism was attributed to a punch to the solar plexus. (“The solar plexus blow causes unconsciousness by deranging the vagal tone of the body,” thus decreasing blood pressure, and possibly causing cardiac arrest. A reduced oxygen supply to the brain is also possible. E.S. Gurdjian and J.E. Webster, Head Injuries: Mechanisms, Diagnosis, and Management, Boston: Little, Brown, & Co., 1958, 350.) |

He walked to his corner, where he collapsed. He failed to get up at the start of the sixth, and the crowd yelled, “Fake!” Several doctors entered the ring, but he was pronounced dead fifteen minutes later. Cause of death was listed as heart trouble. NOTE: In September 1908, a boxer called Terry Martin, aged 27, was taken to the hospital in New York for treatment of his own serious head injury (New York Times, September 26, 1908). The opponent in this latter bout was Harry Lewis, who was the opponent during the Mike Ward death of November 1906. Martin recovered, however, and he continued boxing until shortly before his death in 1918. Meanwhile, Harry Lewis (Herman Besterman) lived until 1956, but was partially paralyzed secondary to injuries received during a bout in November 1913. |

Ward was from Sarnia, Ontario, and he and his cousin Michael Andrew Ward were both featherweight boxers. Ward had essentially retired from the ring a year before (he was studying to become a Roman Catholic priest), but was talked into one last contest. During the ninth round of this fight, he was knocked down. When he started to stand up up, he was knocked down again. (There was no neutral corner in those days.) This time, Ward’s head struck the unpadded floor with an audible thump, and that ended the match. Ward stood up, spoke a few words, and then collapsed. He died the following day. Cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage. Besterman was charged with first-degree murder, but was exonerated after the jury said that it was the fall rather than the blows that killed Ward. Nonetheless, Besterman was still fined $1,000 on charges of prizefighting. In addition, Grand Rapid’s laws were changed so that subsequently, only three-round bouts with 8-ounce gloves could be fought inside the city. |

Even though (or perhaps because) people in the audience at this bout included a state attorney, the county sheriff, and the lieutenant-governor of North Dakota, Gains was not present at the hearing. Instead, he reportedly left town. The cororner’s jury attributed Good’s death to pneumonia. |

Galveston (Texas) Daily News, June 6, 1909; New York Times, June 6, 1909; Los Angeles Times, June 6, 1909; Atlanta Constitution, June 6, 1909. The promoter was Dan Stuart, who tried to arrange a fight between Bob Fitzsimmons and Peter Maher in 1895. To circumvent anti-prizefighting laws,Stuart sold no tickets to the fight. Instead, it sold membership to Albert Raatz’s athletic club. By joining Raatz’s club, one received 12 lessons in physical culture, plus free attendance at a 20-round “sparring match” that would not end by draw. Although prizefighting was illegal in Texas, this bout was witnessed by a judge, the chief of police, the county sheriff, and Texas Rangers. In addition, the county clerk kept the collection. Five-ounce gloves were worn, and the two men were active throughout; according to the Atlanta paper, “By the end of the fifth round both men were covered with blood, even the referee was sprinkled with the blood of the fighters.” In the eleventh round, Lyons rushed Keppe, and for his efforts, was knocked through the ropes. He crawled or was pushed back into the ring, but was knocked down again, and the fight was stopped. Lyons sat dazed in his corner for about twenty mintues. His seconds then helped him down the street to a barber shop, where he was bathed. After that, he was taken to one of the seconds’ homes, and put to bed. He did not waken in the morning, so a doctor was called about 6:00 a.m., and he was pronounced dead about 9:15 a.m. Death was attributed to a rupture of the left middle meningeal artery, and attributed to a right-sided blow. When notified of the death, the police chief told reporters he did not stop the bout because everyone “seemed to like it.” In the sheriff’s opinion, no laws had been broken and Lyons’ death was due merely to an accident.” Added the gym owner, Albert Raatz: “It was a nice, friendly bout.” |

Cause of death was given as heart failure, “caused by compression of the brain, resulting from an infusion of blood from a lacerated artery.” His “coloured opponent” was arrested, but exonerated after the coroner opined that death was caused by the fall rather than a blow. |

Indianapolis Star, December 27, 1910; Washington Post, December 28, 1910; Chicago Daily Tribune, December 27, 1910; Oshkosh (Wisconsin) Daily Northwestern, June 17, 1914. Toward the end of the fourth, Parmentier was struck hard in the throat, and between the fifth and sixth rounds, he collapsed in his corner. He died twenty minutes later. Cause of death was attributed to hemorrhage of the brain. His father took the case to court, and the resulting case (Parmentier v. McGinnie, et al.) ended up in the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 1914. In this case, the Wisconsin court ruled that the boxing match was not the proximate cause of Parmentier’s death; consequently, Parmentier’s father was not entitled to recover damages from McGinnie, et al. This was not, however, a unanimous decision. Wrote the dissenting justice: “It seems to me that the deceased was killed in a fight, and that no other conclusion is warranted by the credible evidence.” In any event, the case law is 157 Wis. 596, 147 N.W. 1007. |

The death led to new rules in France: finish fights were prohibited, doctors had to be present ringside, professional boxers had to be aged at least 21 years, floors had to be padded, and gloves had to weigh at least four ounces. |

Walters, a Navy baker, was a former champion of the Asiatic Squadron, while Kanarowski was a professional boxer. The audience included at least 50 officers; civilians also may have been present. (The naval station commander denied this.) After the bout, Kanarowski said he didn’t feel well, and he collapsed in the shower room. Cause of death was blood clots in the brain, which the naval inquiry attributed to Kanarowski’s fight with Young Mike Mahoney in Appleton, Wisconsin, about six weeks earlier rather than this bout. Kanarowski’s brother replied that the Navy was doing a cover-up, and threatened civil action. |

Plant and J.C. Butt, “Laceration of vertebral artery. An historic boxing death,” American Journal of Forensic Medical Pathology, March 1993, 14:1, 61-64. The bout was billed as the White Heavyweight Championship of the World, and it lasted 1 minute, 46 seconds. Hit by a jab, McCarty clinched. As he broke from the clinch, McCarty stepped back, stiff but smiling. A beam of sunlight struck him and a photographer snapped a photograph. Then McCarty collapsed in a heap. The crowd shouted “Fake!” while the referee counted to ten. Seven physicians in the audience went to McCarty, but after an hour, they pronounced him dead. The coroner listed the cause of death as a broken neck, and attributed it to a fall from a horse that had occurred several days earlier. Nonetheless, eighty years later, researchers from the Chief Medical Examiners’ Office in Calgary reviewed the reports, and hypothesized that the cause of death was actually traumatic basal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Meanwhile, the subsequent court case established that under Canadian law, a gloved bout, even if fought for a prize, was a legitimate sporting event rather than an illegal prizefight. See R. v. Pelkey (1913), 4 W.R.R. at 1057, 21. Can. Cr. Cas. 387, 24 W.L.R. 804. |

Los Angeles Times, August 23, 1913; Los Angeles Times, August 24, 1913; Los Angeles Times, September 4, 1913; Oakland Tribune, January 13, 1914. Young, who had been a sparring partner for luckless Luther McCarty, had six fights preceding this one, and he lost to Willard in two of them. During the eleventh round of this otherwise slow and uninteresting bout, Young was hit a solid right uppercut to the chin. “Bull doubled up like a rag, fell back on his haunches, and then on his back, completely out,” De Witt Van Court wrote in the Los Angeles Times. Despite a trephining operation designed to reduce pressure on the brain, Young never regained consciousness. Cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage. In January 1914, a jury acquitted Willard of the charge of prizefighting, as defined by California statute, and this decision effectively legalized professional boxing in California. The statute (412) and revisions can be read in The Penal Code of the State of California by California and Charles Howard Fairall (Bancroft-Whitney, 1909), 204-206. The exception that acquitted Willard was that the statute authorized “sparring exhibitions not to exceed a limited number of rounds with gloves of not less than five ounces each in weight” when they were organized by incorporated athletic clubs that had paid county license fees and had a physician in attendance. |

From the Plattsburgh paper: “During the winter of 1917, Toddy Hicks, of Albany, struck Young McDonald, also of Albany, a right over the heart. McDonald dropped, was carried from the ring, and was found to be dead.” Cause of death was said to be “shock occasioned by a blow over the solar plexus.” The bout was one of the preliminaries on a full card (this was McDonald’s first professional fight), and the promoters continued the program despite McDonald’s death. This in turn caused Governor Charles E. Whitman to call for a repeal of the Malone Boxing Law. |

He was counted out and failed to revive. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. Cause of death was listed as acute dilation of the heart. |

Six-ounce gloves were worn. About midway through the first round, Boyer hit Frost in the stomach and head, then gave him a left hook to the jaw. Frost went down on his knees, then fell on his face. The referee, Johnny Ryan, immediately stopped the fight and called an ambulance. Frost was dead before he got to the hospital. Although he didn’t do any examination, the doctor gave cause of death as acute dilation of the heart caused by excitement and exertion. The Oklahoma judges ruled for the parents and against Teeters, saying that a boxing contest for money was a prizefight, no matter what euphemism you used to describe it, and adding that describing any prizefight as a “friendly sparring match” was akin to “describing a wild poker game and then terming it Sunday School.” The Oklahoma court also ruled that, in Oklahoma, “each person injured in mutual combat may recover from other all damages caused by injuries, assumption of risk rule not applying.” |

Centralia (Washington) Daily Chronicle, February 6, 1929; Seattle Times, February 7, 1929; Williamsport (Pennsylvania) Gazette and Bulletin, February 9, 1929. Cartwright had lost three fights by knockout since November 1928, and was unconscious for thirty minutes following a knockout in Oregon on February 1, 1929. Meanwhile, Geysel was in his fifth pro fight. During this fight, Cartwright with a couple moderate blows to the face. These caused Cartwright to fall straight backwards. Cartwright was counted out and carried to the dressing room, where he died twenty minutes later. Cause of death was listed as arterial bleeding at the base of the brain, and attributed to the fall rather than the blows. The coroner’s jury blamed Cartwright, a black man from Portland, for not telling the ringside physician his true age or that he had recent brain injuries. Everyone else with the fight was acquitted. Nonetheless, Cartwright’s family sued the survivor. The case law is Hart v. Geysel, 159 Wash. 632, 294 P. 570, 1930. The question asked here was, inasmuch as prizefighting was illegal in Washington, could a case for wrongful death be brought when both parties had consented to participate in an unlawful fight? The Washington Supreme Court’s answer was no. The promoters were also charged in a separate civil action, and that led to a delay in the legalization of professional boxing in Washington State. |

Hammond was pronounced dead at the hospital. Hammond’s widow, Margaret, subsequently sued the owners of the club and the City of Cortland. This led to an investigation. Although the fight was advertised as an amateur match, Morris testified that the matchmaker was supposed to pay both men $10 each after the fight was over. The six-ounce gloves Morris wore during the fight were old and worn. There was no weigh-in, and no doctor was present. |

This match took place at St. Bonaventure College. Although it was originally reported that the match was not sanctioned by the State Athletic Commission, the coroner’s jury was told that the match had been approved by a member of the State boxing commission. Moreover, the referee was the Olean chief of police. The coroner’s verdict was excusable homicide without negligence. Cause of death was listed in the newspapers as brain concussion and in subsequent court documents as a broken neck at C2. Anyway, after this hearing, Gustafson’s mother, Helma C.Gustafson, went to New York Life Insurance Company to collect on her son’s policy. The insurer paid face value of the policy without question, but balked at paying double indemnity for accidental death. So, it was back to court. In this case, the court (District Court, Western District Pennsylvania) ruled in favor of Mrs. Gustafson. First, there was no specific clause in the insurance contract stating specifically that boxing was a prohibited activity. Second, “no man has ordinarily any cause or reasonable ground to anticipate that when he engages in any of these games, death will result.” Thus, the death was accidental, and Mrs. Gustafson was entitled to double indemnity. The case law is Gustafson v. New York Life Ins. Co., 55 F.2d 235. |

Moraski was winning the bout on points. Then, after having been knocked down twice in the final round, Brown stood up and flattened Moraski. When the bell rang, the referee had just reached “four” in the count. Therefore, this was counted as a win for Moraski rather than a knockout for Brown. Cause of death was concussion. The grand jury in Wheeling exonerated Moraski in October 1930. |

Schaaf had recently recovered from influenza, and had only trained about ten days for the bout. Throughout the fight, Schaaf put up little defense. Indeed, sometimes he was seen walking into punches with his hands down. Consequently, the fans were booing and yelling “Fake!” as he went down, and subsequently, most sportswriters attributed the outcome of the fight to Carnera’s handlers’ Mob connections, and Schaaf’s death to a savage beating that he received at the hands of Max Baer in August 1932. |

Before boxing, he had been a star football player at Tulane, so the university retired his old number, 21, for five years to honor his memory. |

The coroner attributed death to asphyxiation -- Dragon had swallowed a piece of rubber he was using to protect his teeth. (Although dentists had been making mouth guards for boxers to use during training since at least 1902, affordable commercial mouth guards had only recently come into use. See, for example, J. L. Shapiro’s US Patent Office application for a tooth guard, application 1,644,284, dated October 4, 1927.) |

Matieshin was one of 32 boxers in Jack Dempsey’s White Hope boxing tournament. This was his third bout of the tournament, and after the second bout, Matieshin had told his sister and his handlers that he had severe head and jaw pain. However, there was no quitting if he wanted to get the prize of $500 and a trip to New York. In addition, there was no medical examination between bouts, just the one examination before the tournament began. Consequently, Matieshin entered the ring with Flanagan, was hit hard in the head, and dropped to the canvas in about 50 seconds. Cause of death was a rupture of a blood vessel on the right side of the brain. |

Shelaeff, who had boxed professionally in Harbin, Manchukuo, walked from the ring. Then he collapsed in the dressing room, and he died the next day. Cause of death was brain hemorrhage, perhaps secondary to earlier trauma; Shelaeff also had lobar pneumonia at the time of his death. Because there was no medical exam before the fight, Shelaeff’s father subsequently brought suit against the state athletic commission and the Disabled American Veterans, who organized the card (Fresno Bee, February 3, 1939). The court case is Shelaeff v. Groves, 27 F. Supp. 1018. The decision in this case was to dismiss the complaint: for public officers to be liable for tort, the officers must owe a statutory duty to the injured person. There was no statutory rule about this in the California code. In addition, there was nothing in the complaint indicating that anyone had done anything that was clearly wrong. Consequently, the court ruled that the state boxing commissioner and inspector “owed no duty to boxer to enforce requirement of physical examination, neglect of which would make them liable for boxer’s death.” |

New York Times, December 22, 1943, 28; Syracuse (New York) Herald Journal, December 22, 1943. Reasoner was behind on points in the ninth, and in the tenth, he was dropped by a left hook. He stood up at the count of one, but was then knocked down again. This time, he got up at the count of two. He was then knocked down a third time. With this, the fight was stopped. The cause of death was listed as traumatic cerebral hemorrhage and hemorrhage of the right kidney. Six weeks earlier, Reasoner had suffered concussion following a knockout, and this contributed to the Illinois Boxing Commission’s subsequent ruling that boxers who had been knocked out had to wait at least 60 days before fighting again (Madison, Wisconsin State Journal, June 28, 1947). |

Franklin had a pre-existing head injury, but fought anyway. He collapsed in the ring, and he died in hospital ten days later. Cause of death was attributed to multiple concussion hemorrhages. The medical examiner, Harrison S. Martland, could not say whether blows or the fall caused the death. Franklin’s death was the proximate cause of the development of rubber-padded ring floors. The first reported usage of rubber-padded mats in a professional contest took place in Newark, New Jersey, on July 7, 1947. According to the New York Times (July 8, 1947), inventor Thomas “Babe” Culnan “said he was unable to find material suitable for the protective layer until he saw a television show in which eggs were dropped on a rubberoid mat from a tall building and bounced without breaking.” |

Cause of death was attributed to concussion of the brain. The athletic commission said the death was unfortunate, but unavoidable because a thorough medical exam had been given. Nonetheless, the athletic commission still suspended Eck and his manager, Edward Fluck (Prince Henry). This suspension had nothing to do with the fact that Hines had lost 22 of his 23 career fights, 10 by knockout, and had been called in as a last minute substitute. Instead, it was because Eck and Fluck publicly protested the athletic commission having prohibited Eck from fighting while the athletic commission conducted its investigation. |

Doyle had been knocked out a year before, and was barred from fighting in California due to previous head injuries. At the inquest, the coroner asked Robinson if he thought Doyle had been in trouble during the fight. Robinson replied: “Getting him in trouble is my business as a boxer and a champion.” |

Nonetheless, he was licensed in January 1948, and this was his first pro bout. The purse was $75, which after management fees, meant $49.50 for Decatur. |

Darthard, a former national amateur flyweight champion, had fought 33 times in the past two years, and had been complaining of headaches before the fight. Nonetheless, he took the fight because he was sure that it would be his lucky break. However, it was not. Instead, he was knocked down twice during the third round. The referee refused to stop the fight. So, Lytell went back out, and hammered Darthard some more. Darthard was knocked down again in the sixth. After the sixth round ended, Lytell walked to his corner. He sat down, told his manager that all he knew was that he was fighting in Milwaukee, and then fell off his stool. He was carried out of the ring on a stretcher, and he died next morning. Cause of death was a blood clot on the left side of the brain. |

Berje walked shakily to his corner, and he collapsed in the dressing room. He was sent to the hospital, where he died the following morning. Cause of death was brain contusion. Mechanism of injury was attributed either to falls or blows. Following the inquest, the California State Athletic Commission made 8-ounce gloves and standing 8-counts mandatory. (Six-ounce gloves had been worn during this match because a recent athletic commission ruling requiring 8-ounce gloves had not yet gone into effect. No standing 8-counts were given, either, because that requirement also was not mandatory at the time.) |

Ring’s rookie of the year in 1947, Roach was severely beaten by Marcel Cerdan on March 12, 1948. He fought three more times and retired. In 1950, he decided to try a comeback. He won three fights. Before this fight, he had complained of a sore nose but nothing was found wrong; consequently, he was cleared to fight. During this fight, he was leading on points going into the ninth, then, in the tenth, he took a solid right to the jaw. He went down, but got up at the count of seven. He was knocked down a second time, and the referee stopped the fight without a count. Roach returned to his corner, and said, “Damn it, this would happen.” Then he collapsed. The ringside doctor ordered a stretcher, and Roach was taken to the hospital, where he died 14 hours later. Cause of death was listed as subdural hematoma. Although few people saw the fight live (the weather was bad that night in New York), the fight was televised. Fights were shown live in those days, and for the last few minutes of the allotted time, the cameras focused on the medical activity in Roach’s corner. |

The bout was on the undercard of the welterweight title fight between Kid Gavilan and Billy Graham. Although Donoghue was leading on points, the contest was fairly even for seven rounds. Then, in the eighth, Flores took a straight right to the mouth followed by a left hook to the chin. Flores hit the floor with an audible thud and the fight was stopped. Flores, visibly dazed, was rushed to the dressing room so that the ring could be prepared for the televised main event, and there he fell into a coma. Despite three surgeries in five days, he died in hospital. Cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage, but some of the cerebral edema pre-existed the fatal bout. This is not surprising -- Flores had averaged two fights per month for the past 21 months, and he had lost two fights in the past five weeks by technical knockout. Following the autopsy, Flores’s wife’s family sued the International Boxing Corporation for negligence. In 1957, with the case going to trial, the International Boxing Corporation settled out of court for $30,500 (about $250,000, in 2007 dollars). In addition, investigations started as the result of this suit directly contributed to the demise of the company itself, as the investigations revealed that the company’s practices were monopolistic and represented restraint of trade. The Flores family also sued the State Athletic Commission. In 1955, a New York superior court ruled that the Commission was responsible for the decisions of Commission-approved physicians, and awarded Mrs. Flores $80,000. The Commission appealed this determination, and, in a split decision, the appellate court reversed the lower court’s ruling. Taken together, these two suits greatly accelerated the use of foam-padded rings, ropes, and buckles in New York. In addition, the furor caused the State Athletic Commission to rule that boxers take a mandatory 30-day break following knockouts. Of note, however, is the fact that the medical opinion in this case actually said that a boxer should take a 60-90 day break following a knockout. As an aside, Marlon Brando’s famous line, “I could have been a contender,” is attributed to a post-fight conversation between Donogue and author Budd Schulberg. See Westchester (New York) Journal News, August 26, 2006, http://www.thejournalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060826/NEWS02/608260308/1018/NEWS02. The published case law is Rosensweig v. State, 5 N.Y.2d 404, 158 N.E.2d 229, 185 N.Y.S.2d 521 (N.Y. Apr 09, 1959) (NO. 31049). |

Merolla, “Cry Uncle,” WAIL! The CBZ Journal, May 2001, http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/w52x-jm.htm. This was a slow match that Sanders, the 1952 Olympic gold medalist, was leading on points. There had already been two knockouts on the card, and it was getting late, so the crowd was thinning. Then, in the eleventh, James connected with several blows to the head. Sanders, who had been visibly tiring, collapsed, and rolled over on his side. Sanders died in hospital sixteen hours later. Cause of death was subdural hematoma. The inquest found no one legally responsible for the death, but Justice Elijah Adlow of the Boston Municipal Court was nonetheless critical, stating in his decision, “It is a sad commentary on our sporting world that as Hayes Sanders sank to the floor, there were boos from the crowd.” |

New York Times, January 30, 1956; Traverse City (Michigan) Record-Eagle, February 2, 1956; Kingsport (Tennessee) News, February 4, 1956. The main event ended early, so Perry went into the ring as a standby, to fulfill the promoter’s television commitments. During the sixth, Perry was knocked through the ropes and the fight was stopped. Afterwards, Perry complained of severe headache, so he went to hospital, where he died two days later. Cause of death was a blood clot on the brain. |

Midway through the twelfth round, Griffith hit a flatfooted Paret eighteen times in just six seconds. Paret unsurprisingly slumped unconscious over the ropes, and he died in hospital ten days later. Cause of death was brain injury. The fight was broadcast live over national television, as the death was rerun frequently on news shows. This led to an investigation into boxing and a famous essay, namely Norman Cousins, “Who killed Benny Paret,” Saturday Review, 45:14 (May 5, 1962), 14, in which Cousins argued that more than anything else, it was the bloodlust of the audience that was responsible for boxers’ deaths. Subsequent court cases included Alfaro v. Joint Legislative Com. on Prof. Boxing, 36 Misc. 2d 1018, 234 N.Y.S. 2d 164, in which Paret’s former manager, Manuel Alfaro, was unsuccessfully trying to quash a subpoena issued by a state legislative inquiry into the “possibility that many boxers, managers and promoters might be under control of racketeers.” |

Knox was knocked out and remained unconscious until his death 30 hours later. Cause of death was a blood clot in the brain. Scandal followed this death. Although Knox officially weighed 178 at the pre-fight exam, at the autopsy, his actual weight was found to be 152. Meanwhile, Bethea weighed 205. In addition, he had been hospitalized following auto accidents in 1961 and 1963. However, he was on unemployment at the time, which suggests that he needed the $243 purse. Knox was managed by Mack Lewis. Another of Lewis’s boxers, John Hurtt, was fighting on the same card as Knox. At the time of this fight, Hurtt had two detached retinas, and he later went blind on the left side. |

This was a televised fight. Moore was the 1952 Olympics champion and current world champion, but he had starved himself to make weight. About 45 minutes after the end of the fight, he lapsed into unconsciousness, and he died three days later. His death was attributed to the fall rather than the blows that knocked him down; specifically, his head was said to have struck the ring ropes as he fell. The fight had been televised, and the death quickly became a political football and a media circus. (Bob Dylan’s song “Who Killed Davey Moore?” premiered on April 12, 1963; lyrics appear at http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/daveymoore.html.) Consequently, within a week of this death, the New York State Athletic Commission prohibited 6-ounce gloves and instituted a 3-knockdown rule. See New York Times, April 3, 1963, 54. California also introduced similar legislation. See Winnipeg (Manitoba) Free Press, March 26, 1963. |

Knocked down just before the final bell, James jumped up. He collapsed shortly after the end of the round, so he was taken to the hospital for a checkup. At the hospital, he lost consciousness, and he died six hours later. He reportedly had not recovered from injuries received in an auto accident shortly before the bout. Cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage, and attributed either to James striking his head against a rope or being post-concussional from a previous injury. There had been several other boxing deaths during the past few days, and this led to renewed calls for the abolition of boxing in the United Kingdom. |

Columbia (Missouri) Missourian, July 22, 1978; Los Angeles Times, July 22, 1978; New York Times, June 17, 1983. The fight was televised. Minter was champion of Europe, with a record of 30-6-0, and, as expected, Jacopucci, with a record of 7-3-0, was pummeled. A few hours after the fight, Jacopucci collapsed and went into a coma. Following two brain surgeries, he died in hospital two days later. In June 1983, the ringside doctor, Ezio Pimpinelli, was convicted of manslaughter. This death was the stated reason for subsequent European championships being scheduled for no more than 12 rounds. Television, though, is the more likely explanation for the change -- 12 rounds fit into an hour, but 15 require 90 minutes. |

Classen was hit hard in the head during the ninth. The ringside doctor checked him, and said he could continue. However, early in the tenth round, Classen was hit hard once again, and this time he was knocked out. Classen was then taken to the hospital, where he died five days later. Cause of death was listed as cardiac arrest secondary to acute subdural hematoma. His death was the proximate cause of two leading court cases, Classen v. State of New York, 131 Misc. 2d 346 (1985)/500 N.Y.S. 2d 460 (Ct. Cl. 1985) and Classen v. Izquierdo, 137 Misc. 2d 489 (1987)/ 520 N.Y.S. 2d 999 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1987). In the first case, the higher court ruled that there was no malpractice liability for the doctor who cleared Claasen to fight because the doctor had followed accepted procedures. In the second, the higher court ruled that the ringside physician’s duty to the athlete was the same inside the ring as it was inside a hospital or clinic. That is, he needed to follow accepted medical practice. Consequently, a failure to stop a fight on medical grounds could constitute malpractice if it was determined that the decision was contrary to accepted medical practice. The courts’ emphasis on accepted procedures and standards was part of the reason for a subsequent New York State Athletic Commission requirement for promoters to have ambulances on site during boxing matches. |

The fight was part of the undercard to the first Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran contest, and many fans had not arrived at the stadium. Hart was leading throughout the match, and late in the tenth round, he hit Denny at least four times in rapid succession. Denny collapsed and the referee stopped the fight. Denny lay on the mat, convulsing, but commission doctors failed to respond. Upon realizing that medical aid was not forthcoming, two physicians seated ringside, a family practitioner named Pierre Meunier and a television boxing analyst named Ferdie Pacheco, went through the ropes. “‘It was pretty obvious that Denny had suffered a serious cerebral injury,’ says Dr. Meunier, who watched as the boxer was bundled onto a stretcher for transport to nearby Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital. Just how serious became infinitely clear the next day, when Denny died without regaining consciousness” (Cardwell, 2001). The investigations into Denny’s death led to the resignation of two doctors from the Montreal Athletic Commission, and to Canadian ring physicians being given the authority to stop a match. The first time that Dr. Meunier, himself a ringside physician, used this power to stop a fight was during a pro contest held in 1984, and the riot that broke out in the stands after the stoppage was announced led to arrests. |

Washington Post, November 15, 1982; New York Times, November 18, 1982; Ralph Wiley, Serenity: A Boxing Memoir (New York: Henry Holt, 1989). Explained Wiley: “Kim was off-center, exhausted and facing Mancini’s corner. He never saw the punch. Mancini drove off his right foot and delivered the first of the final pair of rights on the point of the Korean’s chin. A glancing left hook followed, then a crushing right which sent Kim to the canvas. Kim landed heavily on his back and head, rolled over in slow motion, grabbed a middle strand of the ropes, and stared blankly at the timekeeper.” Kim died three days later, and both his mother and the referee subsequently committed suicide. Kim’s death was the proximate cause of Nevada adopting a standing 8-count and a 45-day layoff for boxers knocked out. It was also the reason the World Boxing Council gave for reducing the length of championship fights from 15 rounds to 12 (though of course television schedules provide a more probable explanation). For his part, Mancini just kept fighting. As Warren Zevon wrote in, “Boom Boom Mancini,” a song about a working man racing home to catch Mancini’s fight with Bobby Chacon on January 14, 1984, “They made hypocrite judgements after the fact/But the name of the game is be hit and hit back.” A Korean film, Champion, was subsequently made of Kim’s life and, unsurprisingly, it focused on his courage rather than his death.

After the fight, Gross spoke with reporters, and then, about 90 minutes later, he collapsed in the dressing room. He lapsed into a coma, and he died of injuries on January 28, 1990. Cause of death was subdural hematoma on the left side of the brain. In the interim, Gross’s family applied for workers’ compensation, and in 1990, an administrative law judge ruled that Gross had a valid claim, and that the family was eligible for survivors’ benefits. The State Insurance Fund appealed this decision, and in 1997, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court reversed the lower courts. That is, the appeals court ruled that professional boxers were ineligible for workers’ compensation through the State Fund. The court’s reasoning was that the plain language of the Workers’ Compensation Law specifically excluded “compensation for any injury occasioned ‘by wilful intention of the injured employee to bring about the injury or death of himself or another,’’ and that “it would be absurd to suggest that he [Gross] participated in that match without willfully intending to bring about the injury of his opponent.” The justices ruled 2-1 on this, and in his dissenting opinion, the dissenting justice wrote, in part, that “denying compensation to an entire class of athletes ... is not, we think, what the Legislature contemplated.” The case law is Estate of Gross v. Three Rivers Inn Inc., 238 A.D. 2d 12, 667 N.Y.S. 2d 71, 1997 N.Y. Slip Op. 11247. The split decision promptly led to another court case, namely 92 N.Y. 2d 970, 706 N.E. 2d 741, 683 N.Y.S. 2d 753, 1998, N.Y. Slip Op. 10243, which in turn remanded the case to the Workers’ Compensation Board for further proceedings on the employer-employee relationship at time of injury. |

In the ninth, a left hook caught Murray hard. He stayed on his feet, but went down in the twelfth. Members of the standing-room only crowd threw bottles in the ring and started fighting among themselves; some even rushed into the ring, to daub themselves in blood. Docherty stood crying in the corner, paramedics were too busy dodging bottles and chairs to safely administer first aid, and five fans were later treated for injuries. Eventually, Murray was taken to the hospital, where he died on October 15, 1995. Rapid weight loss was reportedly a factor in this death, which was commemorated by a 1997 song, “James Murray, by Mr Jones; for the lyrics, see http://www.mrjones.net/lyrics2.htm#james. |

Barreto was pulled to the canvas by an arm around the neck. He got back up, and was pummeled for his efforts. Dazed, he staggered to his corner, where he collapsed. He was subsequently refused admission at two hospitals, apparently because his family couldn’t show proof of insurance. |

Valdez fell into a coma after the fight and he died without ever regaining consciousness. Valdez had been visibly wobbly during the eighth and tenth rounds, but his trainer, Nelson Lopez, refused to throw in the towel. Said Lopez later: “How could I stop the fight? They would have said, ‘It’s ridiculous, a trainer bringing a fighter and not letting him fight.’ I don’t want anyone to get hurt, but that’s the sport we choose.” The proximate cause of death was ruptured blood vessels in the brain. |

Scottland was a last-minute replacement for another boxer, who had broken his nose in training. During the fight, Scottland took heavy punishment, but he was still defending himself. Consequently, the doctor and referee let him stay. Then, following a knockdown, he failed to get up and he subsequently died. Cause of death was subdural hematoma. In 2004, Scottland’s widow filed suit against the ringside physicians, alleging that they failed their duty to exercise reasonable care by stopping the fight. The judge ruled that the case was grounded in medical malpractice rather than negligence, and then dismissed the case because it was filed after New York’s 30-month statute of limitations on malpractice had expired. The case law is Scottland v. Duva Boxing LLC, 109169/04; a brief summary appears in Mark Fass, “Judge Dismisses Negligence Suit Against Ringside Doctors,” New York Law Journal, November 7, 2005. |

Rone took a hard kidney punch a few seconds before the end of the first round. Between rounds, he collapsed in his corner, and he was pronounced dead at the hospital. Cause of death was listed as heart failure, and because he collapsed between rounds, the fight was officially listed as no contest rather than loss by knockout. When Rone took the fight, his record was approximately 7-41-3, with 25 straight losses, 12 of them by knockout. Rone took the fight on 24-hour notice, apparently because he needed the $800 purse to pay for his mother’s funeral. Thomas Hauser subsequently reported (Seconds Out, May 27, 2004, http://www.secondsout.com/USA/colhauser.cfm?ccs=208&cs=13484; Seconds Out, June 4, 2004, http://www.secondsout.com/USA/colhauser.cfm?ccs=208&cs=13484) that federal authorities were investigating this death. The allegation was that the promoters had knowingly falsified medical records that were sent to the state boxing commission.

Sanchez walked out of the ring, but was observed walking strangely. His pupils were dilated, so he was taken to the hospital, where surgery was done. He died the following day. Cause of death was subdural hematoma. Before the fight, Sanchez may have faked medical records. In addition, his pre-fight weight loss program included jumping rope under the Nevada sun while wearing a sweat suit. Suspicions that the latter program contributed to his death was part of the motivation for the California Athletic Commission’s subsequent longitudinal study on weight loss in boxers. For an introduction to this California study, which began in January 2006, see http://www.dca.ca.gov/csac/about/1223_weightstudy.htm. |

He began dragging his leg en route to the dressing room, so he was taken to the hospital, where surgery was done within the hour. He died five days later. Cause of death was kidney failure and subdural hematoma. |

Before the fight, Payne reported headaches. However, he did not tell ringside doctors, apparently because this bout was important to his chances to appear in a televised fight scheduled for April 2006. About a minute before the end of the match, Payne began stumbling, and within minutes of being declared the winner, he was placed on a gurney and taken to the hospital. Surgery was done, but he still died the following afternoon. Cause of death was left-sided subdural hematoma. |

Bussell, who had boxed as an amateur in Oregon before turning pro in 2006, took the fight on short notice. He was doing well through the first five rounds. Then, during the sixth, he staggered, and almost immediately after the result was announced, he collapsed in the ring. The ambulance got him to the hospital within 17 minutes. Nonetheless, he died in hospital the following day. |

The match was fought catchweight, at 116 pounds. Sasakul was a former World Boxing Council flyweight (112 pound) champion, while Sisnorio was a fighter unlicensed for overseas fight who had lost his three previous fights. (His most recent loss had come just two months earlier, by knockout.) Cause of death was severe brain injury, and there was immediate discussion in the Filipino media of an intentional mismatch on the part of the Thai promoters. |

The fight was televised on pay-per-view in Indonesia. During the sixth round, Mulya was visibly tired, and his trainer asked that the fight be stopped. Mulya was then taken to the hospital, where he died five days later. Two brain surgeries were done. Then his blood platelet levels dropped, perhaps due to undiagnosed dengue fever, and he died. Cause of death was therefore listed as subdural and epidural hematoma compounded by low blood-platelet levels. |
