New Delhi, May 30: The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to cancel the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) 2018 and ordered the National University of Advanced Legal Studies (NUALS) to declare the results on May 31. The Common Law Admission Test 2018 result will be declared on the official website, clat.ac.in.
Petitions were filed, seeking cancellation of the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) conducted on 13 May and for a fresh examination to be held. A fresh petition was filed by advocates Zoheb Hossain and Rajendra Dangwal on Tuesday on behalf of 29 candidates from different states.
Petitioners had moved the apex court on May 23 and pleaded that examinees faced many technical problems during the online test, besides poor infrastructure at examination centres and lack of proper guidance from the staff.
The petitioners submitted that candidates across states faced serious problems at almost 200 online examination centres and said the prerequisites of proper electronic and online infrastructure were not made available in the conduct of the exam.
The manner in which the examination was held had jeopardised the future of thousands of students who took the examination, they pleaded.
