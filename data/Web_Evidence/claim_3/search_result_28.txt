Whereas, on January 20, 2021, President Biden also issued a ``Proclamation on the Termination Of Emergency With Respect To The Southern Border Of The United States And Redirection Of Funds Diverted To Border Wall Construction'', which halted construction of physical barriers along the international border between the United States and Mexico, and he later terminated existing border wall construction contracts and failed to obligate more than $1,000,000,000 that Congress had lawfully appropriated for border wall construction;

Whereas, in August 2022, the Department of Homeland Security terminated the Migrant Protection Protocols (commonly known as the Remain in Mexico policy), which required aliens with pending asylum claims to wait in Mexico; Whereas, during fiscal year 2021, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement executed 59,000 deportations, which represents the lowest number of deportations since fiscal year 2008, and fewer than \1/3\ as many deportations as the number of people who were deported during fiscal year 2020, and is significantly lower than the 226,000 to 410,000 removals that occurred every fiscal year since 2008;

Whereas, on September 30, 2021, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas issued a memorandum titled ``Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law'', which stated that an alien's illegal status in the United States should not be the sole basis of an enforcement action and prioritized for apprehension and removal aliens who are a threat to national security, public safety, or border security;

8 U.S.C. 1701 note) when asked if the Department of Homeland Security had operational control of the border; Whereas, on January 6, 2023, the Biden Administration abused its parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) to create a new parole program for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela; Whereas, on April 27, 2023, the Biden Administration further abused its parole authority by creating a new family reunification parole process, which grants parole to entire categories of aliens rather than granting parole on a case-by-case basis, as required under such section 212(d)(5); Whereas the Biden Administration created a parole with conditions policy authorizing U.S. Border Patrol agents to release aliens through parole before they are given a Notice to Appear or entered into removal proceedings; Whereas the Biden Administration has expanded the use of the CBP One app, allowing tens of thousands of aliens to enter the United States unlawfully to hide the mass immigration surge following the termination of the order of suspension issued by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under section 362 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 265) as a result of the public health emergency relating to the COVID-19 pandemic (commonly known as the ``title 42 order''); Whereas drug cartels are receiving an estimated $13,000,000,000 each year from their human smuggling operations across the southern border of the United States, which represents an enormous increase from the estimated $500,000,000 the drug cartels received in 2018 from such operations;

Tax payments by illegal aliens are equal to approximately \1/6\ of the costs incurred by government entities in the United States on their behalf; Whereas, during fiscal year 2022, total Federal justice enforcement expenditures as a result of illegal immigration were $25,100,000,000 and total Federal welfare program expenditures for illegal aliens were $11,600,000,000; Whereas, in April 2023, the Biden Administration proposed a plan to expand healthcare access for aliens granted deferred action pursuant to the final rule submitted by the Department of Homeland Security titled ``Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals'' (87 Fed.
