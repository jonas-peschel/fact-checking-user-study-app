Brief History of CLAT
Let’s know about the history of CLAT:
- In 2008, something important happened in law studies in India. The National Law School of India University (NLSIU) in Bangalore, the oldest NLU in the country, introduced the CLAT exam. It was a big deal because it changed how students got into law colleges.
- At first, a committee from seven NLUs got together to decide how CLAT would work. They decided that each year, a different NLU would organize the exam. This meant that CLAT was conducted by different NLU each year, starting with NLU Bangalore in 2008 and continuing to others like Hyderabad, Bhopal, and Kolkata in the following years.
- In 2019, things changed again. All the NLUs came together to form a group called the Consortium of NLUs. This group took over the responsibility of organizing CLAT exams from then on. It was a big step towards making CLAT exams fair and consistent for everyone.
- Before CLAT, every NLU had its own entrance exam. This made things hard for students because they had to prepare for different exams at the same time. CLAT changed that by giving students one common exam to focus on.
- CLAT was started because students found it tough to prepare for multiple exams, and sometimes they missed out on opportunities. There was even a court case about it in 2006. The court agreed that there should be one common law entrance exam, so CLAT came into existence in 2008.
- Even though most NLUs now use CLAT for admissions, NLU Delhi still has its own entrance exam called AILET.
