Second Amendment
I am a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, which the courts have affirmed guarantees an individual's right to keep and bear arms. Millions of Americans across this country own firearms peaceably.
There is no doubt that our Second Amendment rights are threatened. I will remain vigilant and oppose the Biden administration's misguided proposals, but my plan is not to merely be on defense. I began my term by cosponsoring the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which would allow people with state-issued concealed carry licenses or permits to conceal a handgun in any other state, so long as the permit holder follows the laws of that state.
I will oppose any efforts aimed at weakening the Second Amendment. Punishing law-abiding Americans for the violent actions taken by those who seek to cause harm is not a solution to the problems we face in our country. Instead, Congress should work on legislation that keeps firearms out of the hands of those who illegally seek to harm themselves or others while also protecting our fundamental rights.
Congress is also making record investments in mental health resources for those who need help so that we can prevent crises before they occur. These programs will greatly move the needle on decreasing violence and increasing access to necessary resources. But the work does not end here. As I have said before, the answer to violence will not be found in legislation passed by the federal government. We cannot delegate the responsibility of responding to despair and mediating distrust and division in our communities. Elected officials, community leaders, churches, and families all have a role in coming together to rebuild our sense of goodwill and repair the bonds that have frayed between us, and the resources provided for these efforts is a welcome investment in the unity of our nation.
