Analysis
Ideology–Leadership Chart
Biden is shown as a purple triangle ▲ in our ideology-leadership chart below. Each dot was a member of the Senate in 2008 positioned according to our ideology score (left to right) and our leadership score (leaders are toward the top).
The chart is based on the bills legislators sponsored and cosponsored from Jan. 7, 2003 to Dec. 11, 2008. See full analysis methodology.
Enacted Legislation
Biden was the primary sponsor of 42 bills that were enacted. The most recent include:
- S. 3605 (110th): Criminal History Background Checks Pilot Extension Act of 2008
- S. 1738 (110th): PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008
- S. 3370 (110th): Libyan Claims Resolution Act
- S. 2565 (110th): Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery Act of 2008
- S. 3061 (110th): William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008
- S. 3218 (110th): Criminal History Background Checks Pilot Extension Act of 2008
- S. 2731 (110th): Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008
Does 42 not sound like a lot? Very few bills are ever enacted — most legislators sponsor only a handful that are signed into law. But there are other legislative activities that we don’t track that are also important, including offering amendments, committee work and oversight of the other branches, and constituent services.
We consider a bill enacted if one of the following is true: a) it is enacted itself, b) it has a companion bill in the other chamber (as identified by Congress) which was enacted, or c) if at least about half of its provisions were incorporated into bills that were enacted (as determined by an automated text analysis, applicable beginning with bills in the 110th Congress).

Voting Record
Key Votes
Missed Votes
From Jan 1973 to Jan 2009, Biden missed 1,781 of 14,556 roll call votes, which is 12.2%. This is much worse than the median of 2.0% among the lifetime records of senators serving in Jan 2009. The chart below reports missed votes over time.
We don’t track why legislators miss votes, but it’s often due to medical absences, major life events, and running for higher office. Legislators running for president or vice president typically miss votes while on the campaign trail — that’s normal. See our analysis of presidential candidates’ missed votes.
