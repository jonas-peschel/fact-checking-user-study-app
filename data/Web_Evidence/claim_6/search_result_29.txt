Any government shutdown could potentially affect an employee’s pay regardless of whether he or she has accepted the deferred resignation offer. Moreover, if you accept the deferred resignation offer, you would still be entitled to backpay under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019. See 31 U.S.C. 1341(c)(2).
Yes. Employees who are eligible for the deferred resignation offer and are at least age 50 with at least 20 years creditable Federal service, or any age with at least 25 years creditable Federal service are eligible for VERA along with the deferred resignation offer (unless your position is exempted from the deferred resignation program by your agency).

If your retirement date is between October 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025, you are still eligible for deferred resignation (unless your position is exempted from the deferred resignation program by your agency).

You are welcome to type “resign and retire” into the reply email, but it is not required. If you simply write “resign,” and you are eligible for retirement on or before December 31, 2025, we will process your separation as of September 30, 2025, OR your approved separation date. If retiring, you will additionally need to submit a retirement application for processing in accordance with applicable law at some point prior to your retirement date (though it’s not necessary to do so before February 10). For information on retirement, please visit OPM’s Retirement Center webpage or contact your agency’s human resources office.

Nothing. You have no obligation to respond to the email. Accepting deferred resignation is in your sole discretion and is completely voluntary.
Deferred resignation will generally not be available to those who resign after the program closes. Certain exceptions might be made for employees who were on approved absence for some or all of the period while the program was open.
Employees have the right to request a rescission of their resignation at any time and the employing agency will need to review such recission requests. As noted in the deferred resignation letter, it is the objective of the program to move quickly to consolidate and/or reassign roles and in many cases place employees on administrative leave which would likely serve as a valid reason to deny recission requests.
If you missed the program deadline due to approved absence for some or all of the period while the program was open, you are entitled to request an extension. Employing agencies may grant reasonable extensions.
Yes, you may unilaterally accelerate your final resignation date for any reason.
The terms of the deferred resignation letter do not allow for an extension of the final resignation date. There is a narrow possible exception for employees with impending retirement dates. Consult your agency's human resources team for more information.
