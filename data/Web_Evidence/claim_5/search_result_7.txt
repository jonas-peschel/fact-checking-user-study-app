The recently indefinitely-delayed Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) has been re-scheduled to be held on Monday, 7 September 2020, according to several authoritative sources with knowledge of the development.
Update 21:25: According to a draft of the notification we have seen, which will be shared with candidates probably later this evening, in its meeting today the CLAT consortium’s “General Body assessed the prevailing lockdown situation in various parts of the country and the health and safety protocols necessary for the conduct of this exam”, and had decided:
The CLAT 2020 examination for both UG and PG candidates will be held on 7th, September 2020 from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM...
The Consortium is in the process of securing further permissions so that the Admit Cards of candidates shall be considered as Movement Passes by local authorities to allow candidates to move between Containment zones and travel to their designated examination centre.
Admit Cards of the candidates indicating the Roll number and Centre shall be available for download from the website (consortiumofnlus.ac.in) in 2 weeks’ time.
Update 21:42: The notification has been announced on the official CLAT social media channels now (see below for image).
We understand that a Monday 7 September date was picked for the exam (rather than a weekend, as is customary for CLAT) since several states, such as Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu have instituted lockdowns on weekends, which would put a spanner in the works of an exam physically held at test centres, such as the CLAT.
Also, the main joint entrance examination (JEE) for IITs is scheduled to end on Sunday, 6 September.
A majority of the CLAT consortium of vice-chancellors (VCs) had agreed and voted in favour of the new date this evening, following their decision last week to postpone the exam from 22 August, as we had first revealed on 5 August.
As we had reported back then, an early draft of the notification had included language that the new CLAT date would be announced with a minimum of 21 days’ notice and in any case before 1 September.
The later notification did not include any such timelines, which makes sense in light of today’s speedy decision to announce a new date.
The main reasons for the postponement from August had been that several states had announced full lockdowns for the entire month, while the Ministry of Home Affairs had ordered a ban on mass academic congregations that month.
Due to being a physical exam held via computers at test centres, the CLAT had also announced detailed health and safety measures to minimise the spread of Covid-19.
Those same measures will also apply for the September date, according to the new notification.

Also there is a PIL pending for postponement of NEET and JEE mains

These days students mental state are not ready to face random decisions.
what is the point of postponing an exam just 14-15 days ?
The meaningless QAs by these bloated parliamentary bodies. The govt will do what it will. Because it can.
I am seeing comments stating we don't know whether neet JEE will be postponed or not. How does date of JEE affect date of clat? ( I know there are students who have to give both) but how is it possible that if JEE is postponed clat will also be postponed?
CLAT is a state-led endeavor to have a single competitive exam for most NLUs, as such the CLAT committee has a duty to act reasonably and hold the exam on a day when it is likely to not create problems for candidates. As currently announced this has not been achieved and in fact may disadvantage anyone who has the JEE the previous day. Scheduling it on a weekend when no other similar exam is being held is hardly asking for much. Ironically most of these VCs will refrain from back to back exams for their pampered LLB students but have no hesitation forcing candidates to do the same.
It's no more or less absolute than the problems of writing two national competitive exams on consecutive days.
Maybe masochism is your thing but dont force others to subscribe to it. Your post is a classic exam of the quality of lawyers I see these days who enjoy objecting in isolation with such spurious (and superficial) arguments for the heck of it.
But if you didn't get the 1 am example I am glad to explain it (since I understand some people may have cognition problems).
Giving back to back national entrance exams in engineering and law is physically taxing, mentally draining and lets agree .. very difficult both physically and mentally. I hope we can agree to this? (unless, like I said, you are a masochist)
Traveling 50 km at 1 am in the night to an exam center is also physically difficulty, logistically challenging and mentally stressful .. I think we can agree to this also?
This is not a court so I do not want to make foolish lawyerly objections like "relative" and "absolute" (In a sense both are relative and both are absolute) but I hope we can agree that both are challenging in their own ways, both can affect a lot of people (except outliers) and both are not very hard to avoid.
I already said in the beginning that candidates have no bargaining power so they will be forced to write the exam on terms made by the CLAT committee and lets face it, going to court is not a practical option for most people (so please no lawyerly clever responses like - go to court blah blah). They have to grin and bear it because as you said "life's unfair".
This is not a debate about whether life is unfair. Its about whether the CLAT committee has a sense of decency and fairness to go the extra mile and see to it that such difficulties are avoided. Surely a candidate who pays Rs 4,000 fee for an exam can expect some effort will be made to ensure such situations are avoided?
Anyway your desperate efforts to defend this inexplicable decision by CLAT is just proof of the lack of humanity that is prevalent in this country's educated lot. Why fault Modi for making workers walk a thousand km (yes, life was unfair to them also) when creme-de-la-creme lawyers think it's perfectly ok to have back-to-back entrance exams because "life's unfair".
CLAT is no longer a small exam to be planned and conducted in such a haphazard manner. Please keep this in mind.
You do not have to be meticulous in planning, but you cannot be so puerile either.
let me tell you , life is much more important than an exam and you cant imagine what some people ( including clat aspirants ) are facing these days ( financially,physically,mentally etc ).
death is no joke and even seeing a family member corona positive is not a joke.
While other eminent NLUs have been generous to its students and decided to give general promotion to its students by evaluating based on previous semester examinations and/or internal assessments, Balraj Chauhan has created uncertainty for its students and is not ready to opt the same model opted by other NLUs. Also, while other NLUs have started the new session, ours has not started.

Under him, DNLU has not even published its financial statements online till now. Everything is happening opaquely.I have recommended that the students should be allowed to submit project in fulfillment of
their end semester examination. I am waiting for the approval of the Hon’ble Chancellor.
I would like to bring to your attention that as per the guidelines of the UGC and the BCI, an
examination is an integral part of the education system at tertiary level and it is an indicator of
students’ progressive learning, knowledge, skills and other competencies required in every walks
of life. The performance in examinations contributes to excellence, lifelong credibility, and wider
international recognition for scholarships and awards in the academic and professional world that
leaves a good impression in the prevailing society of learners and educators to a great extent.
To safeguard the larger and best interest of the students pertaining to their academic and career
headway in a global platform, and as per the norms of the university, there is a mandatory clause
for general promotion of the students to the next semester/year that, in this context I have
announced repeat examination scheduled for those students who have not cleared their paper of
the previous semester/year, as that they may also be considered for the General Promotion, as per
the norms of the University.
Undoubtedly, the university could give general promotion provided that the students for
general promotion should have passed all the previous semester/year examinations. It has come
to my notice that some of the students have not passed the previous semester/year examination.
Therefore, such students need to meet the prerequisites to general promotion from their end by
appearing in the repeat examination as scheduled and communicated to you by the university. As
a result, each student will get the equivalent opportunity to avail the benefit of general promotion
with ease. For the rest of the students, the university has recommended the same and is waiting
for the approval and the directions by the Hon’ble Chancellor. As soon as things come in proper
shape I will duly and positively inform you. I hope you understand this. I assure you that no
student will be put to any inconvenience as well.

but i just wanna say stay strong guys. most important thing is we learn in this situation. hope you guys are doing good. :D
Some entrance tests/board exams were conducted (in Karnataka) despite COVID. We are unlikely to ever know how many got directly infected as a result of that obstinacy. But the numbers have been climbing up since then and the government is doing what it does best....politics.
This is likely the story in other states as well. Some like Kerala and Rajasthan are probably doing better because they suffered and learnt from previous viral outbreaks, such as swine flu, Nipah etc. Some are also doing "better" but politics says so. Isn't it strange that political opponents who are always bickering are now maintaining a studied silence on why the full capacity of RT-PCR testing is not being utilized or raised but there is a rush to do more rapid antigen tests, which have a far lesser precision? And the "falling rates" do not spell out how many of these are via rapid antigen and not through RT-PCR.
I don't know about other locations. But this is a glimpse of what is happening here thewire.in/health/covid-19-kolkata-advance-payment-wbcerc and the politicos and bureaucrats have no meaningful answers or solutions.
This is all politics and we will pay the price. As always. Before there is a "medical end" to COVID, the "political end" will be announced shortly, perhaps from the ramparts of Red Fort and in state capitals thereafter. Massive messaging of "political end" is theoretically supposed to bring about a "social end", which will help with electoral politics.
If only the virus was as obedient as us.
Best of luck to us. May we all live well to argue and troll again.
Make sense ?
It's not like we are running from exam,but health should be first priority.
And being uncomfortable is not the same thing as being oppressed. Take responsibility for your own education for a bit and prioritise whether you want to write clat or jee or whatever other exam you have. The world is not going to always give you the best and most comfortable options. It’s not unfair.
You should have been preparing for these tests for a year or two by now- one or two days here and there, and having to write another test on the same day should not make that much of a difference.
CLAT consortium - lets do this then ( as we have sop right! )
Students - we are in the endgame now
Logic - line busy
..
Conclusion- once deadpool said- Maximum effort.
There is no confirmation from BCI or NUJS that they have secured the affiliation.
Kian, why don't you do a follow-up on this? You covered BCI spat with DU Law Dept quite extensively. And you have a good friend in the current BCI Chairperson.
If NKC had nothing to do (since he was "away in KIIT") why is he so hell bent on killing off inquiries? His mates here are involved?
Kian, can we have your "yellow journalism" back again....that which exposed NALSARgate; gave NUJS students voice when PIB & Co were bleeding NUJS dry of talent and funds; took on the BCI etc. Are you suggesting that lack of an assistant or two is making you skimp and go fluff?
The inquiry almost got killed off but official complaints by certain faculty members and compelling evidence ensured that the EC sanctioned an inquiry by the Additional AG of West Bengal. NKC lashed out by removing two faculty members from the EC and replacing them with his acolytes who also happen to be buddies of the Associate Prof in question.
As with other EC inquiries that were sent into a black hole by NKC, this inquiry is also going to go the "NKC way" because the EC in its "wisdom" has now tasked NKC to inquire further including two Professor buddies of the Associate Prof (promotion in abeyance) who helped fudge the relevant paperwork. Basically fraud and forgery.
This is like tasking the fox to look after the chickens. I agree that after Zootopia, I should not be saying this but the reality holds true for NUJS. So after the wishy washy 2017 faculty recruitment, this too shall bite the dust.
Coming up: further scams in upcoming faculty recruitment. Ten posts were sanctioned. But NKC unilaterally increases it to 16 (all "in the interests of students"). Because he needs to bring in in his acolytes.
Kian, it is time that you took your blinkers off. Remember how you were initially misled on distance edu till you finally (possibly grudgingly) agreed to allow the "other side" of the story. You are still partial to those who plead-a-lot camp. That's okay. Give space to facts as well.
Let us all contribute to undeclared (and chimeral) herd immunity. Will those who "fall" receive care and protection from purveyors (and their minions) of Atmanirbharata?
According to SC (yes if it's just three self-declared grandees) if a few crore of students (combined) miss out on national entrance tests, the future of nation is imperiled. But when greater numbers across generations have been missing out on schools etc due to intersecting poverty, caste, religion etc then it's Shining India.
Not that the so-called Nyay (even if powered by some Nobel) helps. Didn't help when the Family and its retainers ran the country.
www.telegraphindia.com/world/first-confirmed-case-of-coronavirus-reinfection/cid/1790013
Same thing happened with the inquiry into distance education. That report was unanimously rejected by the EC. Instead of completing the inquiry, NKC had the entire matter quietly dropped from the agenda of the subsequent EC. No updates on the cases in Calcutta HC or the status of refunds as directed by the Delhi HC.
Something similar is expected with the Inquiry Report authored by the Addl AG of WB that slammed an acolyte of NKC for falsifying information for the promotion to Associate Prof rank. Had it not been for the doggedness of the complainants, NKC would have succeeded in not only burying this inquiry but also the Report. Here too, NKC is stalling the circulation of the Report to EC members despite discussion in the EC.
NKC pleads that he inherited a legacy of scams and since he was away in KIIT, he had/has nothing to do with those scams. Why then is NKC so invested in suppressing inquiries and doing a PIB repeat? If the WB govt really wanted the scams to fester they wouldn't have insisted on sending a team to rifle through NUJS accounts. Is NKC and Co bad mouthing state and using scare tactics ("loss of autonomy" etc) to mislead us from their own sins?
Did you know that NUJS till date has no service rules for faculty, non-teaching and admin staffs?
After previous attempts faltered www.legallyindia.com/law-schools/nujs-drafts-draconian-service-rules-limited-various-freedoms and www.legallyindia.com/lawschools/revealed-ex-judge-wrote-patently-illegal-nujs-service-rules-for-rs-75k-condemned-by-profs-as-suicidal-20160923-7992 (friend of the acolyte who recently got slammed) another attempt initiated under NKC suffered a similar fate.
However, NKC is now citing this "absence of service rules" as an excuse to (primarily) provide relief to two of his acolytes who took lien to further their careers elsewhere but wanted to retain "permanent status" here just in case things went sideways. One leapfrogged to the geographical centre of India. The other got so spooked by distance education and other inquiries that he nearly reached Arabian Sea. Symbiotic relations with PIB ensured that he got an upgrade later in a different institution.
UGC rules clearly state that a faculty member is entitled to a maximum of 5 years of leave (including academic, professional etc). Both these gentlemen exhausted the limit and are in breach right now. They knew and accepted the terms of their leave (2 years) when they were granted those by the EC. Thereafter the EC repeatedly underlined that they are in breach and should immediately re-join or their "permanent positions" here should be revoked. We also suffered effects of faculty crunch and "loss of these assets". But NKC and Co kept pursuing laxity so that these acolytes are well-positioned for the faculty recruitment. That way they would also get academic ranks for quicker entry into EC and strengthen NKC against the "state" (all in the name of "autonomy"). No more external inquiries and audit.
NKC and Co almost succeeded. But some EC members (unfortunately, for a change) went through the service and leave records. The evidence could not be ignored. The excuses of the acolytes and NKC and Co rang hollow, especially if the correspondence dates are logged. Hence after a vigorous discussion, the EC resolved to terminate the "permanent positions" that these honourable gentlemen held here.
The concerned acolytes whose permanent positions here got terminated were already slated to gain entry through the much touted faculty recruitment by NKC. Cannot understand why NKC and Co are regurgitating the tired excuses that the EC had rejected after a thorough discussion. Because the EC minutes are in fudge factory? Acolytes will lose confidence in NKC? Promised manna may never come?
