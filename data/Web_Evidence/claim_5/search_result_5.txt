The General Body of the Consortium of National Law Universities on Monday held a meeting to review the precautionary measures taken in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic and settle on a feasible date for conducting the CLAT 2020 exam.
At this meeting, the General Body assessed the prevailing lockdown situation in various parts of the country and the health and safety protocols necessary for the conduct of this exam.
According to the decision of Consortium, the CLAT 2020 examination for both UG and PG candidates will be held on September 7, 2020, from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm. Per the Consortium’s notification dated June 30, the CLAT 2020 will be conducted through a centre-based, online computer-based test.
The Consortium will review centre locations on an ongoing basis to ensure that students and staff are protected at all times.
