Governor Murphy Signs Legislation Strengthening Workers’ Rights and Labor Education
“Workers are the backbone of our state,” said Governor Murphy. “Today, we are honoring the history of the labor movement while strengthening workers’ rights. Our actions today will help ensure that students understand the history of labor’s fight for fair wages and safe workplaces, while also promoting respect for our democracy by shielding employees from mandatory political or religious workplace messaging.”
“As New Jersey continues to lead the nation as a beacon for workers’ rights, these measures further demonstrate a commitment to supporting labor education and protecting workplace freedoms,” said Robert Asaro-Angelo, Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. “Integrating labor history into our schools equips future generations with the knowledge and respect for those who have fought and continue to advocate for fair and equitable workplaces. Protecting employees from political or religious pressures on the job ensures that every worker can exercise their rights without fear. This progress reflects the state’s dedication to fostering an environment where workers can thrive with the dignity they deserve.”
The first bill, A1682/S1054, will ensure that the contributions, history, and heritage of labor movements are included in the New Jersey Student Learning Standards for Social Studies for students in grades 6-12. The State Board of Education will be required to adopt standards about the history of labor and labor movements. School districts will also be required to provide instruction on United States and New Jersey labor history as part of the Social Studies curriculum, including the history of organized labor, notable strikes throughout history, unionization drives, and the collective bargaining process and existing legal protections in the workplace.
“Instruction on the history of the labor movement provides students with essential knowledge they need to fully understand economic systems, workers’ rights, and the significance of organized labor,” said Kevin Dehmer, Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Education. “By codifying this important subject into law, we highlight the vital role that labor history has played in shaping New Jersey and our nation.”
The prime sponsors for this bill are Assemblyman Reginald Atkins, Assemblywoman Linda Carter, Assemblyman William B. Sampson, Senator Linda Greenstein, and Senator Vin Gopal.
“The labor movement has played a pivotal role in building the middle class and securing protections that many of us take for granted today,” said Assemblyman Reginald Atkins. “With this law, we are making sure our students understand the history and recognize the power of collective action in achieving fairness and dignity for workers.”
“This legislation is about education and empowerment,” said Assemblywoman Linda Carter. “By teaching students about the labor movement, we give them the tools to appreciate the sacrifices of those who came before them and to carry those lessons into the challenges of today’s workforce.”
“As a union member myself, I know firsthand how important it is to recognize the labor movements legacy,” said Assemblyman William Sampson. This law ensures that our young people not only learn about workers struggles and triumphs, but also understand how solidarity and advocacy continue to shape our communities and economy.”
“New Jersey has a long history of strong, organized labor. Teaching this history is crucial for preparing students to be informed, engaged, and empowered participants in the workforce and civic life,” said Senator Greenstein. “In doing so, individuals will learn how to think critically about the role of labor in society and advocate for their own rights in the future.”
“Unions are responsible for the many strides forward in developing stronger labor laws over the past century,” said Senator Vin Gopal. “It is important for younger generations to understand the power that they have when it comes to collectively advocating for what they believe in.”
The second bill, A4429/S3302, expands prohibitions on employers concerning requirements for employees to attend or listen to communications related to political or religious matters. This bill makes clear that employers cannot mandate employees participate in communications about certain political matters, including mandatory meetings regarding the decision to join or support a labor organization or association. Such mandatory meetings, often called "captive audience" meetings, are a tactic some employers use to try and dissuade and threaten employees from forming or joining a union.
The legislation also strikes a careful balance by including certain exceptions to protect employer speech, such as the ability to hold voluntary meetings, transmit legally required information, and conduct workplace anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training.
The prime sponsors for A4429/S3302 are Assemblyman Anthony Verrelli, Assemblyman Wayne DeAngelo, Assemblyman Christian Barranco, Senator Joe Lagana, and Senator Vin Gopal.
“This bill is about protecting workers' rights and making sure every person is treated with respect and dignity in the workplace,” said Assemblyman Anthony Verrelli, Chair of the Assembly Labor Committee. “Whether it's how they're going to vote in an election or if they want to join or participate in a union, they must be allowed the freedom to make their own decisions, free from intimidation. That’s what this legislation is all about, giving workers the confidence that their voices truly matter.”
“I was proud to sponsor this legislation because every New Jersey worker should be free to exercise their rights and every employer should respect those rights,” said Assemblyman Wayne DeAngelo. “At the end of the day, these protections will make our workplaces stronger and our communities more secure, because when workers thrive, so do their families and the neighborhoods they call home.”
“An employer can have views and express them, but they cannot coerce employees to accept them as fact at mandatory meetings. This is about prohibiting retaliation against workers in New Jersey who have a right to reject the political opinions of their bosses, not about restricting speech,” Assemblyman Christian Barranco said.
“No worker should ever be compelled to sit through meetings where their employer pressures them on how to think, act, or organize,” said Senator Joe Lagana. “This bill sends a clear message: all employees deserve a respectful and inclusive workplace, free of political intimidation or retribution from those in positions of power.”
“This law protects a basic freedom: the right to do your job without intimidation, coercion, or fear of retaliation," said Senator Vin Gopal. It ensures that no one is pressured into political, religious, or other deeply personal conversations in order to keep their job and reinforces that workplace rights should never depend on personal beliefs or views.”
“Today, New Jersey is showing what it looks like to lead for working people,” said Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO. “One bill Governor Murphy will sign bans one of union-busters’ favorite tactics, in which they force workers into meetings to listen to religious and political speech, including anti-union propaganda, in an effort to sow misinformation and intimidate them out of their organizing. The second bill will ensure that New Jersey students learn about unions’ critical role in building the middle class and improving the lives of working people in schools. Learning about the labor movement’s struggles and progress empowers students to not only understand labor’s contributions to our past, but the importance of unions to our future. I commend the New Jersey State AFL-CIO and the governor for working together to protect workers’ fundamental freedoms and make this groundbreaking education law a reality. We urge other states to follow New Jersey’s lead.”
“As working people, we deserve both a voice in the workplace and respect for the history that built our rights. Governor Murphy’s signing of these bills is a powerful step forward for New Jersey’s workers and future generations," said Anthony Abrantes, Assistant Executive Secretary – Treasurer, Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters. By strengthening protections against mandatory political meetings through A4429/S3302, we ensure that no worker can be coerced into listening to political agendas that don’t reflect their own values. This bill safeguards the basic principle that a worker’s time on the job belongs to their craft and their livelihood, not to political messaging. Equally important, A1682/S1054 guarantees that the story of the labor movement—the struggles, sacrifices, and victories of working men and women—becomes part of every student’s education. When young people learn how unions helped build fair wages, safe workplaces, and dignity on the job, they gain the tools to carry that fight forward. Together, these bills protect workers today and inspire the labor leaders of tomorrow. The Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters applauds Governor Murphy and the legislature for standing with working families.”
“Governor Murphy has signed a significant amount of pro-labor legislation into law over the past seven and a half years, and the addition of these two laws further illustrates his commitment to working families and unions,” said Charles Wowkanech, President of the New Jersey State AFL-CIO. “We sincerely appreciate his support, as well as the leadership of the prime sponsors of these bills for their advocacy. These new laws address two important issues – protecting workers’ rights to free speech in the workplace by banning “captive audience” meetings and educating students about the role unions play in the economy and society. The labor education law is important because many of these students will soon enter the workforce, and because of this law, they will be knowledgeable about how and why unions are formed and are necessary. Understanding the positive contributions made by unions is important and will now be taught in grades 6-12 so students have a better understanding and knowledge of how relevant organized labor is. Collectively, these two new laws illustrate that New Jersey continues to be a strong union state.”
“No one should be forced into a captive meeting on the job to listen to anti-union rhetoric and political agendas from unscrupulous employers,” said Bill Mullen, President of the New Jersey Building and Construction Trades Council. “With the help of the governor and the legislature, this law puts an end to that nonsense and ensures the men and women of the building trades — and all workers — can focus on their craft without intimidation, distraction, or fear.”
“Labor history is American history,” said NJEA President Steve Beatty. “As a history teacher and labor leader, I understand the direct connection between strong unions and a more prosperous American working class. Students should understand the hardships endured and sacrifices made by working women and men of every generation as they fought for safer working conditions, better pay and retirement security. So many of their hard-won gains are under attack today. When students understand the past, they are better equipped to work for a brighter future.”
“Today’s bill signings are a victory for New Jersey’s working families and a testament to the power of the labor movement,” said Ana Maria Hill, Vice President and NJ State Director, 32BJ SEIU. “No worker should be forced to sit through meetings designed to silence their voice, and every young person deserves to know the proud history of workers who fought for fairness, dignity, and justice. With these bills, New Jersey is making it clear that workers’ voices belong at the heart of our workplaces and our classrooms. We are grateful to Governor Murphy, Senate President Scutari, Speaker Coughlin, and the bill sponsors for standing shoulder to shoulder with workers and helping us build a stronger, fairer New Jersey for all.”
“We thank Governor Murphy for signing these important pieces of legislation. Mandating the teaching of labor history to future generations will ensure that they understand the rights and benefits they enjoy have been secured through the efforts of organized labor,” said Lori Ann Ames, President, United Service Workers Union. “It is essential that we continue to empower and support working men and women so that these hard-won rights are preserved.”
"UFCW Local 360 is proud to stand with Governor Murphy in advancing policies that put workers first and strengthen the future of our state,” said UFCW Local 360 President Sam Ferraino.“By protecting our rights in the workplace and giving students a stronger understanding of the history of labor, these laws will help empower the next generation while safeguarding the rights of those already on the job."
"On behalf of UFCW Local 152, I am pleased to see Governor Murphy deliver for working families by signing these pro-labor bills into law,” said UFCW Local 152 President Daniel Ross, Jr. “By strengthening workers’ rights and providing students’ a clear path to education on the labor movement, these measures demonstrate our shared values of protection, fairness, and access to opportunities for working men and women in New Jersey."
"HPAE members are thrilled to see Governor Murphy sign A4429/S3302 into law today," said Debbie White, President of Health Professionals and Allied Employees. "For far too long employers have forced workers to attend mandatory anti-union meetings that disseminate misinformation and create an environment of intimidation and fear. Workers can finally unionize free from coercion and threats of discipline from the employer. We applaud our legislators and the Governor for passing this legislation into law."
"The New Jersey PTA strongly supports bill A1682/S1054, which directs the State Board of Education to adopt and require instruction on U.S. labor history and the contributions of the labor movement as part of the New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Social Studies for grades 6 through 12. This important curriculum will deepen students’ understanding of the history of organized labor, the collective bargaining process, and the legal protections that exist in today’s workplaces. We thank Governor Murphy for his support of this legislation,” said Sharon Roseboro, President, New Jersey PTA.
“As Dr. King famously said, ‘the labor movement is the principal force that transformed misery and despair into hope and progress,’” said Andy Cassagnol, Executive Vice President, 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East. “That statement is as true today as it was 60 years ago. It’s vital that the organizing rights of New Jersey workers are protected, and that the history of our labor movement—central to who we are as a state and nation— is taught to the next generation. The caregivers of 1199SEIU applaud Gov. Murphy and the legislative leadership for passing these bills.”
“For too long workers were forced into captive audience meetings, where their voices were silenced. With this Bill A4429/S3302 the choice finally belongs to the worker not the boss," said Teamsters Joint Council #73, President, Alphonse Rispoli. This is a victory for fairness, freedom, and true democracy in the workplace. On behalf of Teamsters Joint Council #73 members especially John Doherty, we wish to thank the Sponsors , Co-Sponsors and the Governor Murphy for making this law a reality.”
“Teaching the history of labor and the labor movement is more important than ever before," said Orlando Riley, Chairman of Amalgamated Transit Union NJ State Joint Council. "With so many attacks on Unions, educating our future leaders on the struggles and the importance of Unions will only strengthen the working class. Thank you to Governor Murphy for his steadfast commitment to ensuring that working people are protected and supported by our great state”.
Governor Murphy’s signing of these two landmark bills is a victory for every working family in New Jersey. By requiring labor history to be taught in our schools, the state ensures that the next generation understands the sacrifices and struggles that built the workplace protections we have today. At the same time, by protecting workers from being forced to sit through captive audience meetings, New Jersey is defending the dignity and independence every worker deserves on the job. SMART-TD applauds Governor Murphy for taking this bold step to stand with our workers," said Ron Sabol, New Jersey and Delaware State and Safety Legislative Director, SMART-TD
“Governor Murphy’s signature on these bills is a win for working people across New Jersey. Teaching labor history in our schools ensures young people learn that the rights we have today – fair wages, safe conditions, the ability to stand together – were fought for and earned by generations of workers. At the same time, protecting employees from being forced to listen to political speeches at work reinforces a simple principle: the job site should be a place of respect, not coercion,” said Jerome Johnson Smart-TD Local 60.
“The American labor movement is essential to U.S. history, so that alone makes it worthy of instruction across New Jersey’s school districts. It’s important for students to know how labor unions have shaped our country’s laws and policies around workers’ rights. Labor unions are also the reason child labor laws were enacted almost 90 years ago, giving children the opportunity to attend school and pursue a vocation of their choice instead of needing to work to support their families. Thanks to A1682/S1054 becoming law, New Jersey’s students will learn about these and other society-changing standards that emerged from the labor movement," said AFT New Jersey President Jennifer S. Higgins.
“UNITE HERE Local 54 applauds Governor Murphy for the signing of these two historic bills, reaffirming New Jersey’s leadership in protecting workers and honoring their legacy. By ensuring that labor history is taught in our schools, the state is giving future generations the knowledge that rights on the job were never handed down—they were won through struggle, solidarity, and sacrifice. At the same time, by shielding workers from employer-mandated political speech, New Jersey is strengthening the principle that every worker deserves a voice free from coercion in the workplace. Together, these laws remind us that labor’s past and labor’s present are deeply connected: education ensures the story of working people endures, while protections on the job safeguard their dignity today. This is the essence of the labor movement—defending rights, advancing justice, and making sure tomorrow’s workers inherit a stronger foundation than the one before,” stated Donna DeCaprio, President, UNITE HERE Local 54.
“As a lifelong IBEW member I am so proud we support A4429/S3302 and A1682/S1054 as crucial protections for working people. By passing these bills, we take meaningful steps toward safeguarding worker dignity and promoting a deeper understanding of labor’s vital role in our communities,” said Wyatt Earp, President, Monmouth and Ocean Counties Central Labor Union.
“The Fraternal Order of Police supports these bills because they uphold the fundamental rights of workers. These measures reflect a commitment to fairness, dignity, and civic awareness, principles we believe are essential to a just society,” said Executive Vice President Bob Gries, NJ State FOP.
“We are excited to witness Governor Murphy sign these vital measures to uphold worker autonomy and advance labor education. It is essential that employees are not compelled to participate in meetings that infringe upon their individual rights. Furthermore, integrating the history and significance of the labor movement into the public education system will ensure that the contributions of working men and women are properly recognized and preserved. These bills represent that New Jersey is the quintessential organized labor state," said Al Laubsch, Business Manager, IBEW Local Union 30
“The NJ State FMBA applauds Governor Murphy for the signing of two critical pieces of legislation to protect workers and build upon the history of organized labor in our state. Foremost, ensuring that workers are not forced to attend certain meetings protects their personal rights and freedom on the job. These bills strengthen the foundation of a fairer and more informed workplace,” said Ed Donnelly, President, NJ State FMBA.
