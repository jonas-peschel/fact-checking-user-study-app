This page will be updated upon bills making it to the Governorâ€™s desk.
Enrolled acts signed by the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore are sent to the Office of the Lt. Governor for signature, are then returned to the Office of the Secretary of the Senate (for Senate Enrolled Acts) or the Clerk of the House of Representatives (for House Enrolled Acts), and then go to the Office of the Governor. From there, the Governor reviews all legislation and has seven days to sign or veto the bill. If he does not sign it, it automatically becomes law on the eighth day after receipt.
