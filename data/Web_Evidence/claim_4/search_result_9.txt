It’s now past curfew in Kenosha, but about 100 to 150 protesters are still at the park across from the county courthouse.
About 75 police in riot gear also remain in a long line stretching one block in front of the Courthouse, protecting the front door and building facade directly across from Civic Center Park.
About half an hour ago, tensions spiked as protesters hurled bottles at the police line, chanting “Black Lives Matter” and “F*** the police”.
Police threw tear gas into the crowd, dispersing many of the protesters. The smell of tear gas still permeates the air now.
Other fireworks are being set off every few minutes. Protesters have resumed throwing bottles, now hidden behind one of the burned-out dump trucks from last night.
All the while, an open bed SUV or pickup loaded with massive speakers plays anti-police themed music, including classics from the group NWA.

Kenosha District Attorney says he hopes federal prosecutors will pursue a civil rights investigation
Michael Graveley, the district attorney of Kenosha County, said on Monday that he hopes the US Attorney’s Office and federal prosecutors would conduct a parallel investigation into the shooting of Jacob Blake.
“And so I’m hoping they will do an investigation that takes place at the same time, which will allow this community to heal sooner because independent prosecuting agencies will be able to make determinations at the same time about whether any criminal charges will be produced,” he added.
He added that the Attorney General’s office and their prosecuting agency had also reached out to offer assistance.

Jacob Blake still in intensive care after being shot multiple times, his attorney says
From CNN's Gisela Crespo
attorney Ben Crump
CNN
Jacob Blake, the man who was shot multiple times in the back on Sunday by police officers in Kenosha, Wisconsin, is still in intensive care, the attorney representing him and his family told CNN Monday.
During an interview on CNN’s “The Situation Room,” attorney Ben Crump said that while Blake is stable, “they cannot tell at this moment what his prognosis would be.”
Crump added Blake’s children — who were in the car Blake was trying to enter when he was shot — will have to deal with the psychological issues from “seeing their father shot these many times in the back from the people who were supposed to protect and serve him.”
“We are still waiting for the facts to be confirmed but what it does tell us — whether is George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks — there is an issue with the culture and the behavior of policing in America,” Crump told Blitzer. “If we don’t have the systematic reform that this moment in America is crying out for, then we are going to continue to see hashtag after hashtag, protest after protest, and cities burning all across America.”
Crump said he doesn’t know of additional footage of the shooting, but he has heard from people who said witnessed the incident and he’s hoping to learn more.
“The family wants these police officers to be held accountable and the one who shot [Blake] — they want him terminated,” he said.

Kenosha district attorney says investigation is at its "earliest stages"
From CNN's Raja Razek
Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley discussed in a news conference Monday the process “to get justice for all the parties who are involved” in the case, including Jacob Blake and the officers at the scene.
Graveley said the investigation has started, but it is at its “earliest stages.”
“The Kenosha Police Department has asked for the Division of Criminal Investigation, DCI, to be the investigating agency,” he said. “They are a completely independent agency.”
Once the investigation is completed, the investigation results and the materials gathered will be given to the Kenosha District Attorney’s Office.
At which point, the district attorney’s office will review “those things.”
“If those two things are concluded as a yes, then criminal charges would be brought at the end of that process,” he added.

Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes said Jacob Blake was shot seven times by Kenosha Police Department.
“Jacob Blake was shot in the back seven times in front of his children. And let me be clear, this was not an accident. This was not bad police work. This felt like some sort of vendetta being taking out on a member of our community,” he said in a live message streamed today.
According to Barnes, Blake was trying to deescalate a situation in his community.
“The irony is not lost on me that as Jacob Blake was actually trying to deescalate a situation in his community, but the responding officer didn’t feel the need to do the same,” he said.
