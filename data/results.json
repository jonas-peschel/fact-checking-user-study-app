Hunter Biden and had no experience in natural gas, no experience in the energy sector, no experience with Ukrainian regulatory affairs. As far as we know, he doesn't speak Ukrainian.

He did have one priceless qualification: his unique position as the son of the vice president of the United States, newborn Ukraine\u2019s most crucial ally. Weeks before Biden came on, Ukraine\u2019s government had collapsed amid a popular revolution, giving its gas a newly strategic importance as an alternative to Russia\u2019s, housed in a potentially democratic country.

Hunter Biden resigned from Amtrak in February 2009, shortly after the inauguration of Barack Obama, when his father Joe Biden became vice-president. He resumed lobbying, and was counsel at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, until the Ukrainian oil and gas firm Burisma Holdings appointed him to its board of directors in April 2014.[113] As Hunter Biden had no prior experience in Ukraine or the energy sector, some viewed this as a likely attempt to buy influence via his father, though Hunter Biden was hired to conduct general corporate consulting rather than to provide energy expertise.[114] Hunter Biden's employment was described by some as a potential conflict of interest, and advisors to the Obama administration considered the situation awkward.[115]",

            "Nigeria is one of the two African countries\u2014South Africa being the other\u2014for which detailed data is available in the dataset, and we chose Nigeria as an interesting case study as explained above. According to Wier and Zucman, in 2019, Nigeria lost 26% (South Africa loses 13%) of its corporate tax revenue to tax havens. Data is available concerning losses attributed to EU havens (specifically, Belgium, Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, and the Netherlands) and non-EU tax havens (Switzerland and others, which are aggregated) [93]. We analyse the potential of additional government revenue for Nigeria equivalent to the revenue lost to all tax havens and to European tax havens, if profits were taxed at Nigeria\u2019s statutory corporate income tax rate of 30%. We rounded this figure to the nearest million. Profits shifted to two jurisdictions\u2014Cyprus and Malta\u2014resulted in less than US$0.5 million in corporate income tax revenue loss in Nigeria and have been excluded.",
            "Nigeria is one of the African countries with the highest illicit financial flows, according to a landmark 2015 report written by the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa, which was a panel tasked by the African Union Commission and the UN Economic Commission for Africa to address illicit financial flows and make recommendations on how to curb them [88]. The Nigerian government, as part of its Integrated National Financing Framework, which is the national level sustainable financing plan to achieve the SDGs, identifies the primary contributors to illicit financial flows as \u201caggressive corporate tax avoidance, abusive transfer pricing, and trade mis-invoicing\u201d [89]. Although Nigeria has a low tax-to-GDP ratio (6.7% compared to the African average of 15.6% in 2021), corporate income tax accounts for the largest share of tax revenues (35%) [90].",
            "The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone is entitled to economic and social rights essential to survive and thrive (Articles 25 and 26) and everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which their rights and freedom can be realised (Article 28). These rights must be ensured through national efforts and international cooperation (Article 22), but many millions of people worldwide do not access their rights, including the right to clean drinking water, safe sanitation, healthcare, and education. Government revenue from taxes plays a crucial role in ensuring these rights. However, globally, 10% of corporate tax revenue is lost because multinational corporations shift their profits from where they operate. This study examines the impact of profit shifting on tax revenue in Nigeria, focussing on access to economic and social rights and governance. It estimates the impact of revenue gains made on profits shifted from Nigeria to European tax havens, using data on profits shifted published by Wier and Zucman in 2022 and the Government Revenue and Development Estimations (GRADE) model for the estimations. The findings reveal that if the Nigerian government had additional revenue equivalent to tax losses, an additional 500,000 Nigerians would have their right to drink clean water and nearly 800,000 their right to use basic sanitation each day, 150,000 children would have their right to education, and 11 children would have their right to survive each day (amounting to 4,063 children each year). Increased revenue would also improve governance. In contrast, the gains European tax havens make as destinations for shifted profits in terms of rights are almost negligible, given that almost all Europeans have those economic and social rights discussed in this paper fulfilled. The tax reforms championed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including 27 European member nations, to tackle aggressive corporate tax avoidance and tax evasion\u2014in short, tax abuse\u2014fall short of ensuring a suitable international order for rights to be achieved. To remedy this, all European countries must support negotiations on international tax cooperation at the United Nations. This should include reforms on regulating multinational corporations, particularly through unitary taxation with formulary apportionment. In the short- and medium-term, interim measures to mitigate the harmful impacts of profit shifting are necessary. Countries must take steps to raise the global minimum corporate tax rate, introduce unilateral measures to tax multinational corporations, improve tax transparency and information sharing with lower-income countries, and strengthen anti-avoidance rules.",

            "In 2005 Nigeria's inflation rate was an estimated 15.6%. Nigeria's goal under the National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS) program is to reduce inflation to the single digits.[58] By 2015, Nigeria's inflation stood at 9%. In 2005, the federal government had expenditures of US$13.54 billion but revenues of only US$12.86 billion, resulting in a budget deficit of 5%. By 2012, expenditures stood at $31.61 billion, while revenues were $54.48 billion.[59] In 2024, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) raised the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) again, this time to 18.5%, the 6th consecutive increase since September 2022.[60]",
            "The oil boom of the 1970s led Nigeria to neglect its strong agricultural and light manufacturing bases in favor of an unhealthy dependence on crude oil. Oil and gas exports account for more than 95% of export earnings and over 80% of federal government revenue. New oil wealth and the concurrent decline of other economic sectors fueled massive migration to the cities and led to increasingly widespread poverty, especially in rural areas. A collapse of basic infrastructure and social services since the early 1980s accompanied this trend. By 2002 Nigeria\u2019s per capita income had plunged to about one-quarter of its mid-1970s high, below the level at independence. Along with the endemic malaise of Nigeria\u2019s non-oil sectors, the economy continues to witness massive growth of \u201cinformal sector\u201d economic activities, estimated by some to be as high as 75% of the total economy.",
            "Immediately prior to Babangida's rise to power, which is viewed by some [who?] as having been orchestrated by international oil and banking interests[dubious \u2013 discuss], the International Monetary Fund was exerting increasingly acute pressure on the Nigerian government to repay its massive debts, of which 44% of all federal revenue was already servicing.[33] Therefore, it was unsurprising when Babangida implemented the IMF's Structural Adjustment Program in October 1986 in order to facilitate debt repayment. The SAP was extremely controversial while it was in effect between 1986 and 1988. While it did permit Nigerian exports to become more competitive internationally and spurred a degree of economic growth, the SAP also incurred a dramatic drop in real wages for the majority of Nigerians. This, combined with major cuts to important public services, incited public unrest so extreme that Babangida's Armed Forces Ruling Council was obliged to partially reverse the SAP initiatives and return to inflationary economic policies. Babangida's rule also oversaw the annihilation of the Nigerian economic middle class, and Nigeria's entry to the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, despite Muslims accounting for less than 50% of the Nigerian populace.",
            "A 1982 Revenue Act implemented by the Shagari government would eventually be modified by yet another military regime in 1984 via Decree 36 which reduced the government share of oil revenue from 80% to 55%. States got 32.5% and 10% went to local governments.[41] The remaining 1.5% was earmarked as a special fund to new develop oil-producing areas, but during the Shagari regime the corruption in Nigerian governance reached its zenith and capital flight out of Nigeria peaked, while people in the oil-producing areas continued to receive little or none of the oil profits. Additionally, 1980 saw oil-generated revenues attain an all-time high of US$24.9 billion but Nigeria still managed an international debt of $9 billion.",
            "But before corrective actions may be recommended, it will do to understand why and how such ill-informed policy that has drained the country of billions of dollars since its inception became part of the apparatus for macro-managing the national economy. The oil and gas industry accounts for approximately 90% of Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange earnings, and 80.6% of the federal governments revenue; thus it is a major and commanding sector in the economy that sustains the annual expenditure of federal and state governments. In 1956 when oil was discovered in Oloibiri, Nigeria, foreign oil companies such as Shell have had working arrangements with the federal government that gave proper consideration to the investment made by these firms in exploration, drilling and extraction of oil, and in return the government received a certain percentage of the revenue derived. But at all times, ownership right of discovered oil wells resided with the government; the oil companies were in effect lessees. Under such regime of revenue sharing, the federal government was assured receipt of funds it could expend on national development projects, and any residual sum not expended would ideally go into established Sovereign Wealth Funds. The formulaic process need not detain us here, but such understanding informed best practices adopted by Nigeria and other members of OPEC, and still do, but alas without Nigeria. The federal government of Nigeria, for reasons best known to its political elites, allocated oil wells (oil blocks as commonly described) to individuals whose only qualification for such entitlement is their proximity to the center of political power.

This event coincided with the declaration of Nigeria's Second Republic. At this juncture, the oil producing states of the Niger Delta were accounting for 82% of all federal government revenue but the population of these areas received very little compensation and demands for adequate reimbursement for the black gold extracted from their land could be heard at this time. Overall, petroleum accounted for 96% of all government external revenue but a mere 27% of the nation's GDP. However, the advent of democracy did not improve the situation.",
            "Another disturbing trend had also been gaining steam in Nigeria since the early 1970s: a steep drop in agricultural production correlating roughly with the rise in federal revenues from petroleum extraction. Whereas previously Nigeria had been the world's lead exporter of cocoa, production of this cash crop dropped by 43%, while productivity in other important income generators like rubber (29%), groundnuts (64%), and cotton (65%) plummeted as well between 1972 and 1983.[33] The decline in agricultural production was not limited to cash crops amid the oil boom, and national output of staple foodstuffs also fell. This situation contrasts to Nigeria in 1960 just after independence, when despite British underdevelopment, the nation was more or less self-sufficient in terms of food supply, while crops made up 97% of all revenue from exports. The drop in production was so substantial that by the early 1980s the NPN government was forced to implement a now notorious import license scheme which essentially involved Nigeria, for the first time in its history, importing basic food items. However, as Nigerian activist and Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka asserts, \"the import license scam that was used by the party as a reward and enticement for party loyalists and would-be supporters cost the nation billions of dollars...while food production in the country virtually ceased\".[42]",
            "The reforms undertaken to consolidate public finances will do little to reduce the public deficit in 2025. Despite diversification efforts, revenues (9.4% of GDP in 2023) remain highly dependent on oil revenues (2.9% of GDP in 2023, or 30% of public sector revenues). However, they should benefit from an increase in oil production in 2025. Non-oil revenues will also rise, thanks to an increase in VAT from 7.5% to 10% and a broadening of the tax base. Expenditure (13.6% of GDP) will be rationalised. The partial resumption of fuel subsidies have weighed heavily on public accounts in 2024 (2.8% of GDP), but they should cease in 2025. That said, interest on debt servicing (3.3% of GDP and 35% of consolidated public revenues in 2023) remains high, compared with staff remuneration (1.9% of GDP) and capital expenditure (1.9% of GDP). By 2025, the government should cease to have its deficit financed by the central bank. It will opt for external and domestic financing, mainly through bond issues, despite high interest rates. Public debt is 35%-denominated in foreign currencies and limited to the federal level, with a domestic share of 62% and an external share of 38%. External debt (16% of GDP) is held by multilateral creditors (50%), bilateral creditors (14%) and bondholders (36%). In August 2023, Nigeria took out a USD 3.3 billion loan against future hydrocarbon production with Afreximbank to stabilise the naira. It is seeking a similar loan, this time to strengthen NNPC's finances and enable investment in the sector. Nigeria is due to repay a USD 1.1 billion eurobond in November 2025.",
            "Although oil revenues contributed 2/3 of state revenues,[33] oil only contributes about 9% to the GDP. Nigeria produces about 2.7% of the world's oil supply. Although the petroleum sector is important, as Nigeria's government revenues still heavily rely on this sector, it remains a small part of the country's overall economy. The largely subsistence agricultural sector has not kept up with the country's rapid population growth. Nigeria was once a large net exporter of food, but currently imports some of its food products. Mechanization has led to a resurgence in the manufacturing and exporting of food products, and there was consequently a move towards food sufficiency.[34] In 2006, Nigeria came to an agreement with the Paris Club to buy back the bulk of its owed debts from them, in exchange for a cash payment of roughly US$12 billion.[35]",
            "The problem with this new reality is that guaranteed revenue made possible by the agreement between the federal government and international oil companies become vanishingly smaller, thus leaving the federal government with fewer resources to meet its obligations. And because existing social institutions lack adequate regulatory capacity, Nigerians now in possession of oil producing wells either sell off their allocations to other prospecting firms or form what passes as oil producing companies that quickly perfect the act of lifting crude oil and shipping it abroad for sale to foreign refineries. The foreign refineries in turn would either ship back to Nigeria refined oil products at exorbitant cost to the federal government for domestic distribution at highly subsidized prices to consumers, or the refined oil is sold in the international market to any buyer. Either way, Nigeria loses its share of revenue from the initial crude extraction, and pays for the imported refined product with revenue from established international companies still operating in the Upstream sector. Put quite simply, the allocated oil wells to indigenous firms or Nigerians generate windfall profits that remain in private hands, and since private Nigerians seldom pay taxes, federal and state governments are thus deprived of an essential source of revenue. And so are the average citizens."

Instead, it is stated that Trump inherited a strengthening economy, with the unemployment rate at about 85 percent capacity, indicating a relatively decent trending economy. Furthermore, the claim that Trump rebuilt the economy in three years is disputed, as it is argued that the economy's growth is now at roughly the same level as when he inherited it from the Obama administration. Additionally, the Trump administration's policies, such as the tax cut and trade wars, have been criticized for being fiscally irresponsible and hurting certain sectors of the economy.
