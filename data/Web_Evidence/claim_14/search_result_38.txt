The newly elected president of Africa’s biggest democracy is a former military dictator and political prisoner who once waged a draconian “war against indiscipline” but now insists he is a born-again democrat.
Muhammadu Buhari, a 72-year-old Muslim, managed to persuade Nigerians he is a reformed character who respects civil liberties yet still wields enough of an iron fist to beat corruption and the insurgency by the Islamist militants Boko Haram.
His first spell in power was a generation ago in a very different, pre-internet era, when democracy had a less steady foothold on the continent. Buhari, who was the petroleum affairs minister in the 1970s, ousted the elected president Shehu Shagari on New Year’s Eve in 1983 and ruled a military government until 27 August 1985.
The strongman sent soldiers to the streets with whips to enforce traffic regulations and ensure commuters formed orderly queues at bus stops. Civil servants arriving late to offices were forced to perform frog squats. Tens of thousands of immigrants from other west African nations were expelled.
Around 500 politicians, officials and businessmen were imprisoned in a populist campaign against waste and corruption. Critics of the regime, including the Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti, were also put behind bars. Buhari passed laws allowing indefinite detention without trial and imposed a decree to restrict press freedom, under which two journalists were jailed. The execution of three young men, retrospectively convicted of drug trafficking, led to an international outcry.
The war against indiscipline was carried to “sadistic levels, glorying in the humiliation of a people,” wrote the Nobel laureate for literature Wole Soyinka.
In one bizarre episode, Buhari fell out with Britain, the former colonial power, after attempting to smuggle Shagari’s former adviser Umaru Dikko from London to Lagos. Dikko, who had fled to the UK after the coup, was found drugged in a crate at Stansted.
As part of anti-graft measures, Buhari also ordered that the currency be replaced, forcing all holders of old notes to exchange them at banks within a limited period. Prices rose while living standards sank, leading to a palace coup by the general Ibrahim Babangida. Buhari was overthrown and imprisoned for 40 months.
After the restoration of democracy in 1999, Buhari fought and lost three elections, including in 2011 against Goodluck Jonathan of the dominant Peoples Democratic party (PDP). Yet when four opposition parties merged last year to form the All Progressives Congress (APC), it offered Buhari, from Daura in Katsina state in the largely Muslim north, a second crack at Jonathan, who is from the predominantly Christian south.
His campaign drew huge crowds with people many wielding brooms, the party symbol. The former army general, now wearing traditional robes and thick-framed spectacles, worked hard to bury his reputation. He said: “Before you is a former military ruler and a converted democrat who is ready to operate under democratic norms and is subjecting himself to the rigours of democratic elections for the fourth time.”
Buhari made bold promises such as the introduction of universal health care. However, his past also came back to haunt him, including statements in the 1980s that he would bring in sharia law across Nigeria. A moderate form of sharia was introduced in the majority-Muslim northern states in the 1990s, but it operates alongside secular courts.
Sceptics warned that he could return to his autocratic ways and human rights abuses. Sonnie Ekwowusi, an editorial board member and a columnist at the This Day newspaper, said: “I voted for Jonathan because of fear of going to the unknown. Nobody seems to know what Buhari has up his sleeve. He can spring a surprise like taking Nigeria under sharia law.“I think once a dictator, always a dictator. He’s tried to be a born-again democrat but we have not seen that in his utterances. Many people are afraid that if he wins, they will go to prison.”
Others weary of corruption under Jonathan’s administration argued that Buhari’s austerity is exactly what Nigeria needs. His military background was seen as an asset in the fight against Boko Haram, which has killed at least 10,000 people since 2009 and kidnapped 276 schoolgirls from Chibok last year. Buhari, an ethnic Fulani, escaped an apparent assassination attempt by the group when his convoy was attacked in Kaduna last July.
But Bola Tinubu, the national leader of the ACP and a former governor of Lagos, said: “I think leaders must take responsibility, not like Jonathan today, who says he has never done anything wrong – he will give you excuses for why, blame it on somebody else. Buhari has taken responsibility for that and apologised that he did that as a military dictator.
“He has now demonstrated that he is a converted born-again democrat. Why? He has contested the presidential election three times and lost, and ended up in court. So that is the demonstration of commitment to the rule of law. What else? He has clearly stated that he cannot change the past, who he was a professional, being a soldier, then a dictator, but he could change the present and better manage the future.”
