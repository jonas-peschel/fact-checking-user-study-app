NEW: Weeks Away from End of Fiscal Year, Trump is Blocking $410+ Billion Dollars in Funding Owed to Communities Nationwide
Murray, DeLauro release updated tally of federal funds Trump has unlawfully cancelled or frozen—hurting families across the country
Billions of dollars in funding that’s held up is set to expire at month’s end unless action is taken—including for K-12 schools, farmers, and medical research
***VIEW UPDATED TRACKER HERE***
Washington, D.C. — Today, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (D-CT-03), Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, released updated information detailing at least $410 billion in federal funding that President Trump and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought are holding up and denying communities across the country.
The updated tracker chronicles how Trump and Vought are brazenly violating federal laws to deny families, farmers, small businesses, and communities across America resources that they are counting on—and that Congress has delivered for them.
In a statement, Senator Murray and Congresswoman DeLauro said:
“We are now nine months into the year—and weeks away from the end of the fiscal year—and President Trump and Russ Vought continue to withhold hundreds of billions of dollars from families, farmers, children, small businesses, and communities in every part of the country.
“While Republicans passed a bill to take away health care coverage from more than 15 million people, including seniors, and to cause a million kids to go hungry, President Trump and Russ Vought have been stealing resources promised to working Americans in every part of the country. They are cheating families all while giving big corporations and billionaires trillions of dollars in new tax breaks.
“As the courts and a key nonpartisan watchdog have repeatedly concluded, this administration’s disregard for our nation’s spending laws and Congress’ power of the purse has touched every corner of our country. Children in elementary schools have been denied resources they need to succeed, farmers and rural communities have been left to fend for themselves, and communities have been robbed of resources to keep people safe. President Trump and Russ Vought have stripped hope away from cancer patients and single-handedly decided to make the cost-of-living crisis even worse for working families.
“Republicans have total control in Washington—and total control of whether Americans will receive the funding they are promised. Trump and Vought need to stop blocking these investments, and Republicans need to join us in insisting that every last dollar flows—particularly the billions of dollars in funding that will otherwise expire at month’s end.
“We stand ready to fund the government in a bipartisan way—and to pass funding bills that address the cost-of-living crisis that President Trump is making worse by the day. Any funding agreement must reflect Democratic priorities, and we must pass full-year spending bills that ensure lawmakers—not Donald Trump and Russ Vought—decide how taxpayer dollars get spent.”
Among much else, the tracker details how President Trump and Russ Vought have frozen, cancelled, clawed back, illegally impounded, and slow-walked federal funding for:
- K-12 schools across the country to train teachers and improve student outcomes.
- Critical NIH research into Alzheimer's disease, women's health, cancer, diabetes, and much more—throwing research already conducted into the shredder and setting back lifesaving treatments and cures.
- Mental health services and substance use treatment.
- Public safety, including COPS grants, Office of Violence Against Women grants, programs to help victims of crime, and resources to prevent family violence.
- Farmers and rural communities, cutting off resources thousands of small agriculture businesses depend on to make a living and grow local food systems and economies.
- Communities to tackle homelessness and help seniors, young Americans, and other vulnerable groups keep a roof over their heads.
- College and higher education, including resources to improve education outcomes for rural college students and funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI), and Tribal colleges.
- Important improvements to weather forecasting abilities, and preparedness funding and relief for states and communities responding to and recovering from natural disasters.
- Preschool and early childhood education programs and facilities.
- VA hospitals, jeopardizing veterans’ safety and care at VA facilities.
- Critical investments in transportation projects—for roads and bridges, airports, public transit, ports, and more—and in energy projects across the country that are creating new, good jobs and lowering families’ monthly energy bills.
- Our national security and efforts to combat international fentanyl and narcotics trade, human trafficking, and other crimes across the globe, and to prevent and end global conflicts.
- Essential health services like birth control and cancer screenings for over 800,000 patients across 22 states—and resources to protect people from public health threats.
New Updates
Senator Murray and Congresswoman DeLauro first released the tracker in April, exposing how President Trump was blocking at least $430 billion in federal funding. In June, they released another update, cataloging over $425 billion in blocked funds.
Today’s update details how, despite months of vowing they were merely conducting a “programmatic review” of funding, the Trump administration continues to withhold a vast array of investments promised to communities across the country.
Since the last update in June, some funding has been released in the face of public outcry—and a number of investments that were being blocked have since been rescinded through Republicans’ reconciliation bill and President Trump’s rescissions package. This funding is no longer listed in the tracker.
Since June, however, it has also become clear that a variety of programs that, in a typical year, would already have long gotten funds out the door have not moved any funding for fiscal year 2025—and in many cases, have not so much as opened applications for funding. These programs are now listed on the tracker, as the Trump administration blocks critical funds at the tail end of the fiscal year, and in many cases, risks unlawfully letting those investments expire come October 1.
About the Tracker
The tracker offers a snapshot-in-time look at the vast array of federal funding that should be going out the door, but that President Trump—in an unprecedented, illegal scheme—is holding up or actively fighting in court to block.
The tracker is not exhaustive—but catalogs a wide range of investments that this administration is stealing. Compiled by the Democratic staffs of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the tracker details the minimum amount of federal funding the Committees believe the administration is currently freezing, cancelling, or fighting in court to block. It does not detail tens of billions of dollars in funding that President Trump has previously frozen but finally allowed to flow—and it cannot measure the incredible cost of President Trump’s illegal funding freezes to American families, businesses, and communities.
In some instances, there are programs and priorities listed in the tracker that courts have ordered the Trump administration to release—rebuking President Trump’s unprecedented assault on our spending laws and Congress’ power of the purse. Funding for those programs is listed in cases in which the Trump administration is actively fighting in court to continue blocking the funds—particularly because any relief provided by the courts at this stage is temporary and because this administration has over the last several months—whether through intentional defiance or sheer incompetence—repeatedly failed to get funding to its intended recipients even when ordered by a court to do so.
In addition to flagrantly violating our nation’s spending laws, President Trump and Russ Vought are also taking every step they can to hide what they are doing from the American people. Despite repeatedly vowing to have the “most transparent administration in history,” President Trump has led an administration that has systematically obscured its spending actions, failed to provide responses to oversight requests from Congress, refused to answer basic questions from the press, taken down a key website that OMB is required to publicly post spending decisions on in clear defiance of the law until unanimously ordered by a circuit court to restore it, and failed to submit detailed plans to the Appropriations Committees showing how this administration is spending fiscal year 2025 funding, as required by law. The unprecedented lack of transparency and responsiveness makes tracking what funding is being blocked all the more difficult, and it remains the Trump administration's responsibility to not only begin to follow our spending laws but to explain its actions to date.
The updated database, which captures funding held up as of September 8, can be found on the Senate and House Appropriations Committees’ websites.
