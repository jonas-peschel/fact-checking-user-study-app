Abstract
Muhammadu Buhari was the seventh Head of Government of an independent Nigeria, serving then as a Military Head of State— and is also the current President of a democratic Nigeria, hence the fifteenth “number one citizen” of the Federal Republic. President Muhammadu Buhari was born, 17 December 1942, in a halcyon country side of Daura (to the family of Adamu and Zulaihat) in the present day Katsina State of Nigeria. But as fate would have it, this twenty-third child of Adamu lost his dear father at a rather tender age of four. Although Buhari lost his father at such an early age in life, the hand of destiny never left him to fall by the way side— to be consigned to the dustbin of oblivion. And so it was that under the sponsorship of a “foresighted” determined mother, the forthright Muhammadu Buhari obtained formal education at different times at his native home town of Daura— and also Mai’adua. It is on record that he attended Katsina Model School in 1953, and then Katsina Provincial Secondary School (now Government College Katsina) between 1956 and 1961. Any story told about Buhari will never be complete without mentioning the very fact that this man who prefers to live a low-profile or rather reserved life-style had a glorious Military career, spanning decades of dedicated service to father-land.

On 29 May 2015, General Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in as the President of Nigeria. The Buhari-led administration is expected to urgently tackle several challenges that have hindered economic prosperity, sustainable security and overall national development in Nigeria. These challenges include but are not limited to terrorism, violent conflicts, widespread poverty, youth unemployment, electricity shortage, and corruption. For President Muhammadu Buhari to make a success of his avowed intentions to bring the change that Nigeria needs, he must put in place the right policies, programmes and personnel.

This research paper provided a comparative analysis of foreign policy of Nigeria under Muhammadu Buhari's military regime 1983-1985 and his current civilian administration which started in May 2015. Foreign policy is a set of tools or activities developed by states to drive its interest in the international system, and internal and external factors usually influence this. The personality and environment of which leaders assumes leadership also plays an important in defining a state foreign policy. The objective of this paper is to provide a comparative analysis of Buhari's foreign policy under his military and civilian administration. The research utilizes secondary data from journals, books, newspapers, government reports among others. The findings of the study shows the under Buhari's military administration relations between Nigeria and ECOWAS was hostile which led to border closures, relations with Nigeria's former colonial master, United Kingdom was also strained due which resulted to diplomatic rows between both countries, the Buhari administration also continued with Afrocentric policy with continuous call for end to apartheid and colonialism on the continent. While under his civilian government Buhari was able to create friendly relations with ECOWAS member nations, maintained good relations with UK and US, and improve the countries relations with China to improve the country's economy. The paper concludes that the type of government and environment in the international system with which Buhari served played a role in shaping the foreign policy direction of the state.
The United States of America (U.S.A.) is a traditional ally of Nigeria. And given that she is a major world power her diplomatic exertions have had significant implications for both Nigeria's domestic and external relations, especially now that Nigeria is besotted by a plethora of security, democratic, and development challenges. It is against this backdrop that we underscore the recent visit of Nigeria's President Mohammadu Buhari to the U.S.A. on a four-days working visit. This paper reviews this visit. Specifically, it looks at the reason(s) for the visit, the major issues that were discussed, the benefits and criticisms of the visit, and very importantly, the implications of the visit on Nigeria's contemporary international relations.
Nigerian Political Leaders is a collection of comprehensive and well-researched essays on selected political leaders, both civilian and military written by notable scholars. While many leaders have ruled Nigeria since 1960, not all have made significant contributions to good governance and nation building. Because of leadership challenges, the search for sustainable democracy and political stability has been quite elusive. These problems have been compounded by the vastness of the country as well as its multi-ethnic composition, religious divide, and the recurrent intervention of the military in politics. Thus, the result has been an unending difficulty in establishing a workable political schema for an enduring unity. Given the series of political and religious disturbances, civil war, economic meltdown, plundering of national resources, and frequent change of government, are Nigerians as a people simply ungovernable or is poor governance the result of the failure of leadership? These are some of the questions that this book addresses.

Muhammadu Buhari has had two distinct regime types in Nigeria, military and civilian, which have had their implications for the country's development trajectory. During his military regime, Buhari implemented austere economic policies and fought corruption, but his government was criticized for human rights abuses, which negatively impacted Nigeria's development trajectory. However, his focus on tackling corruption laid the foundation for better governance in subsequent years. In his civilian regime, Buhari has prioritized infrastructure development, social welfare programs, and diversifying Nigeria's economy beyond oil. Nonetheless, his record on security issues has been criticized particularly after the outbreak of insurgency in the Northeast region of the country. Overall, the implications of Buhari's policies and governance approach have been mixed, and this study highlights the challenges and opportunities of his tenure for Nigeria's development aspirations, particularly in the areas of growth, governance, and human rights.

Using the individual level of analysis, and the almost 40 related speeches of Muhammadu Buhari, this paper comparatively examines the supervision of Nigeria’s foreign policy by the present government of Nigeria up to December 2016. The comparative parallels are the foreign policies of Brazil, related developing countries, as well as General Buhari’s foreign policy between 1983 and1985. Against the hypothesis that what is unfolding in Nigeria’s international relations is the doctrine of Buharism, this study aspires to reveal: what principles of international theory best explains Nigeria’s external behavior during the period; the real and apparent reasons for the adoption of these actions; the paradoxes in the execution of this foreign policy so far; the purposes of these foreign policy actions; the possible nature of these foreign policy actions at the expiration of President Buhari’s tenure; and the unfolding and long term effects of Nigeria’s emerging foreign policy posture.
The paper explores the nucleus of what exactly constitutes Nigeria’s Foreign Policy or the Foreign Policy posture of Nigeria under General Muhammadu Buhari’s Military Regime. It explains the environment within which Nigerian Foreign Policies were formulated especially during the military regimes. The paper also examines the sum total of what led to Nigeria taking the foreign policy position during the period under review and the consequences thereafter. Though, the Buhari’s regime was greeted with a lot of outcry both within and outside Nigeria, because of the radical approach it took, the paper points out the benefits and achievements it recorded for the country. However, we also conceptualise the concept of Foreign Policy and its objective within Nigeria and within the global system. For a thorough analysis, we adopted the Elite Theory to explain how some few elements within the society manipulate and utilise power either for their own use or for the generality of the people they govern. Hence, we tried to situate the Military Elites in Nigeria within the context of Elitism, as "the selected few or the minority whose values predominated in the society”. At the end, a critique of the Buhari’s Foreign Policy dimension was offered and recommendations as the alternatives were also given. Keywords: Foreign Policy, Military Regime, International system, Diplomacy, Ambassador.
Former President Buhari's ascendancy to office of the President was partly attributed to electoral reforms introduced by Jega-led INEC between 2010-2015. These reforms include, a fairly credible voter register, Smart Card Reader for electronic voter accreditation and a truly independent electoral commission. The former President attested to the centrality of these reforms in defining his electoral fortune in the 2015 elections. In his words, "When the time He (God) had set for me came, He used technology to bring me in,". His testimony underscores the power of electoral technology in deepening electoral integrity.

Much of what is known about the late Nigerian President, Umaru Musa ‘Yaradua, who died on May 5 2010, was his two and half years as the president of Nigeria. During the period, and despite the global recession and the season of uncertainty that followed it, the Nigerian economy was growing, and the citizens were better off. Before becoming the president, ‘Yaradua was the Governor of Katsina state in northwest Nigeria. Little was known about him as a governor due principally to his philosophy: ‘what you do judges you more than what you say’. What he did in the eight years as the governor was adjudged as one of the best performances in Nigeria, an achievement that endeared him to his party leaders and that influenced his choice as the party's presidential flag-bearer. This presentation highlights some of the achievements of ‘Yaradua, the governor, including his austere lifestyle, his prudence in government and how he was able to transform the state from a non-performing to one of the top-performing states. A mixed method analysis including document review, ethnography and interview were adopted for the study. As the author was a member of the state cabinet, the recollection of experiences during cabinet meetings, especially, before major decisions were taken and direct talks with the governor on some government policies shaped the opinion presented. It is hoped that leaders at both the levels of government will learn from ‘Yaradua's style of leadership. Keywords: Pro-poor policies, Governance, ‘Yaradua, Presidential Villa, Katsina state,
