The bill proposed giving the president trade promotion authority (TPA). TPA, also known as fast track authority, allows the president to negotiate trade deals that cannot be amended by Congress. Congress casts a simple up or down vote on a trade agreement, and the legislation only requires a simple majority for approval. The bill also included a statement of trade priorities and provisions for trade adjustment assistance. Paul voted with three other Republican senators against the bill.[130][131]
2016 Budget proposalOn May 5, 2015, the Senate voted to approve SConRes11, a congressional budget proposal for fiscal year 2016, by a vote of 51-48.

The second version of the $607 billion national defense bill included "$5 billion in cuts to match what was approved in the budget" and language preventing the closure of the Guantanamo Bay military prison.[138][139] Paul and five Republicans did not vote.[140] On November 5, 2015, the House passed the bill by a vote of 370-58, and President Barack Obama signed it into law on November 25, 2015.[141] On June 18, 2015, the Senate passed HR 1735 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 by a vote of 71-25. The bill "authorizes FY2016 appropriations and sets forth policies for Department of Defense (DOD) programs and activities, including military personnel strengths. It does not provide budget authority, which is provided in subsequent appropriations legislation." Paul voted with one Republican, 22 Democrats and one Independent against the bill.[142] The House passed the bill on May 15, 2015.[143] President Barack Obama vetoed the bill on October 22, 2015.[144] 2015 budgetOn October 30, 2015, the Senate passed HR 1314 - Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 by a vote of 64-35.

The bill required President Barack Obama to submit the details of the nuclear deal with Iran for congressional review. Congress had 60 days to review the deal and vote to approve, disapprove or take no action on the deal. During the review period, sanctions on Iran could not be lifted. Paul voted with 52 other Republican senators to approve the bill. Senator Tom Cotton (Ark.) was the only Republican who voted against the bill.[148][149]
DomesticUSA FREEDOM Act of 2015On June 2, 2015, the Senate passed HR 2048 - the Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective Discipline Over Monitoring Act of 2015 or the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 by a vote of 67-32. The legislation revised HR 3199 - the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 by terminating the bulk collection of metadata under Sec. 215 of the act, requiring increased reporting from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and requiring the use of "a specific selection term as the basis for national security letters that request information from wire or electronic communication service providers, financial institutions, or consumer reporting agencies."

The bill proposed withholding federal funding from "sanctuary jurisdictions" that violate the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and other federal immigration laws. In addition, the bill proposed increasing "penalties for individuals who illegally reenter the United States after being removed" and providing "liability protection for State and local law enforcement who cooperate with Federal law enforcement."[161] Paul voted with 51 Republicans and two Democrats in favor of proceeding to the bill.[162] 113th CongressThe second session of the 113th Congress enacted into law 224 out of the 3215 introduced bills (7 percent). Comparatively, the 112th Congress had 4.2 percent of introduced bills enacted into law in the second session.[163] The Senate confirmed 13,949 out of 18,323 executive nominations received (76.1 percent). For more information pertaining to Paul's voting record in the 113th Congress, please see the below sections.[164] National securityCommittee vote on Syria
On September 4, 2013, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee narrowly approved an authorization for President Obama to use limited force against Syria. It was approved by a 10-7 vote.[165][166] The vote came after a three-hour briefing with top Obama administration officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry and James Clapper, the director of national intelligence.[165] Of the nine Democratic members and eight Republican members that make up the committee, seven Democrats and three Republicans voted in favor, while five Republicans and two Democrats opposed the authorization.[165] A single "present" vote was cast by Ed Markey (D). Paul was one of the five Republicans who opposed the authorization.[167] EconomyFarm billOn February 4, 2014, the Democratic controlled Senate approved the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013, H.R. 2642, also known as the Farm Bill.[168] It passed the Senate with a vote of 68-32. The nearly 1,000-page bill reformed and continued various programs of the Department of Agriculture through 2018. The $1 trillion bill expanded crop insurance for farmers by $7 billion over the next decade and created new subsidies for rice and peanut growers that will kick in when prices drop; however, cuts to the food stamp program cut an average of $90 per month for 1.7 million people in 15 states.[169] Paul voted with 22 other Republican senators against the bill. 2014 BudgetOn January 16, 2014, the Democratic-controlled Senate approved H.R. 3547, a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September 30, 2014.[170][171] The Senate voted 72-26 for the 1,582 page bill, with 17 Republicans and 55 Democrats voting in favor of the bill.[171] The omnibus package included 12 annual spending bills to fund federal operations.[172] It increased the paychecks of federal workers and military personnel by 1 percent, increased Head Start funding for early childhood education by $1 billion, reduced funding to the Internal Revenue Service and the Environmental Protection Agency, and left the Affordable Care Act without any drastic cuts. Paul voted with 25 other Republican members against the bill.[170][171] Government shutdown
During the shutdown in October 2013, the Senate rejected, down party lines, every House-originated bill that stripped the budget of funding for the Affordable Care Act. A deal was reached late on October 16, 2013, just hours before the debt ceiling deadline. The bill to reopen the government, H.R. 2775, lifted the $16.7 trillion debt limit and funded the government through January 15, 2014. Federal employees also received retroactive pay for the shutdown period. The only concession made by Senate Democrats was to require income verification for Obamacare subsidies.[173] The final vote on H.R. 2775 was 81-18, with all 18 votes against the bill from Republican members. Paul voted with the Republican Party against the bill.[174] Statement on government shutdown
After the government shutdown went into effect, Paul said on October 1, 2013, that he would support a short-term funding measure “to keep the government open while we negotiate.”[175] “I think what we could do is pass a very short term, maybe not six weeks, but what about one week, so we could negotiate over a week," Paul said. "I think a continuing bill to keep the government open while we negotiate is a good idea. I do agree that negotiating with the government closed probably to [Democrats] appears like strong-arm tactics.”[175] “I think if we did it for a week or two, we could still continue to negotiate, have a conference committee and really I think the American people do want us to work this out,” Paul added.[175] No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013Paul voted against H.R.325 -- No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013. The bill passed the Senate on January 31, 2013, with a vote of 64 - 34. The purpose of the bill was to temporarily suspend the debt ceiling and withhold the pay of members of Congress until a budget could be passed. The vote largely followed party lines with Democrats overwhelmingly supporting it and many Republicans in opposition to the bill.[176] Paul Ryan Budget ProposalIn March 2013 the U.S. Senate soundly rejected a balanced budget plan by House Budget Committee chair Paul Ryan (R).[177] Five Republicans joined every Democrat present to kill the measure, which failed on a 40-59 vote.[177] Paul was one of the five Senate Republicans who voted against Ryan's budget proposal.[177] The proposed budget would have cut about $5 trillion over the next decade and aimed to balance the budget by the end of the 10-year period.[178] Some tea party members of the GOP opposed the measure because of its reliance on $600 billion-plus in tax revenues on the wealthy enacted in January 2013, in order to balance the budget.[177] Others in the Senate opposed the Ryan plan because of cuts from safety net programs for the poor and the inclusion of a plan to turn the Medicare program for the elderly into a voucher-like system for future beneficiaries born in 1959 or later.[177] ImmigrationMexico-U.S. borderPaul voted for Senate Amendment 1197 -- Requires the Completion of the Fence Along the United States-Mexico Border. The amendment was rejected by the Senate on June 18, 2013, with a vote of 39 - 54. The purpose of the amendment was to require the completion of 350 miles of fence described in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 before registered provisional immigrant status may be granted. It would also require 700 miles of fence be completed before the status of registered provisional immigrants may be changed to permanent resident status. The vote followed party lines.[176] Social issuesViolence Against Women (2013)Paul voted against S.47 -- Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. The bill was passed by the Senate on February 12, 2013, with a vote of 78 - 22. The purpose of the bill was to combat violence against women, from domestic violence to international trafficking in persons. All 22 dissenting votes were cast by Republicans.[176] Previous congressional sessionsFiscal CliffPaul voted against the fiscal cliff compromise bill, which made permanent most of the Bush tax cuts originally passed in 2001 and 2003 while also raising tax rates on the highest income levels. He was one of five Republicans that voted against the bill. The bill was passed in the Senate by an 89 - 8 vote on January 1, 2013.[179] |

He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person."[207]

Assaulted by neighbor
On November 3, 2017, while Paul was mowing his lawn, he was assaulted outside of his Bowling Green, Kentucky, home by his neighbor, Rene Bousher. Kentucky state police arrested Bousher and charged him with one count of assault in the fourth degree. Under Kentucky law at the time of Boucher's arrest, assault in the fourth degree in Kentucky was a Class A misdemeanor and carried a penalty of either a $500 fine, a maximum term of 12 months in prison, or both.[208][209][210][211][212]
After the attack, a spokesperson for Paul said, "Senator Paul was blindsided and the victim of an assault. ...The assailant was arrested and it is now a matter for the police. Senator Paul is fine."[208]
On November 5, 2018, Paul's chief of staff released an updated statement on Paul's condition, saying, "Senator Paul has five rib fractures including three displaced fractures. ... This type of injury is caused by high velocity severe force. It is not clear exactly how soon he will return to work, as the pain is considerable as is the difficulty in getting around, including flying. ... Senator Paul and Kelley appreciate everyone’s thoughts and well wishes and he will be back fighting for liberty in the Senate soon." Paul also had bruises on his lungs caused by the broken ribs.[208][213]
In the criminal case against Boucher, he was required to serve a 30-day prison sentence after pleading guilty to assaulting a member of Congress. Boucher also was fined $10,000 and required to serve 100 hours of community service. On January 30, 2019, Paul was awarded more than $580,000 in damages and medical expenses.[214]
On January 30, 2019, Paul wrote in a tweet, "This lawsuit wasn’t about me. It was about all of us and what we find acceptable as a society. We need to send a clear message that violence is not the answer - anytime, anywhere. We can hold different views, whether it’s politics, religion or day to day matters."[214]
Patriot Act filibuster
On May 20, 2015, Paul conducted a nearly 11-hour filibuster of the renewal of provisions in the USA PATRIOT ACT. Paul specifically argued against the mass collection of metadata by the National Security Agency and warrantless wiretapping. He asked Senate leadership to allow members of Congress to debate reauthorizing the USA PATRIOT ACT and propose amendments to HR 2048 - the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015, rather than simply casting an up or down vote on the legislation.
Letter to Iran
On March 9, 2015, Senator Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) wrote a letter to Iran's leadership, warning them that signing a nuclear deal with the Obama administration without congressional approval constituted only an executive agreement. The letter also stated that "The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time." The letter was signed by 47 Republican members of the Senate. Paul was one of the 47 who signed the letter. No Democrats signed it.[215]
Members of the Obama administration and of Congress reacted to the letter.[216] Vice President Joe Biden said of the letter, "In thirty-six years in the United States Senate, I cannot recall another instance in which senators wrote directly to advise another country — much less a longtime foreign adversary — that the president does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them."[217]
Syria
Paul submitted an opinion editorial to CNN on August 29, 2013, in which he urged President Barack Obama not to rush into a war in Syria, saying, "America's wars must be debated by Congress, declared constitutionally and fought only for the interests and security of the United States. They should never be fought to save face."[218]
Drone policies filibuster
On March 6, 2013, Paul led a filibuster of President Obama's CIA Director nominee, John Brennan, that lasted 12 hours and 52 minutes.[219] In addition to delaying the final vote on Brennan's confirmation, Paul's stated intention was to highlight his concerns about the Obama Administration's drone policies.[219]
NSA surveillance
In June 2013, The Guardian reported about a secret surveillance program where the NSA obtained phone records of millions of customers.[220] Paul considered a class-action lawsuit against the National Security Agency over the large-scale surveillance program that was gathering data on American citizens. Paul also said he would consider taking it to the Supreme Court.[221][222] Paul called the NSA surveillance program an "astounding assault on the Constitution."[223]
Obamacare
Senators Ted Cruz, Paul and Mike Lee, who led calls in the Senate to defund Obamacare in any spending bills, took part in a September 10, 2013, "Exempt America from Obamacare" event, organized by Tea Party Patriots and ForAmerica, along with other conservative groups.[224]
"Democrats will stop at nothing to protect the president’s signature legislation, and too many Republicans are afraid to fight," rally organizers wrote. The rally came after 80 House members signed a letter in August 2013, calling on Congress to defund the health care law in upcoming fiscal battles.[224]
