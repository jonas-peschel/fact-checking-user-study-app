Joe Ganem Believes His Life Experience Will Matter to Voters
Joe Ganem had never run for elected office before his decision to tackle the Long Beach First District City Council seat. He’s helped other people’s efforts for office including being a campaign manager. His decision came after attending a candidate forum this past summer.
“Frankly, I felt like the district needed more depth, more history with people that…like myself, that I was seeing on stage.”
Candidate Joe Ganem believes he brings that depth and history to his campaign. That campaign points to a long list of experiences and accomplishments including “service as a police officer, city administrator, homebuilder and land developer, trade and environmental association executive, and governmental affairs representative at state and federal levels.” For Ganem, the experience of knowing how government works matters.
“… you’re in a better position to make decisions on the Council for the best approach for the future.’
PalacioMagazine.com interviewed Joe Ganem at his Long Beach Boulevard campaign headquarters about that experience, a list of district priorities, and his solutions for the challenges facing the First District in Long Beach.

Candidate Vision Statement
“Over the past 20 years, District One has been controlled by a political machine that has kept voter turnout low and used it as an easy springboard to elect someone to higher office. Meanwhile, the District has experienced extensive problems in the lack of affordable housing, increased homelessness, pollution, and crime. My experience as a police officer, city manager, builder, environmental lobbyist, homeless commissioner, and community activist will serve the District well in resolving these issues. I will not run for higher office and only want the best for District One. Trust me to be an independent voice for you. I will appreciate your vote on November 5th.
