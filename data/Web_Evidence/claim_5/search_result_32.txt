| Student (Anonymous),Alliance University,"Bengaluru makes a big difference as a spot for engineering. At times you have workshops accessible to yourself and I think that's a perk. So, if you're not getting your preferred branch in a Government College of something like BITS, go for the city. Also, self development is always the only thing.Pretty good companies visit the college, not the tech giants though. If you're okay with TATA and Infosys and all, that's upto you. The perk of being in Bengaluru is there are off-campus opportunities and fairs where if you're skilled, you'll probably thrive well.",7.2 | |

There are various societies like that of fine arts music literature drama and so on there are technical societies event for coding as well as for electronic enthusiast. Students are quite active in the societies during the fest time. where is workshops are held from time to time by the societies for the benefit of students. the student diversity is quite great here. There are various students coming from all over the country as well as there are students from some other countries even like that of Maldives Australia etc. the students are there from quite different between grounds like that of economic as well as political as well as religion.

| Arshad Iqbal,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT],"Several companies come for placements but mostly large number of students gets placed in mass recuriter companies only like TCS, Infosys, etc. Compnies put GPA as their first criteria then number of tests and interview rounds are there. According to college they provide 100% placement but in my view almost 80% students gets placed mostly from CSE branch. College prepare the students for placements from 1st semester only by including courses like english, STS, humanities, etc. Faculties here are nice and helpful except few who are very strict. All of them are hioghly qualified and teaches nicely. Some teachers give their very best but usind nice slides and video lectures to make students take lectures with good intrest. Many teacher take students for industrial visits also and show them the practical use of the course which he/she is teaching. ",7.3 | |

And i didn't choose it specifically, i just got it on basis of my rank. But it also has some good points i would like to mention. It is a good institute to join for a career in CSE if you have a decent rank in JEE Mains, far better than joining any other private colleges where peer group is not good because of direct admission available by paying a big amount. Also, the coding culture is far better than other new IIITs. It has been independently functioning without much help from it's mentor institute (DAIICT). Also, the fee structure is quite lower than many other IIITs.",6.7 | |

| Akshay harishchandra aglawe,Progressive Education Society's Modern College of Engineering - [MCOE],"In my class 25% students were girls which is quite normal for electrical engineering branch in our country. but 80% of our Lecturers were female. almost 95 % classmates were Maharashtrian. A small village guy coming into metro city like Pune I was bit afraid of ragging culture like they show in movies but it was completely opposite here I hardly faced any discrimination due to my dark skin or my cast. and here girls were less in number but they were treated equally most of girls would mix with boys and participate in every activity with High enthusiasm. ethnicity, race, gender, economical status, politics were secondary things. Yeah but there was never discussion on sexual orientation which shows total ignorance towards LGBT community there need to more awareness about this topic so our youth can openly discuss such things. During my time not even single core electrical company visited our college. as I remember only 2 IT companies(1)TCS 2) NTT DATA) visited our campus with placement of only 2 students from whole class!! (but now I hear good things from my juniors that many core companies along with IT companies are visiting our college campus and which have led to significant rise in placements). Steps for recruitment were usual. criteria to be eligible for drives was to have aggregate of 60%. and then you will have face to aptitude test then interview. Till our batch placement percentage was very low (just 5 to 8%). there was hardly any guidance related to placement to students.

| Shikha Singh,Chandigarh University - [CU],"It was a memorable experience here, with young and energetic faculty, who had an amazing rapport with us students. The faculty here not only taught us the curricula, but also taught us the things that go beyond studies, they helped us shape as who we are today. The faculty of Chandigarh University encourages both studies and extra-curricular activities, which go hand-in-hand towards getting top placement offers, because the companied demand not only the theoretical knowledge, but also other skills, which students can learn through participation in extra-curriculars. A lot of teaching, a little bit of research, hands-on experiences and lots of extra-curriculars to help you develop as an all-rounder. The little fun activities and technical events in the department as well as outside CU campus, help take the minds off from the studies and refreshes you.Placement is best here.acedmics is also good and hostel food and rooms are suitable for the students.you are someone ambitious trying to push your limits by having a good environment around you, this university is simply place to be. Their advertisements regarding a conducive international environment is misleading at best, because of the xenophobic (more so racial) attitude that its inhabitants promote. Do not believe in any of their advertisements as they resort to boast irrationally to capitalize on its students’ misfortune. Some other important points Its not in Chandigarh! Rather thrown on the outskirts in the midst of green fields. Forget a good social life around the campus. Though the campus itself is big enough and has a lot of eateries",6.8 | |

That's what made my decision final.It depends on your branch. NSUT is known for its Coding based branches so if you are in a branch which promotes coding, you're set. So for CSE to MAC to ECE, you're settled since course, academics and faculties are too good. But for newer branches, (4 yr old ME) teachers do not know much plus the labs are not very much developed.

| Student (Anonymous),Netaji Subhas University of Technology - [NSUT],"It wasn't preplanned actually. My big brother got into DTU so my parents wanted to make a change and got myself admitted in NSUT. I personally didn't find any 'better' between these two. But trust me, student life or basically college life is slightly better in DTU :) Infrastructure is also better in DTU. The thing is DTU has been an university for a long time and NSUT just became university in late 2018. Mine is the first batch of 'NSUT'. My all seniors belong to 'NSIT'. I personally don't find anything too amusing inside the campus but I do like table tennis and also peri peri fries from McCain's canteen XD I opted the course because that's what I prepared for since class 11th.I have no complaints. Infrastructure is alright. Library is big enough (3 storeyed), various sports can be played, be it cricket, football, volleyball, basketball, table tennis, badminton and tennis maybe (which no one plays the) BUT NO SQUASH (I personally miss this because I used to love squash while I was in school). Labs are somewhat on the lower side. Especially computer labs Xd they run windows xp in 2020 but once you opt a course like mine, laptop is something which is kind of necessary. So are the equipments of electronics lab. Most of them are working but IT IS WHAT IT IS.",8.2 | |
| Student (Anonymous),Darbhanga College of Engineering - [DCE],"First it is a Government Engineering College which comes under Bihar Government and is Funded by World Bank under TEQIP-III scheme. Many Courses and Internships are organized by Bihar Government to develop skills in students. And the Fee of the college is very less. At the time of admission you will be charged Rs.2500 by the college and in 2nd, 3rd and 4th sem college will charge Rs 120 only for showing in Government Records and the University will charge you first time Registration Fee of Rs 2100 and Rs 6400 as Exam Fee every year for 4 years by the time you complete your Degree. So total fee college will cost you Rs.26080 in 4 years. A medium class family like my can afford the Fee of this college. If you can't afford the Fee you can get a loan from Bihar government under Bihar student Credit card scheme for Under Graduate students after getting admission, under this scheme you will get money for College Fee as well as Hostel Fee and money for buying books and for buying laptop under very low Rate of Interest. Many Students of my college have taken this loan.Darbhanga College of Engineering infrastructure is very good there is a big Football ground in which you may play football or cricket. It has library with lots of books for academic studies. Big Laboratories with lots of equipments are available here. And the main thing is the wifi which is very good in terms of speed and coverage. Our college has two wifi with different ISP one is Airtel's wifi with unlimited data access one can use it and it doesn't discriminate either you are a Airtel user or not one can use it very easily. And other is JIO Net wifi for which you will get ID and password from college with a data cap of 1gb per day and if you consumed your data you can't access wifi unless you have a Jio sim with a active pack in it because it charges from your normal recharged pack and speed is not good.",9.3 | |

| Soumyadip Mondal,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"A lot of alumni networks are almost as old as their alma maters. At the start, most of these associations were entirely voluntary, supported solely by individual alumni. Volunteers maintained mailing lists, collected dues to support activities, produced publications, organized events, and annual meetings. The world of Alumni Relations has come a long way since its inception in the early eighteenth-century. They became a vital part of most of the educational institutions now thanks to the efforts of many outstanding professionals in Alumni Relations. A good alumni network benefits the institution, current students, and as well as its Alumni. It is a win-win situation for everyone. I would like to conclude by saying that they are genuinely very helpful.Maintaining a positive relationship among students, teachers and the administrators creates a harmonious learning environment. When students are nurtured in such surroundings, they are likely to increase their intellectual accomplishments and learn more effectively. Cooperative engagement: Encourage cooperation and mutual support by getting learners to study collaboratively. When learners study in a group, they share their ideas and knowledge to complete an assignment. Support from the peer group also helps to boost learners’ confidence. Unlike learning in isolation where discouragement or a sense of hopelessness may set in, learning becomes more enjoyable when friends are able to help or motivate one another.",10 | |

| Abhishek Kumar,Gaya College of Engineering,"Many people believe that they, but that's not true. There actually are simple steps to dramatically reduce online tracking. Step 1. Download DuckDuckGo on all your devices | |
| With just one download you'll get tracker blocking, private searching, increased encrypting, and privacy grading on all of your browsing. Our mobile app for / (DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser) and browser extensions for, and (DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials) has all of this in one seamless package. Step 2. Update your software | |
| Your device operating systems get out-of-date over time, and old software can contain security bugs or settings that leak personal data. Set your devices (and the apps on them) them to update automatically. That way you'll always have the latest, safest versions. Step 3. Update your privacy settings | |
| Make sure your devices are using the best privacy settings. Especially make sure you adjust per-app location settings, so that your location history isn’t leaking where it shouldn’t. For extra bonus points, review the apps you have installed. If there are any you haven't used for a while, remove them to reduce the chance of your personal data being shared in the background. Step 4. Use a password manager | |
| Privacy and security are, but if your accounts are not secured, your privacy is at risk. Have you ever used the same password on more than one website? If the answer's yes, then your privacy may be. The fix is easy: start creating unique passwords for every website you use. That may sound like a lot of work, but it’s not when you use a password manager. Password managers generate and store secure passwords for you automatically. Many browsers now have them built-in, or you can use a tool like, or that work across multiple browsers. Step 5. Set up two-factor authentication | |
| Two-factor authentication (also known as multi-step login) is where you use a code to log in to websites in addition to your password. You should set up two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible, and certainly on your major accounts (email, financial, etc. ). You can check if major sites have it available, which also links directly to the right documentation pages. And that’s it. Doing the above five steps makes a huge impact on your privacy online, from stopping Big Tech from sucking up all your browsing data to adding extra protection to your passwords and email. And, once set up, it doesn’t take much effort to maintain. So, let’s make 2020 the year we all take back our online privacy. | |

| Reeya Hazarika,NIT Silchar,"NITs are one of the most reputed colleges in India just behind IITs, some NITs even at par with IITs. Being an engineering aspirant and getting into this institute is almost a dream come true. The process of admission in quite simple - as it has been metioned. An entrance examination called the JEE Mains which tests our knowledge in PCM(Phy,Chem,Maths) is conducted for all of students at 10+2 level of the country (The foreign admission process is different and I don't have much idea about it). On the basis of our ranks (now, the rank was earlier given on the basis of marks but from last year onwards that is 2019 it is percentile based) we get into different NITs into different branches. CSE (Computer Science) being the most sought after branch is always filled in by the top rankers. On the basis of placements, infrastructure and other attributes all the NITs are ranked and some branches in some specific NITs are most sough after in India. (JEE Main score is also checked for some other colleges and there's a minimum percentile in JEE Main which is required to be qualified for appearing in JEE Advanced. The rank in JEE Adv is used for admission into IITs and some more colleges in India. JEE Adv is a must for all Indians and foreigners to get admitted into IIT). Having given all the general information, I will go specific for my college NIT Silchar or NITS. NITS offer 6 courses in BTech. It takes in 50% students from Home State and 50% from other states with horizontal reservation for different categories and within that another horizontal reservation for girls and PWD candidates. After the results of JEE Mains is out, we need to wait for the JoSsa online counseling that allocates seat on the basis of our ranks and our preferred choices taking into consideration all the reservations. It has 7 rounds of seat allocation (with 2 mock rounds) where our choice might improve in the further rounds. There's an entire process of float,slide and freeze. Anyways, after getting the 1st seat in any of the rounds, for instance I was allocated CSE in NITS in the 1st round itself we have to report physically at one of the listed reporting centers and float, slide or freeze our choice. In any case, if and when our final college is allocated at the end of the 7th round we have to physically take admission after paying the requisite fee for hostel and tuition thereby occupying our seat. The dates for allocation are around mid June and the admission dates for different colleges vary as for NITS, it lies in the end July. Last year it lasted from 19th july to 24th. The factors that made me choose this curriculum are the popularity of course, my ambition of following engineering, the placement scenario and the overall development of personality the collegee offers.There are various events being celebrated in our college. Almost everyday, there are different activities ranging from quizzes, jams, sports activities, literary activities, eco club activities, coding classes etc. going on (which naturally clash with each other all the time) but these aside there are 2 most grand events in the college, one being Tecnoesis, the techno-management fest and other the cultural fest, Incandescence. Generally the Tecnoesis is held at the year end in the odd semester and Incand in the even semester. There were some changes last year and both Tecno Incand were held at a closer interval. Tecnoesis has much activites to offer ranging from hackathons, coding contest participated by students from around the world; there are workshops; other robotic events; events under ASME and the guest lecture module. It finally ends with the Spark Night which can be said to be the closing ceremony. Tecnoesis being such hectic, Incandescence on the other hand is relaxing. All we have to do is sit back, relax and enjoy all the events going on. It is the grandest fest in the entire Northeastern India. Many celebrated guests, artists, rappers, metal bands, indie bands are a part of this event. It varies each year but Glitterati, Thundermarch and Carpe Diem are the most prominent events within Incandescence. It also offers prom nights for couples, is the stage for acoustic jam, voice of incand and many more. Apart from these, there is another event called Posua celebrated as a pre-Bihu event. It can be said to be the Spring fest of NIT Silchar. A one day full packed event showcasing talents from nooks and corners of Assam.",6.8 | |

Concurrently, the introduction of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) has generated a substantially increased focus on the potential for degree completion through an online environment. These changes have also generated a significant amount of competitive recruiting, marketing and advertising in efforts to enroll mostly non-traditional (older, returning adult) students, the consumers of higher education.Just consulted thr admission office in the college.

Every faculty in our college is engaged in research. Lab faculty is chilled sometimes but at last you have to study to pass the FAT exam (Final Assessment Test).Some faculty is really good and ready to teach you anything. But some of them are not.

| Pranjal Raj,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"The Gender ratio here in VIT is very good as compared to different colleges. M:F ratio is around 4:1. There are students who come from all across the country and from abroad too. The student diversity is huge, they belong to different places and speak different languages. This college is very conservative college and is intolerant with regards to gender. The main gate in-time and hostel in-time for girls is earlier than that of boys. For the first 4 months after joining the college, the authorities don't allow the students to leave the college campus. If they want to leave for some reason they will have to take permission from their proctor, get him the affirmation of parents to approve the request and then get the permission from the warden of hostel. The college and hostel authorities are weird and strict. The college allow the girls to go out on weekends only for 4 hrs a day and that too with permission of the girls' warden/proctor. The entry and exit from the main gate is biometric based, and many a times they may stop out biometrics and detain us within the campus. It's like house arrest. The freedom given to the students is 0. The college conducts no official student/dorm parties. Even during the Riviera cultural fest concerts, there are barricades which separate boys and girls so that they couldn't dance and enjoy together. There was a Silent disco conducted by a club and in that too the boys and girls were separated in the hall by a barricade and a security guard kept a watch on everyone. There are overly strict anti-PDA rules in the college. There are Red-tag security guards installed in the college whose duty is to be a vigilante over the students. Even if a couple is walking together, that security guard may get pissed and whistle at them, humiliate them and snatch their ID cards. The college has no student council and anyone who dares to raise his voice against the strict college rules are condemned and punished by suspending and rusticating. They justify this by saying that any kind of defamation to the college will not be tolerated. The students are afraid even to write their views openly on quora, so if they ever write anything against unjust college rules they do it anonymouslyThe placement record is very impressive of VIT. Almost all of the students get placed in the end. Placement is 100%. There are over 500-700 which come to the college to offer placements. Those companies are categorised as Super Dream companies and Dream Companies. Super Dream are those which offer a very high package (10+ lakh per annum). For example, Amazon, Google, Directi, Adobe, Microsoft, etc. Then there are Dream companies which offer 6-10 lakh package. Apart from these there are Mass Recruiting Companies (such as TCS, Accenture, Cognizant, Wipro, Infosys) which come to the campus and recruit the students in bulk. They offer a package of around 4-6 lakh per annum. The highest salary package goes upto 40 lakh per annum. The average is around 6 lakh per annum. The college also encourage and provide for Summer and Winter Internships. The placement cell of the college is very active for offering internships. The E-Cell (entrepreneurship cell) also conducts various events such as E-Summit where recruiters and officials from various companies visit the college and interact with the students and offer them internships. Internships could be with or without stipend based on the merit and profile of the student.",7.5 | |
| Akshad Garje,BMS College of Engineering - [BMSCE],"As if I am in mechanical engineering, the placements for mechanical are not upto that level. A few core companies come, but their expectations are quite high, if you score well throughout your course, there is a chance you will be placed in core, otherwise you have to opt for TCS and IT companies. CSE, IT, ETX have a moderate placement record. The college will try to show you 100 % record but it is not correct. you can assume not more than 50% placements from overall branches.Mostly all the festivals are celebrated here. Festivals like Diwali, Christmas, etc. which are celebrated here with full enthusiasm.

We are inclusive of all views and opinions and choices.The course curriculum for a freshie is rather uninteresting but the courses from the sophomore years onwards that are offered by said department are very heavy and useful if you're into research.

| Aayush,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"I gave the entrance exam called viteee for getting admission into vit. Besides this, I gave jee mains and jee advance. I had 96. 38 percentile in jee mains and qualified for jee advance. But I didn't get a seat in BTech Cs or IT program at my current merit. I may get some other branches like mechanical or civil. But since my interest was in cs I looked for other options than IIT or nits. This first name after iits and nits is bits Pilani but then it's exam had a different pattern than regular jee. So same for bits didn't score well enough to get cs. Now comes viteee. It had a similar pattern with jee but had some twist in its questions. I mean some types of questions were different than those in jee syllabus and also it contains 15 English questions. Vitesse contains 30 Physics 30 chemistry 40 maths and 15 English questions of each 1 mark and I have to complete them in 3 hrs. There was no negative marking as time was less. Out of 115 marks score, around 90 may secure a seat of Cs or IT in vit Vellore campus. So I got a rank of around 7000 out of around 1. 25 lakh students who gave the exam and got admission into IT branch for Btech in vit Vellore.There are a lot of extracurricular activities held throughout the year. Workshops will there at any time you say at any day as there are hundreds of clubs and chapters in our college. But the thing is sine them recruitment the students who already know something. So there is a lot of competition in those clubs and chapters. Also, many people sometimes force you to join a club or attend any workshop just to say that they convinced these many people to attend their workshop. On gender(girl/boy ratio) ratio I will say as it is engineering college it is less but it's okayish. Also, vit has offered some kind of schemes like a scholarship or something like that for girls to increase the ratio. But there are many restrictions on girls like their time of college is 2 hrs earlier than that of boys. Also, there are red tag annas (gourds) who watch for PDAs and take action s against it.
