List of admission tests to colleges and universities
This article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. The specific problem is: capitalizations, spacing, bolds, and typos. (May 2017) |
This is a list of standardized tests that students may need to take for admissions to various colleges or universities. Tests of language proficiency are excluded here.
Only tests not included within a certain secondary schooling curriculum are listed. Therefore, those tests initially focused on secondary–school–leaving, e.g., GCE A–Levels in the UK, or French Baccalaureate, are not listed here, although they function as the de facto admission tests in those countries (see list of secondary school leaving certificates).
