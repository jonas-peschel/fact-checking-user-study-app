Here's where the 2024 presidential candidates stand on guns
Gun deaths remain a major problem in the country.
The 2024 presidential candidates have spoken about their policy ideas related to gun violence and gun regulations, as gun deaths remain a major problem in the country.
Over the last four years, at least 2,373 mass shootings have taken place in the U.S., with 385 occurring in 2024 alone as of Sept. 5, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
Here’s a brief look at where the major candidates stand on the issue.
Kamala Harris
Vice President Kamala Harris has touted the administration’s work on enacting the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant federal gun reform in decades. The 2022 law helps states implement "red flag" laws, closes the “boyfriend” loophole and enhances background checks for gun buyers under the age of 21.
Earlier this year, Harris announced the launch of the first-ever National Extreme Risk Protection Order Resource Center to support the effective implementation of state red flag laws.
But Harris has called for more, including nationwide red flag laws, universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. Still, she’s said she is in favor of the Second Amendment while also backing gun safety.
Donald Trump
The former president has claimed to be the "most pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment president," often arguing in the wake of mass shootings that guns were not to blame for the tragedies, but rather a mental health problem.
He has signaled that he would not enact any new gun restrictions if reelected.
