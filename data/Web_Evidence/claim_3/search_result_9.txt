Border & Immigration
After four years of Biden’s open borders, President Donald J. Trump launched an unprecedented crackdown on the illegal immigrants and deadly drugs allowed to enter our country to remarkable success — and he didn’t need legislation to do it.
Day One Achievements
President Trump ended “catch-and-release,” reversing the dangerous Biden-era policy that released dangerous illegal aliens back into our communities.
President Trump shut down the “CBP One” app, which “paroled” more than one million illegal immigrants into the country.
President Trump signed the Laken Riley Act into law, which requires illegal immigrants arrested or charged with theft or violence to be detained — honoring the legacy of Laken Riley, a Georgia college student brutally murdered by an illegal alien released into the country.
President Trump terminated all taxpayer-funded public benefits for illegal aliens.
President Trump re-established the successful “Remain in Mexico” policy.
President Trump restarted construction of the border wall.
The Trump Administration declared Tren de Aragua, MS-13, the Sinaloa Cartel, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, the United Cartels, the Gulf Cartel, the Northeast Cartel, and the Michoacán Family as Foreign Terrorist Organizations.
Milestones
Illegal crossings hit a stunning new low in March, with ICE agents seeing just 7,181 migrants enter the US illegally – a 95% decrease from 2024, a 96% decrease from 2023, and a 97% decrease from 2022.
Keeping with his pledge to launch the largest deportation effort in American history, President Trump has deported more than 100,000 illegal migrants since returning to office on Jan. 20.
Between January 20 and April 1, only 9 illegal aliens were released into the United States, a staggering 99.9% decrease from the 184,241 released into the country under Biden during the same period last year.
Illegal border crossings at the Darien Gap have dropped more than 99% and the number of unaccompanied alien children arriving at the border has hit a record low under President Trump.
