Trump seeks to tie Biden to 'defund the police' demands even though former vice president rejects idea
WASHINGTON – Faced with sobering poll numbers and mounting criticism of his response to the protests sparked by George Floyd's death, President Donald Trump and his advisers are seeking to tie former Vice President Joe Biden to the "defund the police" movement – even though Biden said Monday he opposes that demand from protesters.
The president has turned to this new strategy as his campaign struggles to regain its footing amid the coronavirus pandemic, which halted campaign rallies and decimated the U.S. economy. The nationwide demonstrations over the death of Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody on May 25, have exacerbated Trump's political troubles.
Trump scrapped a planned weekend trip to his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., after a tumultuous week and ongoing fallout over his decision to clear peaceful protesters from a park, so he could pose for a photo op at St. John's Church near the White House. The move prompted a wave of searing criticism from former senior military officials, including his former Defense Secretary James Mattis and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who denounced Trump as "dangerous for our democracy" and said he would once again not vote for the president in November.
The Trump campaign held a series of strategy meetings last week as fresh polling showed the president trailing Biden in national polls and in key battleground states he clinched in 2016, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday showed Biden leading Trump 49% to 42% among registered voters. A CNN poll released on Monday showed Biden's support at 55% to Trump's 41% among registered voters, nearly three times the five-point deficit that CNN's May poll showed.
Trump met with top campaign officials last week, including campaign manager Brad Parscale and his recently appointed deputy Bill Stepien. The president also heard from a larger group of aides about a two-pronged communications strategy to promote economic recovery and attack Biden. The campaign got a boost Friday with a surprise jobs report that showed the unemployment rate dropping to 13.3%, with 2.5 million jobs added to the economy in May.
But the plan to attack Biden came into focus amid growing calls from protesters to "defund the police," a rallying cry that has different meanings for different activists. Some have called for cutting law enforcement budgets and investing more in community programs, while others are pushing for fully abolishing police departments.

Alicia Garza, co-founder of the Black Lives Matter activist group, said the phrase is not about eliminating police but reallocating funding toward "the resources that our communities need," she said on NBC’s “Meet the Press."
The demand for police defunding gained traction over the weekend as demonstrations continued from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. – where activists painted "defund the police" next to the city-approved Black Lives Matter mural that stretches across 16th Street near the White House. A veto-proof majority of Minneapolis' City Council on Sunday pledged they would "begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department," but declined to provide details on what that would mean.
The president and his campaign have seized on the phrase, casting Biden as out of the mainstream by linking him to the slogan. Biden's campaign said Monday the vice president opposed the idea of defunding police departments, but supports police reforms and fighting systemic racism – two other central demands of the protesters.
Trump's campaign is betting that swing voters in the 2020 election will see the defunding of police as a bridge too far.
“There won't be defunding. There won't be dismantling of our police. There is not going to be any disbanding of our police,” Trump said Monday during a roundtable discussion with state, federal and local law enforcement officials at the White House.
He said his administration is looking at some unspecified police reforms "to make sure we don't have any bad actors."
Earlier on Monday the president fired off a series of Twitter missives attacking the "defund police" movement, dismissing CNN's latest polls and praising last week's positive jobs report.
"LAW & ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE," Trump tweeted Monday morning. "The Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!"
Tim Murtaugh, director of communications for the Trump campaign, pointed to the Minneapolis city council decision – as well as Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's plans to redirect some police department funding towards other community programs – as examples of the movement overtaking the Democratic Party.
"This growing call for defunding or disbanding police will only lead to more chaos," Murtaugh told reporters during a campaign call Monday morning.

"As the protesters like to say, silence is agreement," he added. "By his silence Joe Biden is endorsing defunding the police."
But Biden hasn't stayed silent. Following the call, the Biden campaign released a statement explicitly opposing the idea of pulling funding for police departments. Campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said Biden instead supports funding programs that work to improve community relations with police.
Biden has also voiced support for criminal justice reform, including a $300 million investment in community policing and a pledge to create a national police oversight commission within the first 100 days in office.
Bates also took a swipe at Trump, whom he said has made criminal justice reform difficult.
"There are many police departments across the country who are seeking to realize these kinds of changes, but haven't had the resources to – and the Trump administration has in fact made obtaining those resources more difficult," Bates said.
Murtaugh responded by criticizing Biden for issuing "a weak statement from a mid-level staffer" rather than speaking out against the movement himself.
Biden, who traveled with his wife to Houston to meet with Floyd's family on Monday, later slammed Trump in a tweet.
"We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and Donald Trump is patting himself on the back. He just has no idea what’s really going on in this country," he tweeted.
"It's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions," Biden wrote.
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who unveiled sweeping police reform legislation Monday, also distanced herself from the phrase. "Funding of police is a local matter," she said during an interview with MSNBC on Monday.
"What we're doing is talking about how we change policy to make our policing more just," she said.
Recent polls have shown that most Americans support criminal justice reform. The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found voters were more concerned about the actions of police in Floyd's death than the protests that followed, by a more than 2-to-1 ratio. Meanwhile, a Yahoo News/YouGov poll earlier this month showed nearly nine out of 10 Americans support training officers on how to de-escalate conflicts and avoid using force.
Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said Trump is trying to change the nature of the election, from a referendum on himself to a contrast between him and Biden.
That will not be easy, he said. For one thing, Trump likes to brag about himself, and he is now an incumbent with a long record of disputed actions and statements that have alienated many voters.
"He's painted himself into a corner," Rothenberg said. "He is now the underdog."
It will be hard for his campaign to make this election about anything other than Trump.
"I don't think the election is over," Rothenberg said. "But the president's team really needs to pull a rabbit out of a hat here."
In addition to promoting the economy and bashing Biden, Trump plans to reinvigorate his campaign with his favorite events: rallies.
Aides said they plan to hold the first post-pandemic rallies later this month, though they did not say where or under what conditions.
“Americans are ready to get back to action and so is President Trump” Parscale said in a statement. “You’ll again see the kind of crowds and enthusiasm that sleepy Joe Biden can only dream of.”
