Keeping Our Promises: Manufacturers on Eight Years of Tax Reform
Manufacturers championed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, making clear to policymakers that a competitive U.S. tax code would empower the industry to invest, create jobs and grow the American economy.
In the nearly eight years since tax reform’s passage, manufacturers have kept their promises.
Key Policy Resources
Millions of American workers are depending on the manufacturing sector to continue driving America forward. Pro-growth tax policies from the 2017 tax reforms, which were rocket fuel for manufacturers, proved this by keeping the U.S. economy competitive on a global scale.
By preventing pro-growth tax policies from expiring in 2025, Congress will preserve a competitive tax system that spurs job growth across our communities, secures the U.S. as a global leader in innovation and reinforces America’s competitiveness on the world stage.
Below are critical policy recommendations crafted by the NAM that Congress and the president should act on to prevent damaging tax increases from stunting manufacturing job creation, growth and innovation.
