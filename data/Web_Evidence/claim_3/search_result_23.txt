The Department of Homeland Security is committed to enforcing our immigration laws so that we can secure our border and keep the American people safe. DHS is taking action to disrupt cartels, smugglers, and nefarious actors. These actions include referring and then prosecuting 100 percent of illegal border crossers, building the first new border wall in a decade, and deploying the National Guard to the border.
However, smugglers, human traffickers, and nefarious actors know our loopholes well and continue to exploit them. To truly keep the American people safe, we must end legal loopholes that have left us with policies that serve as tremendous magnets for illegal immigration.
