Project 2025, Explained
Learn more about The Heritage Foundation initiative that threatens to erode our civil rights and civil liberties during a second Trump term.
The ACLU doesn’t endorse or oppose candidates for elected office — but we recognize that the re-election of Donald Trump as president will have immense implications for the future of our democratic norms, institutions, and processes. In 2022, The Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank, and 140 former Trump staffers authored Project 2025 -- a roadmap for how to replace the rule of law with ring-wing ideals.

What is Project 2025?
Project 2025 is a federal policy agenda and blueprint for a radical restructuring of the executive branch authored and published by former Trump administration officials in partnership with The Heritage Foundation, a longstanding conservative think tank that opposes abortion and reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, immigrants’ rights, and racial equity. Project 2025’s largest publication, “Mandate For Leadership,” is a 900-page manual for reorganizing the entire federal government agency by agency to serve a conservative agenda.

Project 2025 includes a long list of extreme policy recommendations touching on nearly every aspect of American life, from immigration and abortion rights, to free speech and racial justice. A number of its recommendations rely on support from the executive branch and from Congress. Many other initiatives are outright unconstitutional.
What Are Some Plans/Proposals Included in Project 2025?
Project 2025 calls for hundreds of individual policy changes that will impact our constitutional freedoms, and every aspect of our lives. Among them are:
Gutting Abortion Access
The Plan:
- Revive a 19th century law, the Comstock Act, to ban any abortion medications and materials preventing materials from being sent through the U.S. Postal Service
- Reversal of the FDA’s approval of mifepristone

What are President-Elect Trump’s connections to Project 2025?
Project 2025 was published by The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank with direct ties to Trump’s first administration. Though Trump has falsely claimed he is not connected to Project 2025, a recent report from CNN found at least 140 people who worked on Project 2025 that previously worked in Trump’s administration, and Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts–who previously worked on Trump’s transition team in 2016–has described his organization’s role as “institutionalizing Trumpism.”
Roberts was also one of the principle advocates for overturning the 2020 election to keep Donald Trump in office after he lost the election. Heritage Foundation executive Mike Howell called the 2024 election illegitimate before voting even began, claiming without evidence that any result other than a Trump victory will have been the result of fraud.
How is the ACLU Fighting Back?
In a series of seven memos, the ACLU details the civil rights and civil liberties challenges that a second Trump presidency will present and provides a roadmap for how we will fight to protect and expand the freedom of all people. This includes:
- Going to court to preserve and advance the rights of immigrants, LGBTQ rights, abortion access, nondiscrimination laws, voting rights, and the free speech of all people
- Working with Congress members to enact policy solutions to many of the most extreme proposals in Project 2025 and using Congress’s constitutional powers to provide oversight, investigate wrongdoing, and defund executive branch policies that threaten our most fundamental rights and freedoms
- Working with state lawmakers around the country to enact proactive laws that protect people from federal interference.
- Organizing in communities to educate the public about their rights, the harms of Project 2025, and what they can do to protect and expand our freedoms
