About
U.S. Senator Rand Paul, M.D., is recognized as one of the nation’s leading advocates for liberty. As a fierce advocate against government overreach, Dr. Paul has fought tirelessly to return government to its limited, constitutional scope. As a hard-working and dedicated physician, Dr. Paul came to Washington to make a difference, and he has remained true to his principles.
During his time in the Senate, Dr. Paul has never voted for an unbalanced budget, has returned $8.3 million to the Treasury from his Senate budget, and is known for his annual detailed analysis of government waste. Dr. Paul serves as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, where he conducts oversight and works to keep government accountable to the people.
Dr. Paul is a devoted husband, father of three, and grandfather, and has been married for 34 years to Kelley Ashby Paul. Rand and Kelley are both devout Christians and are active in their local church. Dr. Paul attended Baylor University, graduated from Duke Medical School and completed a general surgery internship at Georgia Baptist Medical Center.
After completing his residency in ophthalmology at Duke University Medical Center, Dr. Paul and Kelley moved to Bowling Green to start their family and begin his ophthalmology practice, where he was a successful eye surgeon for seventeen years before running for the U.S. Senate.
Dr. Paul founded the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic, an organization that provides eye exams and surgery to needy families and individuals.
As a Senator, Dr. Paul has given of his time and skill by performing pro-bono eye surgeries for patients across Kentucky as well as around the world. He has performed eye surgery as part of medical mission trips to Guatemala and Haiti, where he restored the vision of hundreds of people who were blind with cataracts.
Dr. Paul is the author of six books, the most recent being Deception, The Great Covid Coverup and The Case Against Socialism.
Dr. Paul’s entrance into politics is indicative of his life’s work as a surgeon: a desire to diagnose problems and provide practical solutions, whether it be in Bowling Green, Ky., or Washington, D.C.
